### [2] [Agent Exchange: Shaping the Future of AI Agent Economics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03904)
*Yingxuan Yang,Ying Wen,Jun Wang,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agent Exchange (AEX), an auction platform for AI agents to autonomously participate in an agent-centric economy, inspired by Real-Time Bidding systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLMs has enabled AI agents to act as autonomous economic actors, necessitating a platform like AEX to facilitate their coordination and economic participation.

Method: AEX is designed as a central auction engine with four ecosystem components: User-Side Platform (USP), Agent-Side Platform (ASP), Agent Hubs, and Data Management Platform (DMP).

Result: The paper outlines the design principles and system architecture of AEX, enabling agent-based economic infrastructure.

Conclusion: AEX lays the groundwork for future AI ecosystems by supporting autonomous agent coordination and economic interactions.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed AI agents from
passive computational tools into autonomous economic actors. This shift marks
the emergence of the agent-centric economy, in which agents take on active
economic roles-exchanging value, making strategic decisions, and coordinating
actions with minimal human oversight. To realize this vision, we propose Agent
Exchange (AEX), a specialized auction platform designed to support the dynamics
of the AI agent marketplace. AEX offers an optimized infrastructure for agent
coordination and economic participation. Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB)
systems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine,
facilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side
Platform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the
Agent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation,
performance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent
teams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform
(DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline
the design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for
agent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.

### [3] [Discovering Algorithms with Computational Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03190)
*Theo Bourdais,Abeynaya Gnanasekaran,Houman Owhadi,Tuhin Sahai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework automates algorithm discovery by representing algorithms as token sequences, using MCTS and RL to generate and improve algorithms, outperforming existing methods for NP-hard and quantum computing problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and enhance algorithm discovery by conceptualizing algorithms as sequences of operations, enabling tailored solutions for specific problem instances.

Method: Uses token sequences and a grammar to represent algorithms, with ensemble MCTS guided by RL to explore and generate new tokens and procedures.

Result: Rediscovered, improved, and generated new algorithms that outperform existing methods for NP-hard combinatorial optimization and quantum computing problems.

Conclusion: The framework operates at a computational level, producing tailored algorithms for specific problem instances, advancing automated algorithm discovery.

Abstract: Algorithms are the engine for reproducible problem-solving. We present a
framework automating algorithm discovery by conceptualizing them as sequences
of operations, represented as tokens. These computational tokens are chained
using a grammar, enabling the formation of increasingly sophisticated
procedures. Our ensemble Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by reinforcement
learning (RL) explores token chaining and drives the creation of new tokens.
This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that
substantially outperform existing methods for strongly NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problems and foundational quantum computing approaches such as
Grover's and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Operating at the
computational rather than code-generation level, our framework produces
algorithms that can be tailored specifically to problem instances, not merely
classes.

### [4] [CortexDebate: Debating Sparsely and Equally for Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03928)
*Yiliu Sun,Zicheng Zhao,Sheng Wan,Chen Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CortexDebate addresses issues in Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) by introducing a sparse debating graph and a trust-based optimization module (MDM), improving performance and reducing overconfidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single LLMs suffer from hallucination and poor reasoning, and existing MAD methods struggle with lengthy inputs and overconfidence.

Method: Proposes CortexDebate, a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, optimized using the MDM module based on the McKinsey Trust Formula.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness across eight datasets from four task types.

Conclusion: CortexDebate improves MAD by optimizing agent interactions and trustworthiness, addressing key limitations.

Abstract: Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues
such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these
issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where
LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing
MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes
LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences
performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM
agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate".
Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically
optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate
constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only
debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose
a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial
analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a
well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables
credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our
CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results
across eight datasets from four task types.

### [5] [SI-Agent: An Agentic Framework for Feedback-Driven Generation and Tuning of Human-Readable System Instructions for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03223)
*Jeshwanth Challagundla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SI-Agent automates human-readable system instruction generation for LLMs using a feedback-driven loop with three agents, outperforming baselines in performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual crafting of system instructions for LLMs is resource-intensive and suboptimal, while automated methods often lack interpretability.

Method: SI-Agent employs three agents (Instructor, Follower, Feedback) in an iterative loop, refining instructions via feedback (e.g., LLM-based editing, evolutionary algorithms).

Result: SI-Agent generates effective, readable instructions, balancing performance and interpretability better than baselines.

Conclusion: The framework democratizes LLM customization and enhances transparency, though computational costs and feedback reliability remain challenges.

Abstract: System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often
suboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable
"soft prompts," sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a
novel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively
refine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs
three collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent
(target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and
optionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where
feedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing,
evolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles,
the iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We
present experimental results validating SI-Agent's effectiveness, focusing on
metrics for task performance, SI readability, and efficiency. Our findings
indicate that SI-Agent generates effective, readable SIs, offering a favorable
trade-off between performance and interpretability compared to baselines.
Potential implications include democratizing LLM customization and enhancing
model transparency. Challenges related to computational cost and feedback
reliability are acknowledged.

### [6] [HAWK: A Hierarchical Workflow Framework for Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04067)
*Yuyang Cheng,Yumiao Xu,Chaojia Yu,Yong Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAWK is a modular framework for multi-agent systems, addressing interoperability, scheduling, and resource sharing with standardized interfaces and adaptive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and resource sharing in multi-agent systems motivate the need for a robust framework like HAWK.

Method: HAWK uses a five-layer architecture (User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, Resource) with 16 standardized interfaces, adaptive scheduling, and unified resource abstraction.

Result: Demonstrated via CreAgentive, HAWK improves throughput, reduces complexity, and enhances controllability, while integrating large language models seamlessly.

Conclusion: HAWK is scalable and flexible, with future research focusing on hallucination mitigation, real-time tuning, and cross-domain adaptability, applicable in healthcare, finance, and more.

Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in
cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient
resource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack
standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to
extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization
is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular
framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and
Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an
end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent
scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an
adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which
harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize
utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over
heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party
services&tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate
HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent
novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers
invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how
hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK,
highlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research
avenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced
cross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare,
government, finance, and education.

### [7] [Efficient Knowledge Graph Construction and Retrieval from Unstructured Text for Large-Scale RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03226)
*Congmin Min,Rhea Mathew,Joyce Pan,Sahil Bansal,Abbas Keshavarzi,Amar Viswanathan Kannan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A scalable, cost-efficient GraphRAG framework for enterprises, reducing reliance on LLMs and improving retrieval latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high computational costs and latency in GraphRAG adoption for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval.

Method: Introduces dependency-based knowledge graph construction (no LLMs) and lightweight graph retrieval with hybrid query node identification and one-hop traversal.

Result: Achieves 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines, with 94% performance of LLM-generated graphs at lower cost.

Conclusion: Validates feasibility of GraphRAG in large-scale enterprise applications, offering practical, explainable, and adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based
Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While
GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval,
its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing
knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of
graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core
innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that
leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from
unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a
lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node
identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency
subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on
legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system
achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based
on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based
construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge
graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving
scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG
systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring
prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable,
and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

### [8] [Enhancing Robustness of LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems through Randomized Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04105)
*Jinwei Hu,Yi Dong,Zhengtao Ding,Xiaowei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A defense framework using randomized smoothing for LLM-based multi-agent systems in safety-critical domains, ensuring robust consensus under adversarial influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance safety in LLM-empowered multi-agent systems, especially in critical domains like aerospace, by addressing adversarial risks and hallucinations.

Method: Applies randomized smoothing for probabilistic guarantees, using a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism for robustness and efficiency.

Result: Simulations show effective prevention of adversarial behavior and hallucinations while maintaining consensus performance.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable solution for safe deployment of LLM-based MAS in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a defense framework for enhancing the safety of large
language model (LLM) empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) in safety-critical
domains such as aerospace. We apply randomized smoothing, a statistical
robustness certification technique, to the MAS consensus context, enabling
probabilistic guarantees on agent decisions under adversarial influence. Unlike
traditional verification methods, our approach operates in black-box settings
and employs a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism to balance robustness and
computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method
effectively prevents the propagation of adversarial behaviors and
hallucinations while maintaining consensus performance. This work provides a
practical and scalable path toward safe deployment of LLM-based MAS in
real-world, high-stakes environments.

### [9] [CodeAgents: A Token-Efficient Framework for Codified Multi-Agent Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03254)
*Bruce Yang,Xinfeng He,Huan Gao,Yifan Cao,Xiaofan Li,David Hsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CodeAgents introduces a structured prompting framework for multi-agent LLM systems, improving planning performance and token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompting strategies lack modularity, scalability, and token efficiency in multi-agent environments.

Method: CodeAgents codifies multi-agent reasoning into modular pseudocode with control structures, boolean logic, and typed variables.

Result: Achieves 3-36% performance gains and reduces token usage by 55-87% (input) and 41-70% (output).

Conclusion: CodeAgents enhances interpretability, scalability, and efficiency in multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Effective prompt design is essential for improving the planning capabilities
of large language model (LLM)-driven agents. However, existing structured
prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,
and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking
critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in
multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce
CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and
enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In
CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system
roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode
enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic,
and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into
cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We
evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA,
HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show
consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36
percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome,
our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition,
our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%,
respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in
the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems. The code and resources are

*Georgios Ioannides,Christos Constantinou,Vinija Jain,Aman Chadha,Aaron Elkins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOD-X is a new framework for agent interoperability, featuring a layered architecture with a Universal Message Bus, state management, translation, and blockchain security. It enables integration of diverse agents without central coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of specialized AI agents necessitates standardized communication protocols for interoperability, which current solutions lack.

Method: MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with features like a Universal Message Bus, semantic discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration.

Result: MOD-X successfully integrates heterogeneous agents, demonstrating scalability and decentralization.

Conclusion: MOD-X provides a practical, decentralized solution for interoperable agent ecosystems, bridging theory and implementation.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to
ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication
protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular
Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for
agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols.
Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a
Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and
blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare
it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked
example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents
(agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge
representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic
reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key
innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic
capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework
that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This
architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable
agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central
coordination.

### [11] [GDGB: A Benchmark for Generative Dynamic Text-Attributed Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03267)
*Jie Peng,Jiarui Ji,Runlin Lei,Zhewei Wei,Yongchao Liu,Chuntao Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GDGB, a benchmark for DyTAG generation tasks, addressing poor textual quality in existing datasets and lack of standardized evaluation. It defines two tasks (TDGG and IDGG) and proposes GAG-General, an LLM-based framework, for robust benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DyTAG datasets have poor textual quality and lack standardized tasks for DyTAG generation, limiting their utility.

Method: Proposes GDGB with eight high-quality DyTAG datasets, defines TDGG and IDGG tasks, and introduces GAG-General for evaluation.

Result: GDGB enables rigorous evaluation, revealing the interplay of structural and textual features in DyTAG generation.

Conclusion: GDGB serves as a foundational resource for advancing generative DyTAG research and practical applications.

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs), which intricately integrate
structural, temporal, and textual attributes, are crucial for modeling complex
real-world systems. However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor
textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks
requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on
discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task
formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address
these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which
comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual
features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.
Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive
Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).
TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and
destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node
generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.
To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the
structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further
propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for
reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key
insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in
DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for
advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical
applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards
are available at \href{https://gdgb-algo.github.io/}{here}.

### [12] [MARBLE: A Multi-Agent Rule-Based LLM Reasoning Engine for Accident Severity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04893)
*Kaleem Ullah Qasim,Jiashu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MARBLE, a multiagent rule-based LLM engine, outperforms traditional methods in accident severity prediction, achieving 90% accuracy by decomposing tasks across specialized agents for interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with incomplete data, feature dependencies, and class imbalance, limiting accuracy and interpretability in real-world settings.

Method: MARBLE uses specialized reasoning agents for scoped feature subsets, coordinated via rule-based or LLM-guided consensus, with structured traces for interpretability.

Result: MARBLE achieves 90% accuracy, surpassing traditional ML and SOTA prompt-based methods (CoT, L2M, ToT) which plateau below 48%.

Conclusion: MARBLE offers a generalizable, interpretable framework for safety-critical applications, redefining performance under noise and class imbalance.

Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety
systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong
feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but
high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods
often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale
in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that
decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning
agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a
semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling
scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation.
Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus
mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system
retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes,
supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics.
Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional
machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning
methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and
Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below
48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity
classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results
position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning
under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

*Jianyu Zhang,Léon Bottou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memory Mosaics v2, scaled to 10B size and trained on 1T tokens, outperform transformers in new-knowledge storage and in-context learning, even when transformers are trained on 8T tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that Memory Mosaics retain their compositional and in-context learning capabilities when scaled to large language model sizes (e.g., llama-8B) and real-world datasets.

Method: Scale Memory Mosaics to 10B size, train on 1T tokens, introduce architectural modifications (Memory Mosaics v2), and evaluate across three dimensions: training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.

Result: Memory Mosaics v2 match transformers on training-knowledge storage and significantly outperform them on new-knowledge storage and in-context learning, even with less training data.

Conclusion: Memory Mosaics v2 are superior to transformers for new tasks and in-context learning, highlighting their scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Memory Mosaics [Zhang et al., 2025], networks of associative memories, have
demonstrated appealing compositional and in-context learning capabilities on
medium-scale networks (GPT-2 scale) and synthetic small datasets. This work
shows that these favorable properties remain when we scale memory mosaics to
large language model sizes (llama-8B scale) and real-world datasets.
  To this end, we scale memory mosaics to 10B size, we train them on one
trillion tokens, we introduce a couple architectural modifications ("Memory
Mosaics v2"), we assess their capabilities across three evaluation dimensions:
training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.
  Throughout the evaluation, memory mosaics v2 match transformers on the
learning of training knowledge (first dimension) and significantly outperforms
transformers on carrying out new tasks at inference time (second and third
dimensions). These improvements cannot be easily replicated by simply
increasing the training data for transformers. A memory mosaics v2 trained on
one trillion tokens still perform better on these tasks than a transformer
trained on eight trillion tokens.

*Benjamin Li,Shuyang Shi,Lucia Romero,Huao Li,Yaqi Xie,Woojun Kim,Stefanos Nikolaidis,Michael Lewis,Katia Sycara,Simon Stepputtis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TALENTS is a framework for adaptive teamwork in human-agent collaboration, using a variational autoencoder to learn and adapt to diverse partner strategies in real time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting to heterogeneous teammates, especially in dynamic, high-pressure tasks, is crucial for successful collaboration.

Method: Uses a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space, clusters strategies, and trains a cooperator agent. A regret minimization algorithm adapts to unseen partners.

Result: Outperforms baselines in the Overcooked environment with unfamiliar human partners.

Conclusion: TALENTS enables effective ad-hoc teamwork by dynamically adapting to diverse partner strategies.

Abstract: In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary
requirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in
human-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to
their human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in
tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can
change rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned
cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range
of partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a
variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data.
This latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ.
Subsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering
the data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each
type of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to
previously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization
algorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically.
We assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment,
posing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination
across a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show
that our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human
partners.

*Anand Gokhale,Vaibhav Srivastava,Francesco Bullo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A modular actor-critic architecture (LTLCrit) guides LLMs in long-term planning using linear temporal logic (LTL) to prevent unsafe behavior, improving efficiency and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with error accumulation in long-term planning, limiting their safe and efficient use in dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes LTLCrit, an LLM critic using LTL to analyze trajectories and generate constraints, paired with an LLM actor for action selection.

Result: Achieves 100% completion rates and higher efficiency in Minecraft diamond-mining compared to baseline LLM planners.

Conclusion: LLMs supervising each other via logic (LTL) enhances safe, generalizable decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and
general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks,
however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient
behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular
actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a
trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).
Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the
guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural
language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes
new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient
behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety
constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term
efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve
as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize
planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to
analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules
that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft
diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving
efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling
LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm
for safe, generalizable decision making.

Conclusion: Domain-specific embedding architectures are crucial for neuroscience RAG systems and clinical NLP.

Abstract: We present NDAI-NeuroMAP, the first neuroscience-domain-specific dense vector
embedding model engineered for high-precision information retrieval tasks. Our
methodology encompasses the curation of an extensive domain-specific training
corpus comprising 500,000 carefully constructed triplets
(query-positive-negative configurations), augmented with 250,000
neuroscience-specific definitional entries and 250,000 structured
knowledge-graph triplets derived from authoritative neurological ontologies. We
employ a sophisticated fine-tuning approach utilizing the
FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023 foundation model, implementing a multi-objective
optimization framework combining contrastive learning with triplet-based metric
learning paradigms. Comprehensive evaluation on a held-out test dataset
comprising approximately 24,000 neuroscience-specific queries demonstrates
substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art general-purpose and
biomedical embedding models. These empirical findings underscore the critical
importance of domain-specific embedding architectures for neuroscience-oriented
RAG systems and related clinical natural language processing applications.

*Franklin Mingzhe Li,Kaitlyn Ng,Bin Zhu,Patrick Carrington*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OSCAR is a pipeline for tracking cooking progress for visually impaired individuals using object status recognition, improving step prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooking is challenging for people with vision impairments due to lack of contextual feedback. Object status offers untapped potential for assistive cooking.

Method: OSCAR integrates recipe parsing, object status extraction, visual alignment, and time-causal modeling for real-time step tracking.

Result: Evaluated on 173 videos and 12 real-world sessions, OSCAR improves step prediction accuracy and identifies real-world performance factors.

Conclusion: OSCAR advances context-aware cooking support, providing a pipeline, dataset, and design insights for future assistive systems.

Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet
remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support
for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the
condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but
underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we
present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical
pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe
progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing,
object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal
modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173
instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions
recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status
consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models,
and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such
as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline
of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual
cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive
cooking systems.

*Ashutosh Hathidara,Julien Yu,Sebastian Schreiber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiaFORGE improves LLM tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and 49 pp over Claude-3.5-Sonnet via a disambiguation-centric pipeline, fine-tuning, and dynamic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with near-duplicate tools and underspecified arguments when invoking enterprise APIs.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (i) synthesizes persona-driven dialogues, (ii) fine-tunes models with reasoning traces, (iii) evaluates with dynamic benchmarks.

Result: 27 pp and 49 pp improvement over GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, respectively.

Conclusion: DiaFORGE offers a reliable blueprint for enterprise-ready tool-calling agents, supported by an open corpus of API specs and dialogues.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise
APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user
intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce
DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a
disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes
persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish
among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source
models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates
real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live
agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional
static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE
raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we
release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications
paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a
practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling
agents.

*Sachith Gunasekara,Yasiru Ratnayake*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares structured (JSON) and unstructured reasoning in LLMs, finding unstructured reasoning outperforms structured methods, especially in complex tasks like MATH.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance trade-offs between structured outputs and unconstrained natural language in LLM reasoning, and challenges with compute budget and faithfulness in CoT models.

Method: Introduces iSelf-Discover, an instance-level adaptation of Self-Discover, to compare dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with unstructured reasoning.

Result: Unstructured reasoning consistently outperforms structured, with up to 18.90% improvement on MATH. Zero-shot unstructured variants beat five-shot structured ones.

Conclusion: Findings suggest re-evaluating reliance on structured formats for complex problem-solving and organization of compound systems.

Abstract: The drive for predictable LLM reasoning in their integration with compound
systems has popularized structured outputs, yet concerns remain about
performance trade-offs compared to unconstrained natural language. At the same
time, training on unconstrained Chain of Thought (CoT) traces has brought about
a new class of strong reasoning models that nevertheless present novel compute
budget and faithfulness challenges. This paper introduces iSelf-Discover, an
instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, and using it compares
dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with its unstructured
counterpart. Our empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks using
state-of-the-art open-source models supports a consistent advantage for
unstructured reasoning. Notably, on the complex MATH benchmark, unstructured
plans achieved relative performance improvements of up to 18.90\% over
structured approaches. Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also
shown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the
significance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated
to ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the
optimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is
context-dependent. These findings invite re-evaluation of the reliance on
structured formats for complex problem-solving and how compound systems should
be organized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the complexity, cost, and inefficiency of traditional drug discovery by exploring AI/ML integration across the entire pipeline.

Method: Holistic analysis of AI/ML applications in target identification, hit screening, and lead optimization, supported by a case study.

Result: Demonstrates AI/ML's practical impact in drug discovery, with real-world successes in molecular target and candidate discovery.

Conclusion: The review provides guidance for leveraging AI/ML to overcome bottlenecks and accelerate drug discovery, highlighting future research directions.

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug
discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged
timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there
is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively
integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews
often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the
dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and
lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and
holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting
significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further
illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case
study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy,
highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and
therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant
challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research
directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for
researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and
accelerate drug discovery.

TL;DR: The paper compares current AI scheming research to 1970s primate language studies, warning against pitfalls like overattribution of human traits and lack of theory. It suggests improvements for rigorous research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight potential flaws in current AI scheming research by drawing parallels with historical primate language studies, aiming to improve scientific rigor.

Method: Comparative analysis of current AI scheming research and 1970s primate language studies, identifying common pitfalls and proposing solutions.

Result: Identifies issues like overattribution, reliance on anecdotes, and lack of theory in AI scheming research, similar to past primate studies.

Conclusion: Recommends avoiding historical pitfalls and outlines steps for advancing AI scheming research with greater rigor and theoretical grounding.

Abstract: We examine recent research that asks whether current AI systems may be
developing a capacity for "scheming" (covertly and strategically pursuing
misaligned goals). We compare current research practices in this field to those
adopted in the 1970s to test whether non-human primates could master natural
language. We argue that there are lessons to be learned from that historical
research endeavour, which was characterised by an overattribution of human
traits to other agents, an excessive reliance on anecdote and descriptive
analysis, and a failure to articulate a strong theoretical framework for the
research. We recommend that research into AI scheming actively seeks to avoid
these pitfalls. We outline some concrete steps that can be taken for this
research programme to advance in a productive and scientifically rigorous
fashion.

*Weitong Zhang,Mengyun Qiao,Chengqi Zang,Steven Niederer,Paul M Matthews,Wenjia Bai,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MESHAgents, a multi-agent framework using large language models to dynamically identify associations between imaging phenotypes and disease factors, outperforming traditional methods in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for identifying associations between imaging phenotypes and disease factors are limited by human-driven hypothesis testing, often missing complex dependencies.

Method: The MESHAgents framework employs AI agents from various disciplines to iteratively generate insights and synthesize correlations for phenome-wide association studies.

Result: MESHAgents autonomously identified additional confounders and achieved comparable performance to expert-selected phenotypes in disease classification tasks, with improved recall for most diseases.

Conclusion: MESHAgents offers a scalable, automated alternative to expert-driven methods, providing clinically relevant phenotypes with transparent reasoning.

Abstract: Identifying the associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk
factors and outcomes is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and
improving diagnosis and prognosis models. However, traditional approaches rely
on human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often
overlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other
multi-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory
Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language
models as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and
phenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of
concept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --
spanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which
spontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,
self-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical
correlations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for
phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's
capabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the
heart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging
phenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional
confounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on
diagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve
performance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences
as small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score
improves for 6 out of 9 disease types. Our framework provides clinically
relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, offering a scalable
alternative to expert-driven methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if LLMs can effectively act as agents in real estate transactions and services like humans.

Method: Developed REAL, a suite with 5,316 entries across 4 topics (memory, comprehension, reasoning, hallucination) and 14 categories.

Result: Advanced LLMs show notable shortcomings in real estate applications.

Conclusion: LLMs need substantial improvement to be viable in real estate transactions and services.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has greatly promoted the
progress of chatbot in multiple fields. There is an urgent need to evaluate
whether LLMs can play the role of agent in housing transactions and services as
well as humans. We present Real Estate Agent Large Language Model Evaluation

the field of housing transactions and services. REAL comprises 5,316
high-quality evaluation entries across 4 topics: memory, comprehension,
reasoning and hallucination. All these entries are organized as 14 categories
to assess whether LLMs have the knowledge and ability in housing transactions
and services scenario. Additionally, the REAL is used to evaluate the
performance of most advanced LLMs. The experiment results indicate that LLMs
still have significant room for improvement to be applied in the real estate
field.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper clarifies the distinction between oversight and control in AI supervision, proposing a framework, a maturity model, and highlighting their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the conflation of oversight and control in AI discourse, which hinders effective system design and evaluation.

Method: A critical review of non-AI supervision literature, differentiation of control and oversight, and development of a framework and maturity model.

Result: A framework for meaningful supervision, a maturity model for AI supervision, and identification of boundaries where supervision fails.

Conclusion: The paper provides tools for regulators and practitioners to assess supervision feasibility and highlights gaps needing further innovation.

Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key
levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to
fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are
frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy
discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain
under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision
outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to
AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and
operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either
a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims
to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,
remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight
strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a
theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the
conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and
what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how
supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,
and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a
maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some
boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,
and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the
question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment
context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying
both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical
advances.

### [25] [A Universal Approach to Feature Representation in Dynamic Task Assignment Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03579)
*Riccardo Lo Bianco,Remco Dijkman,Wim Nuijten,Willem van Jaarsveld*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph-based method and adapted DRL algorithm to solve dynamic task assignment problems with infinite state and action spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of representing infinite state and action spaces in DRL for task assignment problems.

Method: Uses assignment graphs for representation, maps Colored Petri Nets to these graphs, and adapts Proximal Policy Optimization for learning.

Result: The method effectively represents and learns near-optimal policies across varying state and action space dimensionalities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is versatile and scalable for dynamic task assignment problems.

Abstract: Dynamic task assignment concerns the optimal assignment of resources to tasks
in a business process. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been
proposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods
usually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy
function, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the
possible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible
assignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN
remains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features
with an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper
proposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with
infinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:
(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call
assignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment
graphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that
can learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.
To evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal
assignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space
dimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for
representing and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless
of the state and action space dimensionalities.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG for ORAN, showing GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG in factual correctness and context relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs for telecom tasks and improve domain adaptation in ORAN using RAG methods.

Method: Comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications, assessing performance with metrics like faithfulness and factual correctness.

Result: GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG; Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, and GraphRAG improves context relevance by 7%.

Conclusion: GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG are effective alternatives to traditional RAG for ORAN, offering improved performance in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling
autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN
architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps
and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for
telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through
in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While
traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such
as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval
strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding.
Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven
evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study,
we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid
GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying
question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness,
answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that
both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG
improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance
by 7%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAS frameworks lack dynamic evolution, performance optimization, and unified algorithm integration.

Method: EvoAgentX uses a modular architecture with five layers, integrating TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO for optimization.

Result: EvoAgentX improves performance by 7.44% in HotPotQA, 10.00% in MBPP and MATH, and up to 20.00% in GAIA.

Conclusion: EvoAgentX effectively automates and optimizes multi-agent workflows, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to
collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often
require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic
evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization
algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we
present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation,
execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX
employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic
components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,
within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization
algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts,
tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on
HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and
mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world
tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently
achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in
HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve
accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA. The

*Rebekah A. Gelpí,Eric Xue,William A. Cunningham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combines LLMs and Bayesian inverse planning for Theory of Mind (ToM), improving accuracy and scalability over standalone methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of Bayesian inverse planning (scalability) and LLMs (brittleness) in ToM tasks by leveraging their complementary strengths.

Method: Uses LLMs for hypothesis generation and likelihood functions, integrated with Bayesian inverse planning to compute posterior probabilities for mental states.

Result: Outperforms standalone LLMs or Bayesian models, even with smaller LLMs, and shows promise for open-ended tasks.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach offers a robust solution for ToM tasks and potential for socially intelligent generative agents.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) that uses large
language models (LLMs) as a mechanism for generating hypotheses and likelihood
functions with a Bayesian inverse planning model that computes posterior
probabilities for an agent's likely mental states given its actions. Bayesian
inverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of
ToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these
predictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and
actions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in
solving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning
tasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By
combining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each
component, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse
planning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs
alone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically
perform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict
mental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future
development of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative
agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tunsr is a unified neurosymbolic framework for KG reasoning that integrates neural and symbolic methods, addressing diverse reasoning scenarios through a consistent reasoning graph and forward logic message-passing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KG reasoning methods focus on single neural or symbolic approaches and lack versatility for diverse real-world tasks.

Method: Tunsr uses a reasoning graph and forward logic message-passing to update propositional and FOL representations, merging rules via relation merging and inducing rules with the FARI algorithm.

Result: Tunsr demonstrates effectiveness across 19 datasets in four reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation).

Conclusion: Tunsr successfully unifies neural and symbolic reasoning, offering a versatile solution for diverse KG reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the
fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its
ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the
availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods
predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning,
failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches.
Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a
single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse
demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic
methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as
there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural
networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and
specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified
neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first
introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query
entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching
posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is
proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as
well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In
this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by
merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is
proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations
over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four
reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.

Result: Demonstrates how iterative LLM interactions can facilitate interdisciplinary research, with a successful application in computational biology.

Conclusion: LLMs should augment human efforts within a responsible framework to accelerate cross-disciplinary research and scientific discoveries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools
transforming how research is conducted. However, their use in research has been
met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential
harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use.
Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary
research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration
across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the
capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational
biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how
iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary
collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative
tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that
the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research
and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.

*Riya Naik,Ashwin Srinivasan,Swati Agarwal,Estrid He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an agent-based architecture to enhance LLM-based QA systems by resolving question ambiguities and incompleteness, improving interaction efficiency and answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tediousness and inefficiency of multi-turn interactions with LLMs for clarifying contextual information, the study aims to automate the resolution of question deficiencies.

Method: The approach uses LLM-based agents (GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-4-Scout) as zero-shot ReAct agents to classify, resolve, or answer questions, reducing human interaction length and improving answer quality.

Result: Agent-based systems shorten interactions, enhance answer quality, and provide explainable resolutions, though they may increase LLM invocations and latency. Benefits outweigh costs except for well-contextualized questions.

Conclusion: Agent-based architectures can robustly improve LLM-based QA systems by automating deficiency resolution, making them more efficient and reliable.

Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of
question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn
activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to
clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In
this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based
Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine
the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in
questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on
several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these
deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and
Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving
deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as
zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the
model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)
decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)
determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers
the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without
the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents
with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An
improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies
in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional
LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,
the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient
context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to
harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore neuroevolution's potential in complex, visually rich games without relying on explicit game-state information.

Method: Uses NEAT to evolve neural networks from raw pixel data, aided by the Dark Souls API (DSAPI) for real-time computer vision.

Result: Evolved agents achieve a 35% success rate against the Asylum Demon, showcasing neuroevolution's viability.

Conclusion: Neuroevolution is promising for complex games lacking API support or clear state representations.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Neuroevolution of Augmenting
Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in Dark Souls, a notoriously challenging
action role-playing game characterized by complex combat mechanics, dynamic
environments, and high-dimensional visual inputs. Unlike traditional
reinforcement learning or game playing approaches, our method evolves neural
networks directly from raw pixel data, circumventing the need for explicit
game-state information. To facilitate this approach, we introduce the Dark
Souls API (DSAPI), a novel Python framework leveraging real-time computer
vision techniques for extracting critical game metrics, including player and
enemy health states. Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for
defeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined
behaviors or domain-specific heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that
evolved agents achieve up to a 35% success rate, indicating the viability of
neuroevolution in addressing complex, visually intricate gameplay scenarios.
This work represents an interesting application of vision-based neuroevolution,
highlighting its potential use in a wide range of challenging game environments
lacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agent-based framework using LLMs reconstructs tacit knowledge in organizations via iterative interactions, achieving 94.9% recall without direct specialist access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in documenting tacit knowledge due to incomplete information, hierarchical complexities, and identifying knowledgeable individuals.

Method: Agent-based framework with LLMs, modeled as an SI process with waning infectivity, tested in 864 simulations across synthetic company structures.

Result: 94.9% full-knowledge recall; self-critical feedback correlates with external scores; recovers knowledge without direct specialist access.

Conclusion: The framework effectively navigates organizational complexity and captures fragmented, otherwise inaccessible knowledge.

Abstract: Documenting tacit knowledge in organizations can be a challenging task due to
incomplete initial information, difficulty in identifying knowledgeable
individuals, the interplay of formal hierarchies and informal networks, and the
need to ask the right questions. To address this, we propose an agent-based
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reconstruct
dataset descriptions through interactions with employees. Modeling knowledge
dissemination as a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) process with waning infectivity,
we conduct 864 simulations across various synthetic company structures and
different dissemination parameters. Our results show that the agent achieves
94.9% full-knowledge recall, with self-critical feedback scores strongly
correlating with external literature critic scores. We analyze how each
simulation parameter affects the knowledge retrieval process for the agent. In
particular, we find that our approach is able to recover information without
needing to access directly the only domain specialist. These findings highlight
the agent's ability to navigate organizational complexity and capture
fragmented knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RELRaE, a framework using LLMs to translate XML data from lab experiments into a knowledge graph by enriching the XML schema for ontology creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interoperability of XML data between labs by converting it into a knowledge graph.

Method: Uses the RELRaE framework with LLMs to extract and label relationships in XML schemas, then evaluates the accuracy of these labels.

Result: Demonstrates LLMs can effectively generate relationship labels for ontology creation in lab automation.

Conclusion: LLMs are valuable for semi-automatic ontology generation, particularly in lab automation contexts.

Abstract: A large volume of XML data is produced in experiments carried out by robots
in laboratories. In order to support the interoperability of data between labs,
there is a motivation to translate the XML data into a knowledge graph. A key
stage of this process is the enrichment of the XML schema to lay the foundation
of an ontology schema. To achieve this, we present the RELRaE framework, a
framework that employs large language models in different stages to extract and
accurately label the relationships implicitly present in the XML schema. We
investigate the capability of LLMs to accurately generate these labels and then
evaluate them. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively used to
support the generation of relationship labels in the context of lab automation,
and that they can play a valuable role within semi-automatic ontology
generation frameworks more generally.

### [38] [Economic Evaluation of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03834)
*Michael J. Zellinger,Matt Thomson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an economic evaluation framework to compare LLMs by quantifying performance trade-offs in dollars, finding reasoning models outperform others when mistake costs exceed $0.01.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a method to compare LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses, such as cost vs. accuracy.

Method: Develop a framework to quantify LLM performance trade-offs in economic terms (cost of mistakes, latency, and abstaining). Apply this to compare reasoning and non-reasoning models on the MATH benchmark.

Result: Reasoning models offer better accuracy-cost trade-offs when mistake costs exceed $0.01. Single large LLMs outperform cascades if mistake costs are as low as $0.1.

Conclusion: Practitioners should prioritize powerful models over cost minimization, as deployment costs are outweighed by the economic impact of errors.

Abstract: Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto
frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no
way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for
example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address
this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the
performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic
constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of
making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining
from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the
performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from
the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better
accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds
\$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades
when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings
suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models,
practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather
than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely
dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Uni-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, enhances AI-facilitated teaching by dynamically matching query-style prototypes with a Prompt Bank and integrating a compact language model for natural content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval systems lack the ability to handle diverse and ambiguous educational queries, limiting effective learning experiences.

Method: Develops Uni-Retrieval, a multi-modal module with a Prompt Bank and MoE-LoRA, and integrates it with a language model to form Uni-RAG for retrieval and generation.

Result: Uni-RAG outperforms baseline systems in retrieval accuracy and generation quality while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Uni-RAG offers a scalable, pedagogically grounded solution for personalized and explainable learning assistance in STEM education.

Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret
abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible
learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus
on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity
and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this
limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval
module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and
dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank.
This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a
Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to
enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test
time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate
the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model,
forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given
a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational
materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or
instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results
on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline
retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality,
while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable,
pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging
retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient
learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.

*Rahil P Mehta,Yashwanthi Anand,Manish Motwani,Sandhya Saisubramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIProbe is a black-box testing technique that distinguishes between agent errors (model/policy flaws) and environmental infeasibility by comparing agent performance to a planner's solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiating between agent errors and environmental infeasibility is challenging but crucial for reliable autonomous agent deployment.

Method: AIProbe uses Latin Hypercube sampling to generate diverse environmental configurations and tasks, then compares agent performance to a search-based planner's solution.

Result: AIProbe outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting total and unique errors.

Conclusion: AIProbe enhances the reliability of autonomous agents by accurately identifying error sources.

Abstract: When an autonomous agent behaves undesirably, including failure to complete a
task, it can be difficult to determine whether the behavior is due to a
systemic agent error, such as flaws in the model or policy, or an environment
error, where a task is inherently infeasible under a given environment
configuration, even for an ideal agent. As agents and their environments grow
more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but
critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box
testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable
agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training
flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse
environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying
configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each
generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By
comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies
whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to
unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that
AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both
total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of
autonomous agents.

*Alyssa Loo,Ellie Pavlick,Roman Feiman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that large language models (LLMs) offer a new perspective in the debate about neural networks as models of cognitive function, showing they match or outperform Bayesian probabilistic language of thought (pLoT) models in explaining human behavior on logical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the adequacy of neural networks, especially LLMs, in modeling abstract cognitive functions like language and logic, compared to traditional models like pLoT.

Method: Testing various LLMs on an experimental paradigm for rule induction over logical concepts, comparing their performance to pLoT models.

Result: LLMs fit human behavior as well as pLoT models and make qualitatively different predictions, suggesting they are not just implementing pLoT solutions.

Conclusion: LLMs may represent a novel theoretical account of human logical concepts, warranting further exploration in cognitive science.

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit
account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the
primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via
which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come
from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of
artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these
questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function,
such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural
networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --
represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an
existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules
formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging
empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior
as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),
which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same
task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions
about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to
complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere
implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs
may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations
and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future
work in cognitive science should engage.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first public dataset for slide-animation modeling, fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with LoRA, and achieves improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in metrics like BLEU-4 and ROUGE-L.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of native animation support in AI-driven slide-generation tools and the limitations of existing VLMs due to missing datasets and temporal-reasoning capabilities.

Method: Release a dataset of 12,000 triplets (descriptions, JSON files, videos) covering PowerPoint effects, and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with LoRA.

Result: The LoRA model improves BLEU-4 by ~60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and shows significant gains in CODA-detail, demonstrating reliable temporal reasoning.

Conclusion: The dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric provide a benchmark for future VLM-based dynamic slide generation research.

Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for
audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual
expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native
animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with
animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited
temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first
public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of
natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos,
collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we
fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent
improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our
Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action
coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set
of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and
shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank
adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond
synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric
provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based
dynamic slide generation.

*Mohimenul Kabir,Kuldeep S Meel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUS-ASP is an answer set programming-based framework for online enumeration of minimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes), leveraging ASP's efficiency to accelerate MUS enumeration and counting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the core reason for unsatisfiability in formulas is crucial, and MUSes provide a way to capture this. Current research focuses on enumerating or counting MUSes.

Method: The paper introduces MUS-ASP, translating MUS enumeration into answer set solving to utilize ASP's computational efficiency.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows MUS-ASP's effectiveness, especially in accelerating MUS enumeration and counting when integrated with hybrid solvers.

Conclusion: MUS-ASP demonstrates the potential of ASP for efficient MUS enumeration and counting, offering a promising framework for future applications.

Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for
unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to
capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the
subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research
broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible
within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a
given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named
MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for
its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for
specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into
answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of
state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in
both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within
hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.

### [45] [Toward Better Generalisation in Uncertainty Estimators: Leveraging Data-Agnostic Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03998)
*Thuy An Ha,Bao Quoc Vo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores combining data-agnostic features with hidden-state features to improve LLM uncertainty quantification, finding mixed results on generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate confident but incorrect responses, necessitating better uncertainty quantification to assess factual accuracy.

Method: Hybrid feature sets (data-agnostic + hidden-state features) are tested for out-of-domain performance, with analysis of feature importance.

Result: Mixed outcomes: data-agnostic features sometimes improve generalizability but can degrade performance; hidden-state feature selection also yields inconsistent results.

Conclusion: The inconclusive results suggest probes may underweight data-agnostic features, highlighting the need for further investigation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually
incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for
end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce
answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.
Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality
of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among
these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown
particular promise, as these internal representations encode information
relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this
paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often
struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To
address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with
hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances
out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most
informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,
enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The
experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features
generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain
scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when
retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic
features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using
the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some
specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features
relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why
the results are inconclusive.

their respective strengths and introduce Lyria, a general LLM-driven genetic
algorithm framework, comprising 7 essential components. Through conducting
extensive experiments with 4 LLMs across 3 types of problems, we demonstrated
the efficacy of Lyria. Additionally, with 7 additional ablation experiments, we
further systematically analyzed and elucidated the factors that affect its

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between static benchmarks and dynamic real-world legal practice to advance legal intelligence.

Method: Introduce J1-ENVS (interactive legal environment) and J1-EVAL (evaluation framework) with six scenarios across three complexity levels. Test 17 LLM agents.

Result: Models show strong legal knowledge but poor procedural execution in dynamic settings. GPT-4o scores below 60%.

Conclusion: Dynamic legal intelligence remains challenging, highlighting the need for further research.

Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal
practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we
introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored
for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative
scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental
complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework,
designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across
varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents
reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle
with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o,
falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent
challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights
to guide future research.

TL;DR: The paper addresses compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training, proposing a two-stage pipeline (SFT + RL) that outperforms single methods and reduces compute costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between closed-source and open-source LLM-based web agents, due to challenges like narrow task focus and high compute costs.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a smaller model to imitate a larger one, followed by on-policy reinforcement learning (RL). Hyperparameters are optimized via bootstrapping.

Result: Combining SFT and RL outperforms either method alone, reduces compute costs by 45%, and closes the gap with closed-source models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach efficiently balances compute and performance, advancing open-source LLM web agents.

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it
has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source
alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a
narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step
web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train
LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically
grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our
approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate
a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy
reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter
choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive
trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to
estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with
on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena
and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match
the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the
compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close
the gap with closed-source models.

challenges in instruction following, ethical alignment, and reasoning
capabilities. This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration
of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), Q-Learning, and Actor-Critic methods. Additionally,
it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically
tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF), as well as advanced

present a comparative taxonomy based on reward modeling, feedback mechanisms,
and optimization strategies. Our evaluation highlights key trends. RLHF remains
dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly
improves stepwise reasoning. However, persistent challenges such as reward
hacking, computational costs, and scalable feedback collection underscore the
need for continued innovation. We further discuss emerging directions,
including hybrid RL algorithms, verifier-guided training, and multi-objective

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explains the WSD learning rate schedule in LLM training using the Mpemba effect, proposing an optimal plateau rate for faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a mechanistic explanation for the empirical WSD learning rate schedule and optimize it using thermodynamic principles.

Method: Analyzes training dynamics via the Mpemba effect, focusing on 'valley-river' loss landscapes and deriving conditions for an optimal plateau learning rate.

Result: Identifies the 'strong Mpemba point' as the optimal plateau rate, enabling faster convergence during decay.

Conclusion: The study offers a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and guidance for tuning learning rates in LLMs.

Abstract: Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often
follow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay
(WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains
underexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely
heuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic
analogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools
faster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class
of "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate
quickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba
effect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and
motivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss
decrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists
an optimal plateau learning rate - the "strong Mpemba point" - at which the
slowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase.
We derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics
required to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer
a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance
for tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have not been applied to clustering despite their success in generative tasks. CLUDI aims to bridge this gap.

Method: CLUDI combines diffusion models with Vision Transformer features, using a teacher-student paradigm with stochastic diffusion-based sampling for diverse cluster assignments.

Result: CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised classification, demonstrating robustness and adaptability to complex data.

Conclusion: CLUDI sets new benchmarks in clustering by leveraging diffusion models and Vision Transformer features effectively.

Abstract: Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks,
have not yet been applied to clustering. We introduce Clustering via Diffusion
(CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of
diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust
and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the
teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster
assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This
stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to
uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on
challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in
clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tightly integrate ASP and SMT, leveraging their strengths for handling both discrete and continuous changes, and to enhance action language C+ for broader applicability.

Method: Proposes ASPMT by fixing interpretations of background theories, translating tight ASPMT programs to SMT instances, and reformulating C+ semantics in ASPMT terms.

Result: Demonstrates SMT solvers can compute C+ language and represent cumulative effects on continuous resources.

Conclusion: ASPMT effectively bridges ASP and SMT, extending C+ for continuous changes and enabling SMT-based computation.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is a new framework of tight
integration of answer set programming (ASP) and satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT). Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is
based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing
interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship
between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT
instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language
C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the
semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to
compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative
effects on continuous resources.

### [54] [SmartThinker: Learning to Compress and Preserve Reasoning by Step-Level Length Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04348)
*Xingyang He,Xiao Ling,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SmartThinker is a two-stage framework for fine-grained control over reasoning chain lengths, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods penalize overall reasoning chain length, leading to suboptimal compression of critical steps and inefficiency.

Method: SmartThinker uses rejection sampling and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in stage one, and Step-Level Length Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) in stage two for differentiated length control.

Result: SmartThinker reduces redundancy while maintaining or improving performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning
capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also
introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning
processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has
attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated
samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more
concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty
often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while
preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained
control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each
individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a
short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length
Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,
which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while
reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core
components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward
function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a
difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components
enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.
Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone
models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning
while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebSynthesis addresses challenges in web agent training by simulating environments for scalable, cost-effective trajectory synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming uncontrollable environment states and high API costs in training web agents.

Method: Uses a learned world model for virtual web simulation and tree-based planning to generate diverse trajectories.

Result: Agents trained with WebSynthesis perform comparably or better than those trained on large real-world datasets.

Conclusion: WebSynthesis enables scalable and efficient self-improvement for web agents.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating
complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced
trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed
self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from
real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches
encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where
real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic
feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and
(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can
involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and
computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable
self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for
trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model
to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform
efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the
large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are
subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results
demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic
dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models
trained on large-scale real-world data.

### [56] [DC-Mamber: A Dual Channel Prediction Model based on Mamba and Linear Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04381)
*Bing Fan,Shusen Ma,Yun-Bo Zhao,Yu Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DC-Mamber combines Mamba and linear Transformer for multivariate time series forecasting, addressing limitations of each by using dual channels for local and global dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models (Transformer and Mamba) have limitations: Transformers struggle with local patterns and computational complexity, while Mamba lacks global context aggregation.

Method: DC-Mamber uses a Mamba-based channel for intra-variable features (channel-independent) and a Transformer-based channel for global dependencies (channel-mixing), fused for prediction.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets show DC-Mamber outperforms existing models in accuracy.

Conclusion: DC-Mamber effectively balances local and global dependencies, offering superior forecasting performance.

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for
processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and
channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as
a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,
while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each
time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current
mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.
Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and
suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in
long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models
(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but
struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome
the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel
forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series
forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a
channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the
Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model
cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two
distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These
representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a
temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion
layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive
experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over
existing models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A token-aware, layer-localized contrastive decoding method improves factual generation in LLMs by aligning token types with influential transformer layers, without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce factual errors, limiting reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing methods overlook joint dynamics between token-level and layer-level signals.

Method: The method identifies and suppresses attention to specific token types (e.g., punctuation in early layers, conceptual tokens in intermediate layers) to derive contrastive signals for factual decoding.

Result: The approach consistently improves factuality across multiple LLMs and benchmarks without requiring extra training or model changes.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances factual accuracy in LLMs by leveraging token-layer dynamics, offering a practical solution for knowledge-intensive applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and
generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability
in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a
promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat
token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint
dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware,
layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types
with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation.
Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation
tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens
govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing
attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the
induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to
guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or
model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance historical medications and new drugs for changing patient conditions.

Method: ARMR uses piecewise temporal learning and an adaptively responsive mechanism to dynamically adjust attention to drugs.

Result: ARMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets.

Conclusion: ARMR provides more personalized and accurate medication recommendations, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task in healthcare, especially for
patients with complex medical conditions. However, existing methods often
struggle to effectively balance the reuse of historical medications with the
introduction of new drugs in response to the changing patient conditions. In
order to address this challenge, we propose an Adaptively Responsive network
for Medication Recommendation (ARMR), a new method which incorporates 1) a
piecewise temporal learning component that distinguishes between recent and
distant patient history, enabling more nuanced temporal understanding, and 2)
an adaptively responsive mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention to new
and existing drugs based on the patient's current health state and medication
history. Experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets indicate that ARMR
has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in
different evaluation metrics, which contributes to more personalized and
accurate medication recommendations. The source code is publicly avaiable at:

Motivation: Errors in medical decision-making can be life-threatening; hybrid frameworks offer a practical solution.

Method: Uses a Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy with LLMs to generate clinical guidance from raw records.

Conclusion: MedGellan demonstrates the potential of hybrid frameworks in enhancing medical decision-making.

Abstract: Medical decision-making is a critical task, where errors can result in
serious, potentially life-threatening consequences. While full automation
remains challenging, hybrid frameworks that combine machine intelligence with
human oversight offer a practical alternative. In this paper, we present
MedGellan, a lightweight, annotation-free framework that uses a Large Language

then used by a physician to predict diagnoses. MedGellan uses a
Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy that respects the temporal order of
clinical data. Preliminary experiments show that the guidance generated by the
LLM with MedGellan improves diagnostic performance, particularly in recall and
$F_1$ score.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper uses linguistic analysis to study spontaneous thoughts like Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories, and Unexpected Thoughts, revealing their distinct linguistic patterns and aligning with existing theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore spontaneous thoughts (Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories, Unexpected Thoughts) through linguistic signatures, providing deeper insights into their cognitive and emotional underpinnings.

Method: Analyzing linguistic patterns in participant-generated descriptions of spontaneous thoughts to identify inherent characteristics.

Result: Deja Vu is linked to abstract/spatial language, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories to personal/emotional detail, and Unexpected Thoughts to unpredictability/cognitive disruption.

Conclusion: Language serves as a valuable tool to understand and reaffirm theories about spontaneous cognitive states.

Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions
between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are
studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers,
phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic
signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and
Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of
the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought
types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous
cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and
reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is
a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language,
Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally
significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and
cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to
reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest
through expression.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes TRAP, an IRL-based anomaly detection framework for AVs, improving robustness and generalization over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods in AVs struggle with unseen scenarios, noise, and occlusions, requiring large annotated datasets.

Method: Uses Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer driving intentions, with Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP) for noise robustness and generalization.

Result: Achieves 0.90 AUC and 82.2% F1-score, outperforming baselines by 39% Recall and 12% F1-score.

Conclusion: TRAP offers robust, early anomaly detection with strong performance and generalization, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by
identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise
safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely
on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced
efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions,
leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods
require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To
address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential
perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present
Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework
for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods:
noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is
implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case
supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to
maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior
deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score -
outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\%
on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved
while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen
anomaly types. Our code will be available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Monty, the first implementation of a thousand-brains system, highlighting its advantages in 3D object perception, rapid inference, and continual learning compared to traditional AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between biological and artificial intelligence by mimicking the architecture of cortical columns, aiming for rapid, continual learning and efficient generalization.

Method: Monty is tested on 3D object perception tasks using the YCB dataset, focusing on sensorimotor learning, model-free/model-based policies, and associative binding for learning.

Result: Monty demonstrates robust generalization, efficient inference via modular communication, and rapid, continual learning, outperforming traditional deep learning methods.

Conclusion: Thousand-brains systems, exemplified by Monty, show promise as a novel AI approach, though further development is needed.

Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they
lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual
learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured
knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests
that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a
semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical
column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial
intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the
architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first
implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,
and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.
Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of
sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these
enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on
classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to
detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and
model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled
movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,
a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further
accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine
Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,
and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to
current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of
development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and
promising new approach to AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Rec-APC model for privacy-aware recommender systems, addressing challenges in personalization with limited user data. It proves optimal policies converge to exploitation and outperforms POMDP solvers like SARSOP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent regulatory and technological shifts limit access to individual user data, posing challenges in personalization while avoiding user churn due to poor recommendations.

Method: The Rec-APC model uses Bayesian updates for feedback (binary responses) and a branch-and-bound algorithm to compute optimal policies.

Result: Optimal policies converge to exploitation, and the method outperforms SARSOP, especially with many user types or content categories.

Conclusion: The approach improves decision-making under aggregated preference constraints, offering practical solutions for privacy-aware RSs.

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem motivated by recent regulatory
and technological shifts that limit access to individual user data in
recommender systems (RSs), leaving only population-level preference
information. This privacy-aware setting poses fundamental challenges in
planning under uncertainty: Effective personalization requires exploration to
infer user preferences, yet unsatisfactory recommendations risk immediate user
churn. To address this, we introduce the Rec-APC model, in which an anonymous
user is drawn from a known prior over latent user types (e.g., personas or
clusters), and the decision-maker sequentially selects items to recommend.
Feedback is binary -- positive responses refine the posterior via Bayesian
updates, while negative responses result in the termination of the session.
  We prove that optimal policies converge to pure exploitation in finite time
and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to efficiently compute them.
Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens data confirm rapid convergence and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the POMDP solver SARSOP, particularly
when the number of user types is large or comparable to the number of content
categories. Our results highlight the applicability of this approach and
inspire new ways to improve decision-making under the constraints imposed by
aggregated preference data.

*Sonal Allana,Rozita Dara,Xiaodong Lin,Pulei Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as defenses against privacy leaks in Explainable AI (XAI), evaluating three PETs to mitigate attribute inference attacks while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of defenses against privacy attacks exploiting XAI explanations, which leak sensitive personal information.

Method: Empirically evaluate three PETs (synthetic training data, differentially private training, noise addition) on feature-based XAI methods.

Result: PETs reduced attack risk by up to 49.47% while preserving model utility and explanation quality.

Conclusion: PETs can effectively mitigate privacy attacks in XAI, with strategies identified for maximizing benefits and minimizing risks.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a crucial pathway in mitigating
the risk of non-transparency in the decision-making process of black-box
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, despite the benefits, XAI
methods are found to leak the privacy of individuals whose data is used in
training or querying the models. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks
that exploit explanations to infer sensitive personal information of
individuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy
attacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and
machine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we
explore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against
attribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We
empirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data,
differentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of
feature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the
mitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as
utility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations
reduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and
explanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using
PETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy
attack on sensitive personal information.

*Niloofar Shadab,Tyler Cody,Alejandro Salado,Taylan G. Topcu,Mohammad Shadab,Peter Beling*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional engineering methodologies for intelligent systems and introduces 'core and periphery' principles as a new framework, supported by empirical evidence and mathematical definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional engineering principles fail to address the scaling of intelligence in systems, necessitating new overarching principles.

Method: Introduces 'core and periphery' principles, rooted in abstract systems theory and the Law of Requisite Variety, and validates them empirically.

Result: Demonstrates applicability to biological and artificial intelligence systems, and mathematically defines core-dominant vs periphery-dominant systems.

Conclusion: The 'core and periphery' framework bridges abstract theory with practical implementation, offering a fresh approach to engineering general intelligence.

Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles
of decomposition and recomposition. These principles involve partitioning
inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of
individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does
not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the
scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that
the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching
systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery"
principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and
the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract
concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate
their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems,
bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on
our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs
periphery-dominant systems.

### [66] [DisMS-TS: Eliminating Redundant Multi-Scale Features for Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04600)
*Zhipeng Liu,Peibo Duan,Binwu Wang,Xuan Tang,Qi Chu,Changsheng Zhang,Yongsheng Huang,Bin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DisMS-TS is a novel framework for time series classification that disentangles scale-shared and scale-specific features to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-scale methods fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features, leading to over- or under-focusing on these features.

Method: Proposes a temporal disentanglement module and two regularization terms to separate and learn scale-shared and scale-specific representations.

Result: DisMS-TS outperforms baselines with accuracy improvements up to 9.71%.

Conclusion: DisMS-TS effectively addresses redundancy in multi-scale features, enhancing time series classification performance.

Abstract: Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making
the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements
have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which
provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns.
However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods
fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time
series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared
features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled
Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea
of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time
series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a
temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific
temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both
scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two
regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared
representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all
temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate
the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy
improvement up to 9.71%.

### [67] [Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning of Reasoning Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04632)
*Yun Qu,Qi Cheems Wang,Yixiu Mao,Vincent Tao Hu,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoPPS is a Bayesian framework for efficient prompt selection in RL finetuning of LLMs, reducing computational costs by avoiding frequent LLM interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs in RL finetuning of LLMs due to frequent prompt evaluations and policy updates.

Method: MoPPS models prompt success rates as latent variables, uses streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a multi-armed bandit setup.

Result: MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with fewer LLM rollouts.

Conclusion: MoPPS offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional evaluate-then-select methods for prompt selection in LLM finetuning.

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to
achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to
the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and
repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce
iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the
pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for
optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent
LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select
schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary
prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian
risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without
requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's
success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and
employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine,
enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments
across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS
reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly
reduced LLM rollouts.

### [68] [Trojan Horse Prompting: Jailbreaking Conversational Multimodal Models by Forging Assistant Message](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04673)
*Wei Duan,Li Qian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Trojan Horse Prompting exploits conversational AI's trust in its own history to bypass safety mechanisms, achieving higher attack success than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover vulnerabilities in conversational AI systems that rely on dialogue history, revealing flaws in safety alignment.

Method: Introduces Trojan Horse Prompting, where adversaries forge past utterances to inject malicious payloads and trigger harmful outputs.

Result: Higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) compared to established jailbreaking methods, demonstrated on Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation.

Conclusion: Exposes a fundamental flaw in AI security, advocating for protocol-level validation over input-level filtering.

Abstract: The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by
leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance
introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse
Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by
forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history
provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed
message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content
generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models
are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable
skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit
trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental
validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan
Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than
established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental
flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from
input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational
context integrity.

### [70] [LumiCRS: Asymmetric Contrastive Prototype Learning for Long-Tail Conversational Movie Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04722)
*Jinzhi Wang,Bin Li,Qingke Peng,Haozhou Li,Zeyuan Zeng,Ruimeng Li,Biyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LumiCRS addresses long-tail imbalance in conversational recommender systems (CRSs) with adaptive loss, prototype learning, and GPT-4o-driven augmentation, improving accuracy, diversity, and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CRSs suffer from long-tail data imbalance, causing bias toward popular items and neglecting diversity. This leads to head over-fitting, body drift, and tail sparsity.

Method: LumiCRS uses three layers: (1) Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss (ACFL) to adjust class weights, (2) Prototype Learning for clustering, and (3) GPT-4o-driven dialogue augmentation for tail sparsity.

Result: LumiCRS improves Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% on REDIAL and INSPIRED benchmarks, with human evaluations confirming better fluency and relevance.

Conclusion: Multi-layer collaboration in LumiCRS effectively mitigates long-tail imbalance, enhancing fairness and performance in CRSs.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme
long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward
head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the
cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL
corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all
mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.
This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body
representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose
LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through
three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss
(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head
over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail
Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to
guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a
GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically
generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity
and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly
improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and
INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over
fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,
informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair
long-tail conversational recommender.

### [71] [ChipSeek-R1: Generating Human-Surpassing RTL with LLM via Hierarchical Reward-Driven Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04736)
*Zhirong Chen,Kaiyan Chang,Zhuolin Li,Xinyang He,Chujie Chen,Cangyuan Li,Mengdi Wang,Haobo Xu,Yinhe Han,Ying Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChipSeek-R1 uses hierarchical reinforcement learning to train LLMs for generating RTL code that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized, outperforming human-written designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches for RTL code generation struggle to balance functional correctness and hardware quality (PPA), lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles.

Method: ChipSeek-R1 employs a hierarchical reward system integrating syntax, functional correctness, and PPA feedback during reinforcement learning.

Result: ChipSeek-R1 achieves state-of-the-art functional correctness and generates 27 RTL designs surpassing human-written PPA metrics on the RTLLM benchmark.

Conclusion: Integrating toolchain feedback via reinforcement learning enables automated generation of human-surpassing RTL code, demonstrating significant potential for LLMs in hardware design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face
a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional
correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods
based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but
PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In
contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after
generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without
updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic
design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven
reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that
achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1
employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on
syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from
synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn
complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code
that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on
standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results
in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1
generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original
human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating
toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for
reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL
code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.

*Seyedarmin Azizi,Erfan Baghaei Potraghloo,Massoud Pedram*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Activation-Steered Compression (ASC) reduces verbose reasoning in LLMs by steering activations toward concise reasoning, achieving significant length reduction without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verbose reasoning in LLMs wastes context, increases latency, and consumes more energy. ASC aims to compress reasoning traces efficiently.

Method: ASC modifies hidden representations using a steering vector derived from activation space analysis, without retraining.

Result: ASC reduces reasoning length by up to 67.43% while maintaining accuracy, with a 2.73x speedup in reasoning time.

Conclusion: ASC is a practical, training-free method for optimizing LLM reasoning in latency- or cost-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include
intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these
rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to
wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe
that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct
regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and
injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can
reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively
compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as
Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens
reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we
provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,
derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate
steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC
achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,
while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a
training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on
MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock
time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for
streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or
cost-sensitive settings. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving interactivity with HVAC systems for non-expert users by enabling accurate, real-time, and context-aware QA interfaces.

Method: JARVIS uses an Expert-LLM for query translation and an Agent for SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and response generation. It includes adaptive context injection, parameterized SQL building, and bottom-up planning.

Result: JARVIS outperforms baseline methods in automated and user-centered assessments, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: JARVIS effectively addresses HVAC-specific QA challenges, providing accurate and interpretable responses for diverse queries.

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs)
present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system
insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate,
real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique
challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data,
domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In
this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for
sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to
translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and
an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and
final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS
integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and
deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder
and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning
scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We
evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system
and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its
effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse
queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and
ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving
high response quality and accuracy.

Result: FurniMAS outperforms baselines in generating high-quality 3D decor.

Conclusion: FurniMAS effectively automates furniture decoration, meeting functional, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences.

Abstract: Furniture decoration is an important task in various industrial applications.
However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and
requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore
how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We
propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration.
Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a
working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with
appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the
decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences.
FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each
fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents
collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to
transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in
generating high-quality 3D decor.

TL;DR: LLMs are viable for traffic incident impact prediction, matching traditional ML models without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' feasibility for traffic incident impact forecasting, leveraging their advantages like minimal training data needs and free-text utilization.

Method: Proposed an LLM-based solution combining traffic and LLM-extracted features, with effective example selection for in-context learning. Evaluated three LLMs and two ML models on real traffic data.

Result: Best-performing LLM matched the accuracy of top ML models, despite no task-specific training.

Conclusion: LLMs are a practical option for traffic incident impact prediction.

Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of applying large language models (LLMs)
for forecasting the impact of traffic incidents on the traffic flow. The use of
LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based
solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to
utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that
predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and
LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an
effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We
evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art
machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show
that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine
learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction
task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for
traffic incident impact prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with multi-turn dialogues and proactive questioning in medical applications, limiting their practical use in TCM diagnosis.

Method: DoPI uses a collaborative architecture with a guidance model for dynamic questioning and an expert model for diagnoses, trained on a multi-turn dialogue dataset.

Result: DoPI achieves 84.68% accuracy in interrogation outcomes, improving diagnostic communication while maintaining expertise.

Conclusion: The DoPI system effectively addresses LLM limitations in TCM, enhancing diagnostic capabilities through structured dialogues and expert knowledge.

Abstract: Enhancing interrogation capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
diagnosis through multi-turn dialogues and knowledge graphs presents a
significant challenge for modern AI systems. Current large language models
(LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical
applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and
proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application
and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address
these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed
for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture
comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts
multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on
a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information.
Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final
diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn
doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios
and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually
collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI
system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes,
significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis
while maintaining professional expertise.

Motivation: To improve AA-CBR by eliminating spikes without sacrificing model properties.

Method: Uses debates where past cases argue for their labels, attacking or supporting others.

Abstract: We introduce Supported Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning
(sAA-CBR), a binary classification model in which past cases engage in debates
by arguing in favour of their labelling and attacking or supporting those with
opposing or agreeing labels. With supports, sAA-CBR overcomes the limitation of
its precursor AA-CBR, which can contain extraneous cases (or spikes) that are

*Maxence Boels,Harry Robertshaw,Alejandro Granados,Prokar Dasgupta,Sebastien Ourselin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) for surgical action planning, finding IL outperforms RL variants on the CholecT50 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether RL can outperform IL in surgical action planning, given RL's potential to discover superior strategies through exploration.

Method: Evaluated a Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation Learning (DARIL) baseline and three RL variants: world model-based RL, direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement.

Result: DARIL achieved higher mAP scores (34.6% action triplet recognition, 33.6% next frame prediction) than RL variants, which underperformed (e.g., world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s).

Conclusion: IL outperforms RL in surgical action planning, challenging assumptions about RL's superiority in sequential decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target
triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides
natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement
learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through
exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for
surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation
Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and
33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at
10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,
direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches
underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while
direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution
matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over
potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This
challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and
provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

### [79] [How Rules Represent Causal Knowledge: Causal Modeling with Abductive Logic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05088)
*Kilian Rückschloß,Felix Weitkämper*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends Pearl's causal framework to stratified abductive logic programs, providing a causal interpretation of stable models and aligning them with key philosophical principles of causation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge causal knowledge and descriptive knowledge by applying Pearl's causality concepts to logic programs, enabling principled reasoning about interventions.

Method: Extends Pearl's approach to causality by translating abductive logic programs into causal systems, leveraging stable model semantics.

Result: Stable models of stratified programs align with philosophical principles like causal sufficiency and natural necessity, validating their use for causal modeling.

Conclusion: Stratified abductive logic programs are a justified framework for causal modeling and predicting intervention effects.

Abstract: Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of
interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits
drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to
causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic
programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal
interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by
Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive
logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal
reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about
external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics
for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation,
such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved
effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a
framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions

### [80] [Rule Learning for Knowledge Graph Reasoning under Agnostic Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05110)
*Shixuan Liu,Yue He,Yunfei Wang,Hao Zou,Haoxiang Cheng,Wenjing Yang,Peng Cui,Zhong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces StableRule, a framework for out-of-distribution (OOD) KG reasoning, addressing biases and distribution shifts to improve robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG reasoning methods rely on the I.I.D assumption, which fails under unknown biases or distribution shifts, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes StableRule, combining feature decorrelation and rule learning to enhance OOD generalization.

Result: StableRule outperforms benchmarks on seven KGs, showing robustness in diverse environments.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses OOD KG reasoning, offering practical benefits for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning remains a critical research area focused on
inferring missing knowledge by analyzing relationships among observed facts.
Despite its success, a key limitation of existing KG reasoning methods is their
dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due
to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution
shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and
reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments,
this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown
selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution
shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG
reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose
the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that
integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD
generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule
framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD
scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in
effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across
diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GIST is a cross-domain lifelong sequence model addressing data sparsity and cold start in CTR prediction by decoupling source and target domain training, using a novel Content-Behavior Joint Training Module and Asymmetric Similarity Integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with joint training and fine-tuning for cross-domain CTR prediction, especially with non-overlapping user data and continuous new data integration.

Method: Proposes GIST with a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT) for stable representation and Asymmetric Similarity Integration (ASI) for enhanced knowledge transfer.

Result: GIST outperforms SOTA methods in offline evaluations and online A/B tests, improving ad system performance on Xiaohongshu.

Conclusion: GIST effectively addresses cross-domain CTR challenges, enhancing scalability and performance in real-world industrial settings.

Abstract: Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity
and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring
knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on
overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training
or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target
domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles
to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training
with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To
address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model
that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike
previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using
only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively
introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns
content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to
facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric
Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through
similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
GIST, surpassing SOTA methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test.
Deployed on the Xiaohongshu (RedNote) platform, GIST effectively enhances
online ads system performance at scale, serving hundreds of millions of daily
active users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in healthcare AI development, such as diverse data, complex tasks, and privacy, by creating foundation models requiring less task-specific tuning.

Method: Developed MedGemma, based on Gemma 3, and MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder, to enhance medical understanding and reasoning.

Result: Achieved 2.6-18.1% improvements in medical tasks, reduced EHR retrieval errors by 50%, and matched state-of-the-art performance in specialized tasks.

Conclusion: MedGemma provides a robust foundation for medical AI, accelerating research and downstream applications.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare
applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to
healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy.
Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less
task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of
healthcare AI applications. We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical
vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma
demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text,
significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and
approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the
general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks,
MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering,
15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8%
improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning
MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in
electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable
performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax
classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally
introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP.
MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an
encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical
image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong
foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to
significantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate scientific discovery by developing AI agents that understand human knowledge frontiers, using HLE as a benchmark.

Method: Introduces X-Master, a flexible reasoning agent interacting with external tools, and X-Masters, a workflow to scale reasoning capabilities.

Result: X-Masters achieves 32.1% on HLE, surpassing competitors and exceeding the 30% threshold for the first time.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of complex task-solving and provides insights for future AI model training.

Abstract: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of
leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal
requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such,
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for
evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the
foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the
capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce
X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human
researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning
process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction
language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized
tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through
X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically
enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters,
sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing
OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to
exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of
complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future
advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

### [84] [When Chain of Thought is Necessary, Language Models Struggle to Evade Monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05246)
*Scott Emmons,Erik Jenner,David K. Elson,Rif A. Saurous,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Heng Chen,Irhum Shafkat,Rohin Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the reliability of chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in AI safety, distinguishing between CoT-as-rationalization and CoT-as-computation, and argues for monitorability over faithfulness in runtime monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent findings question the reliability of CoT monitoring, especially in post-hoc rationalization, prompting a need to redefine its role in preventing severe harm.

Method: Introduces a framework separating CoT-as-rationalization from CoT-as-computation, increases task difficulty to enforce reasoning exposure, and provides stress-testing guidelines.

Result: Models can obscure intentions but only with significant assistance, suggesting CoT monitoring is defensible but requires active protection.

Conclusion: CoT monitoring is a valuable defense layer but needs ongoing stress-testing and safeguards against evasion.

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense,
recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These
findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a
post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for
the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the
key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce
a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from
CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require
complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating
the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad
behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose
its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to
stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these
guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only
when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or
iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not
infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires
active protection and continued stress-testing.

*Abdulaziz Ahmed,Mohammed Al-Maamari,Mohammad Firouz,Dursun Delen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning framework for an e-triage tool in emergency departments, using metaheuristic optimization (SA, ASA) to enhance XGB and CaB models, with ASA-CaB achieving the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve patient triage in EDs by leveraging machine learning and optimizing hyperparameters for better accuracy.

Method: Uses retrospective ED data, applies feature selection, and optimizes XGB and CaB models with SA, ASA, and GS methods.

Result: ASA-CaB outperformed other models with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 scores around 83%.

Conclusion: The proposed ASA-CaB model is effective for e-triage, demonstrating superior performance in prioritizing ED patients.

Abstract: Patient triage at emergency departments (EDs) is necessary to prioritize care
for patients with critical and time-sensitive conditions. Different tools are
used for patient triage and one of the most common ones is the emergency
severity index (ESI), which has a scale of five levels, where level 1 is the
most urgent and level 5 is the least urgent. This paper proposes a framework
for utilizing machine learning to develop an e-triage tool that can be used at
EDs. A large retrospective dataset of ED patient visits is obtained from the
electronic health record of a healthcare provider in the Midwest of the US for
three years. However, the main challenge of using machine learning algorithms
is that most of them have many parameters and without optimizing these
parameters, developing a high-performance model is not possible. This paper
proposes an approach to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning. The
metaheuristic optimization algorithms simulated annealing (SA) and adaptive
simulated annealing (ASA) are proposed to optimize the parameters of extreme
gradient boosting (XGB) and categorical boosting (CaB). The newly proposed
algorithms are SA-XGB, ASA-XGB, SA-CaB, ASA-CaB. Grid search (GS), which is a
traditional approach used for machine learning fine-tunning is also used to
fine-tune the parameters of XGB and CaB, which are named GS-XGB and GS-CaB. The
six algorithms are trained and tested using eight data groups obtained from the
feature selection phase. The results show ASA-CaB outperformed all the proposed
algorithms with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 of 83.3%, 83.2%, 83.3%,
83.2%, respectively.

*Caylum Collier,Krishnendu Guha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight watchdog mechanism reduces energy consumption in AI-based energy theft detection by filtering inputs for an LSTM model, achieving 64% power savings with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy theft detection in smart grids using AI models is computationally expensive, especially in low-theft scenarios, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: Proposes a watchdog mechanism as a pre-filter to activate an LSTM model only for suspicious cases, reducing unnecessary computations.

Result: Simulations show over 64% power reduction with high recall and minimal accuracy loss across varying theft scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a scalable, energy-efficient approach for AI-assisted energy theft detection in smart grids.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids
worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance
in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works
exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high
computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in
low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy
usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,
designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed
to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve
energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing
energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed
system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying
theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power
consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy
and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more
energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart
grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve
marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment
considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results
highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring
systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.

Conclusion: The framework is extendable to other image-based diagnostics for regulatory-compliant fusion reactor control.

Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) has been promising for fusion control, its
inherent black-box nature will make compliant implementation in regulatory

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified diffusion framework is proposed for generating structured and spatial biological data, addressing limitations of existing models by incorporating hierarchical feature injection and channel-wise attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models fail to handle high-dimensional, spatially aligned biological data with complex inter-channel relationships, limiting their practical application.

Method: The framework introduces hierarchical feature injection for multi-resolution conditioning and combines latent-space and output-space channel-wise attention to capture inter-channel dependencies. Training involves random masking for flexible conditioning.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks like protein imputation and gene-to-protein prediction, with strong generalization to unseen conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of generative modeling for spatial biological data, offering improved performance and flexibility.

Abstract: Spatial profiling technologies in biology, such as imaging mass cytometry
(IMC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), generate high-dimensional,
multi-channel data with strong spatial alignment and complex inter-channel
relationships. Generative modeling of such data requires jointly capturing
intra- and inter-channel structure, while also generalizing across arbitrary
combinations of observed and missing channels for practical application.
Existing diffusion-based models generally assume low-dimensional inputs (e.g.,
RGB images) and rely on simple conditioning mechanisms that break spatial
correspondence and ignore inter-channel dependencies. This work proposes a
unified diffusion framework for controllable generation over structured and
spatial biological data. Our model contains two key innovations: (1) a
hierarchical feature injection mechanism that enables multi-resolution
conditioning on spatially aligned channels, and (2) a combination of
latent-space and output-space channel-wise attention to capture inter-channel
relationships. To support flexible conditioning and generalization to arbitrary
subsets of observed channels, we train the model using a random masking
strategy, enabling it to reconstruct missing channels from any combination of
inputs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across both spatial and
non-spatial prediction tasks, including protein imputation in IMC and
gene-to-protein prediction in single-cell datasets, and show strong
generalization to unseen conditional configurations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address food authenticity, mislabeling, and adulteration in beef.

Method: Portable NIRS collected spectral data; PCA and ML models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) analyzed patterns.

Result: Random Forest had highest accuracy (AUC 0.8826); SVM and LR balanced performance.

Conclusion: NIRS + ML is reliable for meat authenticity, aiding food fraud detection.

Abstract: This study evaluates the use of Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined
with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to differentiate Hanwoo beef
(HNB) and Holstein beef (HLB) to address food authenticity, mislabeling, and
adulteration. Rapid and non-invasive spectral data were attained by a portable
NIRS, recording absorbance data within the wavelength range of 700 to 1100 nm.
A total of 40 Longissimus lumborum samples, evenly split between HNB and HLB,
were obtained from a local hypermarket. Data analysis using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct spectral patterns associated with chemical
changes, clearly separating the two beef varieties and accounting for 93.72% of
the total variance. ML models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and
Neural Networks (NN), were implemented, optimized through hyperparameter
tuning, and validated by 5-fold cross-validation techniques to enhance model
robustness and prevent overfitting. Random Forest provided the highest
predictive accuracy with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 0.8826, closely followed by the SVM model at 0.8747.
Furthermore, GB and NN algorithms exhibited satisfactory performances, with
cross-validation scores of 0.752. Notably, the NN model achieved the highest
recall rate of 0.7804, highlighting its suitability in scenarios requiring
heightened sensitivity. DT and NB exhibited comparatively lower predictive
performance. The LR and SVM models emerged as optimal choices by effectively
balancing high accuracy, precision, and recall. This study confirms that
integrating NIRS with ML techniques offers a powerful and reliable method for
meat authenticity, significantly contributing to detecting food fraud.

Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of pre-trained large models in time series forecasting, an area less studied compared to other domains.

Method: Empirical analysis of SOTA pre-trained universal time series models (e.g., Moirai, TimeGPT) and conventional transformers across benchmarks.

Result: Pre-trained LSTSMs show strengths but also limitations, with scenarios where they outperform or remain comparable to simpler models.

Conclusion: Pre-training offers advantages in some cases, but simpler models can still be competitive, providing insights for model selection in time series tasks.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across

traditional non-pretrained small-scale transformers in forecasting tasks. We
analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained universal time series models (e.g.,
Moirai, TimeGPT) alongside conventional transformers, evaluating accuracy,
computational efficiency, and interpretability across multiple benchmarks. Our
findings reveal the strengths and limitations of pre-trained LSTSMs, providing

*Meimei Yang,Yongheng Sun,Qianqian Wang,Andrea Bozoki,Maureen Kohi,Mingxia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HKGF, a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion framework for analyzing neurocognitive decline using multimodal neuroimages, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fuse multimodal neuroimages in Euclidean space, failing to capture the hierarchical structure of brain networks. HKGF addresses this by leveraging hyperbolic space.

Method: HKGF includes multimodal graph construction, hyperbolic graph representation learning (HKGNNs), cross-modality coupling, and a hyperbolic neural network for predictions.

Result: Experiments with 4,000+ subjects show HKGF's superiority in neurocognitive decline prediction tasks.

Conclusion: HKGF effectively quantifies brain connectivity changes related to neurocognitive decline, offering a general framework for multimodal data analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain
activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain
regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps
detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are
generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture
intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks.
This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for
neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a
multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module
that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic
kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that
enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for
downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to
capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving
the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving
over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF
over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks.
HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating
objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes
associated with neurocognitive decline.

### [92] [Beyond Token Pruning: Operation Pruning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02909)
*Aoming Liu,Reuben Tan,Boqing Gong,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSOP is a data-driven method for pruning redundant operations in Vision Language Models (VLMs) while preserving critical ones, achieving efficient computation with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior token pruning methods conflate token and operation redundancy, removing critical operations with discarded tokens. GSOP aims to surgically eliminate only redundant operations.

Method: GSOP decomposes VLM decoder computations into atomic operations (token groups, layer positions, computation modules) and prunes them greedily based on minimal performance drop. It leverages historical rankings and excludes certain operations to enhance efficiency.

Result: GSOP reduces computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 18% across diverse VLMs and tasks.

Conclusion: GSOP offers a practical and efficient solution for operation pruning in VLMs, validated by real GPU evaluations.

Abstract: Prior Vision Language Model (VLM) token pruning reduces computation by
eliminating attention and feed-forward operations for pruned tokens while
maintaining all operations for critical tokens. However, this binary approach
conflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along
with discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant
operations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving
critical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a
data-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP
first decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along
three dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP
determines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP
iteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance
drop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets
can be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according
to this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency
through: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant
evaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune" and ``danger-to-prune"
operations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance
tradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while
maintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when
transferred across diverse VLMs and tasks. Real GPU efficiency evaluations
confirm its practical value. The code is in

*Geonwoo Cho,Jaegyun Im,Doyoon Kim,Sundong Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CP-DRL is a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that leverages causal relationships between tasks to improve structure-awareness and sample efficiency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in CRL is identifying tasks that balance exploration and transfer, requiring ground-truth causal structures, which are often unavailable.

Method: CP-DRL approximates Structural Causal Model (SCM) differences from interaction data, combining task novelty and learnability (reward gain) into a unified objective.

Result: CP-DRL outperforms existing methods on benchmarks (Point Mass, Bipedal Walker-Trivial, Infeasible variant) with faster convergence, higher returns, and reduced variance.

Conclusion: Leveraging causal relationships between tasks enhances curriculum reinforcement learning, as demonstrated by CP-DRL's superior performance.

Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement
learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on
intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote
exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent
approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),
the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic
assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM
differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal
captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured
by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms
existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster
convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with
comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves
the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results
indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the
structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning.
We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of
our main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compress HuBERT, a widely used SSL-based speech model, without relying on layer-wise or feature-wise mapping, simplifying the distillation process.

Method: Replaces the original HuBERT model with a student model, training it using the same SSL objective as HuBERT's pre-training, avoiding extra modules or constraints.

Result: DiceHuBERT improves phoneme recognition by 21% and ASR performance by 14%, outperforming existing methods on SUPERB benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiceHuBERT offers a simpler and more effective distillation approach, demonstrating competitive performance across multiple speech tasks.

Abstract: We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing
HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation
model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and
feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages
HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the
original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be
trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating
the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental
results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing
distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and
ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates
competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear
advantage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining DBSCAN clustering and Elastic Net regression to analyze multifactorial problems like carbon emissions, tested on China's energy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address structural complexity and multicollinearity in multifactorial problems, exemplified by carbon emissions analysis.

Method: Integrates DBSCAN for unsupervised clustering and Elastic Net for feature selection and regularization.

Result: Identified 16 emission categories from China's data, assessing drivers and characteristics, proving the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework is globally applicable for complex challenges like carbon emissions, emphasizing model accuracy over human-interpreted features.

Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering
with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems
characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by
carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to
objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for
high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is
specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and
regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it
particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this
framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019)
resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and
drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the
framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide
actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the
framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions,
and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be
accurate for the model.

*Jiong Yang,Yong Kiam Tan,Mate Soos,Magnus O. Myreen,Kuldeep S. Meel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable and trustworthy method for verifying Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs), achieving significant speedups and high certification rates compared to existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BNNs are crucial for safety-critical applications but existing verification methods lack scalability or soundness. This work aims to address these limitations.

Method: The approach uses a custom solver for qualitative reasoning and an approximate model counter for quantitative reasoning, with specialized proof generation and checking pipelines.

Result: Empirical results show a 9x speedup for qualitative verification and a 218x speedup for quantitative verification, with high certification rates (99% and 86%).

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves the scalability and trustworthiness of BNN verification, making it more applicable to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical
applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations.
Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron
is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for
safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities
of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain
compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with
model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN
analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness
errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both
qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a
native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for
qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative
reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking
pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring
trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a
BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified
solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and
PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$
speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our
pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the
qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is
in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only
$62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Echo State Transformers (EST) combine Transformer attention with Reservoir Computing to address quadratic complexity in Transformers, achieving constant computational complexity and outperforming GRUs, LSTMs, and Transformers in low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers and LLMs are inefficient for brain-like cognitive tasks and suffer from quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. EST aims to create efficient models with less reliance on intensive computation and massive data.

Method: EST integrates Transformer attention with Reservoir Computing, introducing a 'Working Memory' module with trained reservoir hyperparameters to dynamically adapt memory/non-linearity trade-offs.

Result: EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and Transformers on 8 of 12 tasks in the STREAM benchmark, showing superior performance in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: EST is an effective replacement for GRUs and LSTMs and complements standard Transformers in resource-constrained and low-data environments.

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are
remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a
diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore,
sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:
quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these
limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less
reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce
Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves
this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.
EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from
Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.
Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of
the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module
called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent
networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory
units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical
reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the
EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By
maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST
achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively
breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on
the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,
demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of
these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an
effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard
Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data
scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.

Conclusion: PlaceFM provides a scalable, adaptable solution for multi-scale geospatial analysis without pretraining.

Abstract: Spatial structure is central to effective geospatial intelligence systems.
While foundation models have shown promise, they often lack the flexibility to
reason about places, which are context-rich regions spanning different spatial
granularities. We propose PlaceFM, a spatial foundation model that captures
place representations using a training-free graph condensation method. PlaceFM
condenses a nationwide POI graph built from integrated Foursquare and
OpenStreetMap data in the U.S., generating general-purpose embeddings of
places. These embeddings can be seamlessly integrated into geolocation data
pipelines to support a wide range of downstream tasks. Without requiring
pretraining, PlaceFM offers a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-scale
geospatial analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning struggles with performance and transparency due to limited domain knowledge integration.

Method: Developed CMML, a method based on conceptual modeling constructs for data preparation, tested on real-world problems and evaluated by data scientists.

Result: CMML improved machine learning outcomes and was positively assessed by practitioners.

Conclusion: CMML effectively leverages domain knowledge to enhance machine learning data preparation and performance.

Abstract: Machine learning enables the extraction of useful information from large,
diverse datasets. However, despite many successful applications, machine
learning continues to suffer from performance and transparency issues. These
challenges can be partially attributed to the limited use of domain knowledge
by machine learning models. This research proposes using the domain knowledge
represented in conceptual models to improve the preparation of the data used to
train machine learning models. We develop and demonstrate a method, called the
Conceptual Modeling for Machine Learning (CMML), which is comprised of
guidelines for data preparation in machine learning and based on conceptual
modeling constructs and principles. To assess the impact of CMML on machine
learning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate
its impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data
scientists on the applicability of the method. These results demonstrate the
value of CMML for improving machine learning outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline and enhance computational drug discovery by integrating LLMs with domain-specific tools for tasks like data retrieval, molecular generation, and property prediction.

Method: Combines LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools for tasks such as biomedical data retrieval, molecular generation, property prediction, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation.

Result: Improved molecular refinement (e.g., QED > 0.6 molecules increased from 34 to 55) and generated 3D protein-ligand complexes with rapid binding affinity estimates.

Conclusion: The framework effectively supports molecular screening and prioritization, offering a scalable foundation for AI-assisted drug discovery.

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that
automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug
discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the
framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question
answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular
refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study
targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved
relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES
representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with
improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically
diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided
iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of
molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least
four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a
pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D
protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for
candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively
supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its
modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,
providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in capturing tacit, interpretive reasoning in molecular design by combining human expertise with AI.

Method: Uses ChatGPT to simulate chemist knowledge, fused with graph-based molecular features via gated cross-attention.

Result: Achieves 15.0% RMSE reduction on FreeSolv and 5.39% AUROC improvement on BACE.

Conclusion: MolProphecy enhances accuracy and interpretability, offering a flexible, collaborative approach for drug discovery.

Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to
integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models.
While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive
accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central
to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT
as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making.
The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM)
as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based
molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint
reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four
benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction
in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis
reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary
contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers
a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with
the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current
simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is
publicly available at https://github.com/zhangruochi/MolProphecy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reactive or time-based maintenance for vending machines is inefficient, leading to unplanned downtimes and high costs.

Method: The framework uses IoT sensors and ML algorithms to monitor components in real time and predict failures.

Result: Simulated tests showed improved early fault detection and fewer unnecessary service interventions.

Conclusion: Predictive maintenance can enhance vending machine operational efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of vending machines in public and commercial
environments has placed a growing emphasis on operational efficiency and
customer satisfaction. Traditional maintenance approaches either reactive or
time-based preventive are limited in their ability to preempt machine failures,
leading to unplanned downtimes and elevated service costs. This research
presents a novel predictive maintenance framework tailored for vending machines
by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning (ML)
algorithms. The proposed system continuously monitors machine components and
operating conditions in real time and applies predictive models to forecast
failures before they occur. This enables timely maintenance scheduling,
minimizing downtime and extending machine lifespan. The framework was validated
through simulated fault data and performance evaluation using classification
algorithms. Results show a significant improvement in early fault detection and
a reduction in redundant service interventions. The findings indicate that
predictive maintenance systems, when integrated into vending infrastructure,
can transform operational efficiency and service reliability.

TL;DR: Modern LLMs can understand structured data like graphs, reducing supervision needs. A parameter-free graph encoder using Fock space representations simplifies and generalizes graph-related question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for graph-based tasks with minimal supervision and architecture adjustments, while ensuring versatility across graph types.

Method: Uses a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, combined with prefix-tuned prompts and a pre-trained LLM.

Result: The model effectively answers graph-related questions for various graph types (simple graphs, proteins, hypergraphs) with minimal adjustments.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well across diverse graph structures.

Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed
capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as
graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision
while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer
questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some
description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For
a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play
together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions
well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization
to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free
graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from
mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The
simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small
adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range
of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned
prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The
modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from
simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if
any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies
existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based
structures effortlessly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex models for spatiotemporal forecasting suffer from low training efficiency and high memory consumption.

Method: SDKD uses frequency-aligned knowledge distillation to transfer multi-scale spectral features from teacher to student, capturing both high and low-frequency components.

Result: SDKD reduces MSE by 81.3% and MAE by 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes dataset, improving performance while lowering computational complexity.

Conclusion: SDKD effectively balances high-frequency details and long-term trends, offering a practical solution for lightweight spatiotemporal forecasting.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,
and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low
training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a
lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),
which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex
teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher
model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its
latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency
trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).
However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in
slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a
frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale
spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low
frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both
local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental
results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions
of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.
The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term
trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: Multi-head attention enhances information propagation in Transformers, outperforming single-head under diversity conditions, with empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the theoretical advantages of multi-head attention beyond parallel processing, reframing it as synergistic computational graphs.

Method: Reframed multi-head attention as a system of feedforward DAGs with a common sink state, analyzed mixing time and minimax fidelity, and trained Transformers on sequence tasks.

Result: Multi-head attention improves mixing times and minimax fidelity under head-diversity conditions, empirically validated.

Conclusion: Multi-head attention's synergistic properties enhance performance, justifying its use over single-head in Transformers.

Abstract: Multi-head attention powers Transformer networks, the primary deep learning
architecture behind the success of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the
theoretical advantages of multi-head versus single-head attention, beyond mere
parallel processing, remain underexplored. In this paper, we reframe multi-head
attention as a system of potentially synergistic computational graphs, where
each head functions as a feedforward directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a common
sink state. We provide intuition and preliminary theoretical analysis of mixing
time and minimax fidelity in this framework. Our results show that multi-head
attention can synergistically enhance information propagation, yielding faster
mixing times and minimax fidelity amplification under specific head-diversity
conditions. Finally, we train single-head and multi-head Transformers, each
with the same total number of parameters, on sequence manipulation tasks and
empirically verify the predicted effects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InvisibleInk is a scalable framework for generating private long-form text with differential privacy, reducing computation costs significantly while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to safely incorporate private information into LLM-based text generation, addressing the challenge of differential privacy in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling.

Method: InvisibleInk interprets sampling from the LLM's next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism, isolating and clipping sensitive logits and sampling from a superset of top-k private tokens.

Result: Empirical evaluations show an 8× reduction in computation cost over baselines, generating private text at less than 10× the cost of non-private generation.

Conclusion: InvisibleInk effectively balances privacy and utility, offering a scalable solution for private long-form text generation.

Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms
such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely
incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open
question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation
framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to
the sensitive references. It interprets sampling from the LLM's
next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with
two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping
only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public
logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling from a small superset of
the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent
$8\times$ reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to
generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. In
summary, InvisibleInk is able to generate private long-form text at less than
$10\times$ the computation cost of non-private generation.

Motivation: Address concerns about LLM accuracy in biomedical question answering by ensuring answers are evidence-supported.

Method: Comparative pipeline using Alexandria (novel evidence-based RAG) and PubMed-based systems to evaluate physician-submitted questions.

Result: PubMed systems supported 44% of answers, novel evidence 50%, and combined sources covered over 70%.

Conclusion: LLMs need systems that accurately retrieve or generate evidence to maximize their value in summarizing scientific content.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for biomedical question
answering raises concerns about the accuracy and evidentiary support of their
responses. To address this, we present Answered with Evidence, a framework for
evaluating whether LLM-generated answers are grounded in scientific literature.
We analyzed thousands of physician-submitted questions using a comparative
pipeline that included: (1) Alexandria, fka the Atropos Evidence Library, a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on novel observational
studies, and (2) two PubMed-based retrieval-augmented systems (System and
Perplexity). We found that PubMed-based systems provided evidence-supported
answers for approximately 44% of questions, while the novel evidence source did
so for about 50%. Combined, these sources enabled reliable answers to over 70%
of biomedical queries. As LLMs become increasingly capable of summarizing
scientific content, maximizing their value will require systems that can
accurately retrieve both published and custom-generated evidence or generate
such evidence in real time.

Method: Experimental characterization of five material formulations under tension and torsion, paired with a PANN model combining a pICNN for hyperelasticity and QLV for viscoelasticity, enhanced by $L_0$ sparsification.

Result: The model accurately predicts nonlinear, rate-dependent behavior for interpolated compositions, demonstrating high predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: The PANN framework offers a scalable solution for automated, composition-aware constitutive modeling in multi-material 3D printing.

Abstract: Multi-material 3D printing, particularly through polymer jetting, enables the
fabrication of digital materials by mixing distinct photopolymers at the micron
scale within a single build to create a composite with tunable mechanical
properties. This work presents an integrated experimental and computational
investigation into the composition-dependent mechanical behavior of 3D printed
digital materials. We experimentally characterize five formulations, combining
soft and rigid UV-cured polymers under uniaxial tension and torsion across
three strain and twist rates. The results reveal nonlinear and rate-dependent
responses that strongly depend on composition. To model this behavior, we
develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) that combines a partially
input convex neural network (pICNN) for learning the composition-dependent
hyperelastic strain energy function with a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV)
formulation for time-dependent response. The pICNN ensures convexity with
respect to strain invariants while allowing non-convex dependence on
composition. To enhance interpretability, we apply $L_0$ sparsification. For
the time-dependent response, we introduce a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
predict viscoelastic relaxation parameters from composition. The proposed model
accurately captures the nonlinear, rate-dependent behavior of 3D printed
digital materials in both uniaxial tension and torsion, achieving high
predictive accuracy for interpolated material compositions. This approach
provides a scalable framework for automated, composition-aware constitutive
model discovery for multi-material 3D printing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework (GRPO) for Medical Image Grounding (MIG) without costly Chain-of-Thought annotations, using Spatial-Semantic Rewards and Chain-of-Box templates to improve spatial and semantic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs for MIG rely on expensive CoT annotations. The goal is to reduce annotation costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Adapts GRPO to VLMs, introduces Spatial-Semantic Rewards (spatial accuracy + semantic consistency), and uses Chain-of-Box templates for explicit spatial reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-CXR, ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg datasets. Ablation studies confirm component effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully reduces dependency on CoT annotations while improving MIG performance through spatial-semantic rewards and explicit reasoning.

Abstract: Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in
medical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only
perceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.
Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire
reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without
requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement
learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the
Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model
without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic
Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward
to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative
completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which
integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think>
reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial
regions during intermediate steps. Experiments on three datasets MS-CXR,
ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in Medical Image Grounding. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. Code,
checkpoints, and datasets are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task called interactive action planning, combining topological affordance memory with transformers for egocentric goal-oriented action planning in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting meaningful environmental information for high-level goal-oriented actions from an egocentric perspective.

Method: Proposes a method combining topological affordance memory with transformer architecture to memorize environment structure and detect action deviations.

Result: The approach learns meaningful representations, improving performance and robustness against action deviations in simulations.

Conclusion: The method effectively plans actions and handles deviations, demonstrating its versatility in realistic interactive simulations.

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting
meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this
research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented
actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a
novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines
topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of
memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances
facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the
memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific
objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic
interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved
performance and robust when action deviations occur.

*Kimberly F. Greco,Zongxin Yang,Mengyan Li,Han Tong,Sara Morini Sweet,Alon Geva,Kenneth D. Mandl,Benjamin A. Raby,Tianxi Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A weakly supervised, transformer-based framework combines gold-standard and silver-standard labels to improve rare disease detection using EHR data, validated with notable improvements in classification and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare diseases are hard to diagnose due to low prevalence and limited data. Existing label sources are either scarce or noisy, necessitating a hybrid approach.

Method: The framework uses a transformer architecture to refine medical concept embeddings and patient-level representations, combining gold and silver labels for training.

Result: Validated on rare pulmonary diseases, the model outperforms baselines in classification, subphenotype identification, and disease progression prediction.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable rare disease detection and stratification, benefiting clinical care and research.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet
individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to
diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While
computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease
detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and
biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and
expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and
the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health
records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial
noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,
transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels
with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from
EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and
generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the
scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning
embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence
patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level
representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare
pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from
Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in
phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes
through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to
baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to
enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for
clinical care and research applications.

TL;DR: New generalization bounds for neural networks on Riemannian manifolds, incorporating manifold-specific properties for sharper complexity bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theories rely on Euclidean geometry, failing to account for non-Euclidean intrinsic structures.

Method: Derived covering number bounds using manifold properties like sectional curvature, volume growth, and injectivity radius.

Result: Sharper Rademacher complexity bounds, recovering Euclidean results for zero curvature and improving for curved manifolds.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical and practical insights into how intrinsic geometry affects learning capacity in deep learning.

Abstract: In this work, we develop new generalization bounds for neural networks
trained on data supported on Riemannian manifolds. Existing generalization
theories often rely on complexity measures derived from Euclidean geometry,
which fail to account for the intrinsic structure of non-Euclidean spaces. Our
analysis introduces a geometric refinement: we derive covering number bounds
that explicitly incorporate manifold-specific properties such as sectional
curvature, volume growth, and injectivity radius. These geometric corrections
lead to sharper Rademacher complexity bounds for classes of Lipschitz neural
networks defined on compact manifolds. The resulting generalization guarantees
recover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve
substantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional
manifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the
tightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential
volume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved
spaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework
provides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning
capacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep
learning on structured data domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy of the DrugMatrix dataset completion by leveraging its 3D structure (tissue, treatment, transcriptomic measurements) and machine learning.

Method: Tensor-based completion, preserving 3D data structure, compared against Canonical Polyadic decomposition and 2D matrix factorization.

Result: Lower mean squared and absolute errors, better data distribution reflection, and organ-specific variability capture. Non-negative tensor completion also reveals tissue relationships.

Conclusion: The method improves dataset accuracy and offers potential for cross-species drug studies, e.g., rats to humans.

Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix
toxicogenomics dataset. Our hypothesis is that by preserving the 3-dimensional
structure of the data, which comprises tissue, treatment, and transcriptomic
measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach
will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that
the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data
distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed
tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute
errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and
2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative
tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our
findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database
with improved accuracy but also offer a promising methodology for future
studies of drugs that may cross species barriers, for example, from rats to
humans.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GATN, a deep RL framework for cross-domain task generalization, robustness, and efficient transfer learning, outperforming baselines in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing underexplored challenges in transfer learning for RL, such as task generalization, environmental robustness, and computational efficiency.

Method: GATN uses a domain-agnostic representation module, robustness-aware policy adapter, and efficient transfer scheduler.

Result: Superior performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments, and reduced computational overhead on benchmarks like Atari 2600 and MuJoCo.

Conclusion: GATN is a versatile framework suitable for real-world RL applications like adaptive chatbots and robotic control.

Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage
knowledge from source tasks to accelerate learning in target tasks. While prior
work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses
negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain
underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network
(GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across
domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in
transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a
robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve
these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600,
MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior
performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments,
and reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest
GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive

*Jasper Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves that catastrophic failures are unavoidable in universal approximators due to inherent mathematical limits, reframing safety as managing irreducible uncontrollability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish fundamental limits on universal approximation theorem (UAT) systems, showing that perfect control is mathematically impossible due to inherent instabilities.

Method: A three-level argument: combinatorial necessity (density of failures linked to expressive power), topological necessity (singularity theory), and empirical necessity (adversarial examples).

Result: Demonstrates that perfect alignment is impossible, with a quantitative 'Impossibility Sandwich' showing usefulness and safety are mutually exclusive.

Conclusion: Safety in UAT systems must shift from perfect control to managing unavoidable instabilities, impacting future development and governance.

Abstract: We establish fundamental mathematical limits on universal approximation
theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an
inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is
that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful
computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make
perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a
three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal
approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of
practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we
prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional
to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any
theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the
ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the
dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical
Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is
empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing
any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results,
combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum
complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety,
demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a
mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a
problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in
the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for
the future of UAT development and governance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a four-level taxonomy for data protection in generative AI, addressing non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability to balance utility and control across the AI lifecycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data protection is insufficient for modern AI, risking societal and individual harm, necessitating clear safeguards.

Method: A four-level taxonomy is introduced, analyzing technical approaches and regulatory gaps for each level.

Result: The framework highlights trade-offs between data utility and control, revealing blind spots in current regulations.

Conclusion: The paper urges rethinking data protection for AI, offering guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators.

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the
meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now
permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape
model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model
deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection
insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly
defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and
individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and
rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a
four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,
traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs
arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a
structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,
spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,
system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical
approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical
assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies
and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of
rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance
for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACRSLF, an adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor model, to address challenges in optimizing high-dimensional, incomplete data. It outperforms existing methods in convergence speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data are common but challenging to model due to non-convex optimization issues in second-order latent factor models.

Method: ACRSLF uses self-tuning cubic regularization and multi-Hessian-vector products for stable and precise optimization.

Result: ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher accuracy than existing optimizer-based LFA models on industrial datasets.

Conclusion: ACRSLF effectively addresses optimization challenges in HDI data modeling, offering improved performance.

Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node
interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications.
Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling
this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of
the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the
Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become
essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this
study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis
(ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning
cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization
instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate
gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation.
Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the
ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the
advancing optimizer-based LFA models.

TL;DR: Optimas is a unified framework for optimizing compound AI systems by aligning local rewards with global performance, outperforming baselines by 11.92%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing compound AI systems is challenging due to non-differentiable structures and diverse configurations.

Method: Optimas uses Local Reward Functions (LRFs) per component, ensuring local-global alignment and maximizing local rewards.

Result: Optimas improves performance by 11.92% on average across five real-world systems.

Conclusion: Optimas provides a general and effective approach for optimizing compound AI systems.

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language
Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are
increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing
compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures
and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,
hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose
Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.
The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per
component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each
component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each
iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while
simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables
independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated
optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead
to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world
compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an
average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for
improving compound systems. Our website is at https://optimas.stanford.edu.

TL;DR: The paper argues that optimization methods in AI, despite their success, have inherent flaws like catastrophic forgetting and overfitting, limiting progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It suggests world-modelling methods as a better alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the limitations of optimization methods in achieving true artificial cognition and to explore alternatives like world-modelling methods.

Method: Formal proof of inherent flaws in optimization methods, discussion of overfitting, and empirical demonstration of world-modelling methods.

Result: Optimization methods are inherently flawed for AGI; world-modelling methods avoid these issues.

Conclusion: AI must look beyond machine learning for methods to achieve artificial cognition.

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field has focused on developing optimisation
methods to solve multiple problems, specifically problems that we thought to be
only solvable through cognition. The obtained results have been outstanding,
being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these
optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a
true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic
forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper
formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as
such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General
Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the
problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that
optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling
methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of
Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to
find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for runtime verification of algorithmic fairness in machine-learned systems with unknown models, using monitors to estimate fairness with proven correctness and adaptable error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring fairness in machine-learned systems is critical to avoid bias based on sensitive attributes, especially when system models are unknown.

Method: Introduces a specification language for fairness properties and builds monitors to estimate fairness dynamically using statistical tools. Two monitoring algorithms are presented: one with uniform error bounds and another with non-uniform bounds.

Result: Monitors provide quantitative fairness estimates with proven correctness and adaptable error bounds. Prototype implementation shows efficient real-time monitoring (less than a millisecond per update).

Conclusion: The framework effectively verifies algorithmic fairness in real-time, with practical applications in loan and admission systems, demonstrating efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: Machine-learned systems are in widespread use for making decisions about
humans, and it is important that they are fair, i.e., not biased against
individuals based on sensitive attributes.
  We present a general framework of runtime verification of algorithmic
fairness for systems whose models are unknown, but are assumed to have a Markov
chain structure, with or without full observation of the state space.
  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic
fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social
burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a
given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of
how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a
given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed
sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a
uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform,
pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the
dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness
specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is
fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a
college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial
burden on the society.
  In these experiments, our monitors took less than a millisecond to update
their verdicts after each observation.

TL;DR: The paper explores 8:16 semi-structured sparsity for LLM compression, showing it outperforms 2:4 sparsity in flexibility and performance, while techniques like variance correction enhance results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient compression techniques are needed for large language models (LLMs) as they grow in size, addressing limitations of existing methods like structured sparsity.

Method: The study investigates 8:16 semi-structured sparsity, applies sparse structured patterns for salient weights, and uses techniques like variance correction and weight equalization.

Result: 8:16 sparsity surpasses performance thresholds, offers flexibility with minimal storage overhead, and competes with unstructured approaches.

Conclusion: Semi-structured sparsity, combined with simple techniques, improves LLM compression, achieving competitive or better results than existing methods.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression
techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While
quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity
methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited
flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16
semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance
Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or
smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4
sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875
vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient
weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with
unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we
demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant
like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores autograding handwritten graphs and text in STEM using multimodal meta-learning models and compares them with Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). Meta-learning models excel in 2-way classification, while VLLMs perform better in 3-way tasks, though their reliability needs further study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for efficient online math assessments and the lack of research on autograding handwritten graphs in STEM curricula drive this study.

Method: Multimodal meta-learning models are implemented for autograding handwritten graphs and text, and their performance is compared with VLLMs using a real-world dataset.

Result: Meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification, while VLLMs slightly outperform in 3-way tasks. VLLMs' reliability remains uncertain.

Conclusion: While VLLMs show promise, meta-learning models are more reliable for simpler tasks, and further research is needed to validate VLLMs' practical applicability.

Abstract: With the rise of online learning, the demand for efficient and consistent
assessment in mathematics has significantly increased over the past decade.
Machine Learning (ML), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been
widely used for autograding student responses, particularly those involving
text and/or mathematical expressions. However, there has been limited research
on autograding responses involving students' handwritten graphs, despite their
prevalence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
curricula. In this study, we implement multimodal meta-learning models for
autograding images containing students' handwritten graphs and text. We further
compare the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with these
specially trained metalearning models. Our results, evaluated on a real-world
dataset collected from our institution, show that the best-performing
meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification tasks. In
contrast, in more complex 3-way classification tasks, the best-performing VLLMs
slightly outperform the meta-learning models. While VLLMs show promising
results, their reliability and practical applicability remain uncertain and
require further investigation.

*Hao Yang,Angela Yao,Christopher Whalen,Gengchen Mai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BERT4Traj is a transformer-based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories from sparse data, outperforming traditional methods like Markov Chains and LSTMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human mobility data is often sparse due to limitations in collection methods, hindering applications in public health, transportation, and urban planning.

Method: BERT4Traj uses spatial and temporal embeddings, along with contextual features like demographics, inspired by BERT's masked language modeling and self-attention mechanisms.

Result: BERT4Traj significantly outperforms traditional models on real-world CDR and GPS datasets, reconstructing detailed and continuous mobility trajectories.

Conclusion: BERT4Traj enhances insights into human movement patterns by effectively addressing sparsity in mobility data.

Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health,
transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from
sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS
sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during
communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a
transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by
predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's
masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj
leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background
features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real
world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains,
KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs
detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human
movement patterns.

### [125] [Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine: Goal-Seeded Simulation via Inverted Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03065)
*Xin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine (C²HM), an extension of the Helmholtz Machine, which reframes inference as a goal-directed, asymmetric process using structured internal priors for improved representational efficiency and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Helmholtz Machine's reliance on symmetric, data-driven updates limits its ability for goal-directed reasoning or simulating extended processes. C²HM addresses this by integrating top-down structure with bottom-up evidence.

Method: C²HM uses a cycle-consistent formulation, simulating latent trajectories conditioned on goals and aligning them with observations through forward generation and inverse refinement, formalized under the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP).

Result: C²HM improves representational efficiency, supports memory chaining, and enables spatial compositional imagination, bridging memory-based planning and unsupervised learning.

Conclusion: C²HM offers a biologically inspired alternative to classical amortized inference, reconceiving generative modeling as intentional simulation in a unified probabilistic framework.

Abstract: The Helmholtz Machine (HM) is a foundational architecture for unsupervised
learning, coupling a bottom-up recognition model with a top-down generative
model through alternating inference. However, its reliance on symmetric,
data-driven updates constrains its ability to perform goal-directed reasoning
or simulate temporally extended processes. In this work, we introduce the
\emph{Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine} (C$^2$HM), a novel extension that
reframes inference as a \emph{goal-seeded}, \emph{asymmetric} process grounded
in structured internal priors. Rather than inferring latent causes solely from
sensory data, C$^2$HM simulates plausible latent trajectories conditioned on
abstract goals, aligning them with observed outcomes through a recursive cycle
of forward generation and inverse refinement. This cycle-consistent formulation
integrates top-down structure with bottom-up evidence via a variational loop,
enforcing mutual alignment between goal-conditioned latent predictions and
recognition-based reconstructions. We formalize this mechanism within the
framework of the \emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP), which
posits that inference proceeds by aligning structured, low-entropy content with
high-entropy, ambiguous context. C$^2$HM improves representational efficiency,
supports memory chaining via path-dependent inference, and enables spatial
compositional imagination. By offering a biologically inspired alternative to
classical amortized inference, $C^2$HM reconceives generative modeling as
intentional simulation, bridging memory-based planning and unsupervised
learning in a unified probabilistic framework.

*Karim Abdel Sadek,Matthew Farrugia-Roberts,Usman Anwar,Hannah Erlebach,Christian Schroeder de Witt,David Krueger,Michael Dennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes goal misgeneralization in reinforcement learning, showing it occurs under MEV but not MMER objectives. Empirical results in grid-worlds confirm MEV's vulnerability and MMER's robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risk of policies pursuing proxy goals instead of intended ones in novel environments, formalizing and mitigating goal misgeneralization.

Method: Theoretical analysis of goal misgeneralization under MEV and MMER objectives, followed by empirical testing in procedurally-generated grid-worlds using domain randomization (MEV) and UED (MMER).

Result: Goal misgeneralization occurs under MEV but not MMER. UED methods (MMER-based) show robustness, though they don't always find MMER policies.

Conclusion: Minimax expected regret (MMER) is a promising approach to mitigate goal misgeneralization in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Safe generalization in reinforcement learning requires not only that a
learned policy acts capably in new situations, but also that it uses its
capabilities towards the pursuit of the designer's intended goal. The latter
requirement may fail when a proxy goal incentivizes similar behavior to the
intended goal within the training environment, but not in novel deployment
environments. This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit
of the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon
known as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem
setting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal
misgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal
misgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum
expected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER)
objective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method
of domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in
procedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based
unsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal
misgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases). Our
findings suggest that minimax expected regret is a promising approach to
mitigating goal misgeneralization.

*Ali SaraerToosi,Renbo Tu,Kamyar Azizzadenesheli,Aviad Levis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuralDMD combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition to reconstruct spatio-temporal dynamics from sparse, noisy measurements, outperforming baselines in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific imaging often encounters unseen dynamics from indirect, noisy, and sparse measurements, requiring a robust framework for reconstruction.

Method: NeuralDMD integrates neural implicit representations for spatial complexity and DMD for linear dynamical modes, enabling stable, low-dimensional representations and forecasting.

Result: NeuralDMD outperforms established baselines in reconstructing wind-speed fields and plasma evolution near Sgr A*.

Conclusion: NeuralDMD is a promising general tool for imaging dynamical systems in geoscience, astronomy, and other fields.

Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from
turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins.
Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging
often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy,
and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework
that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such
measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing
complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce
an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional
representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world
problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from
sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the
Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms
established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for
imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

### [128] [SymMatika: Structure-Aware Symbolic Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03110)
*Michael Scherk,Boyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SymMatika is a hybrid symbolic regression algorithm combining genetic programming with a reusable motif library, achieving state-of-the-art performance in recovering explicit and implicit mathematical expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symbolic regression methods lack support for both explicit and implicit relations and fail to reuse structural patterns, limiting efficiency and discovery.

Method: SymMatika uses multi-island genetic programming and a motif library to identify and reuse high-impact substructures, along with a feedback-driven evolutionary engine and implicit-derivative metrics.

Result: SymMatika outperforms previous methods, achieving higher recovery rates, solving previously unsolved problems, and accelerating discovery by up to 100x.

Conclusion: SymMatika demonstrates the effectiveness of structure-aware evolutionary search and is open-sourced to advance interpretable modeling and symbolic discovery.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical
expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced
the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or
discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and
accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each
expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural
patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR
algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable
motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies
high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to
guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven
evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery
using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves
state-of-the-art recovery rates, achieving 5.1% higher performance than the
previous best results on Nguyen, the first recovery of Nguyen-12, and
competitive performance on the Feynman equations. It also recovers implicit
physical laws from Eureqa datasets up to $100\times$ faster. Our results
demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific
discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic
discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.

TL;DR: BLaST introduces a robust sparsification method for ML models, achieving high sparsity with minimal accuracy loss and significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy consumption in large-scale ML models is dominated by data movement, and existing sparsification methods degrade accuracy or performance.

Method: BLaST iteratively sparsifies weight matrices into a block sparsity pattern for efficient SpMM multiplication.

Result: Achieves 95% sparsity with negligible accuracy loss, 16.7x speedup over dense MLPs, and reduces memory usage by up to 3.12x.

Conclusion: BLaST reduces energy use, memory footprint, and latency, enabling next-gen large-scale AI systems.

Abstract: The energy consumption of large-scale ML models is dominated by data movement
- shuffling billions of parameters across memory hierarchies and data centers.
Effective sparsification to prune redundant parameters is still challenging:
existing methods incur significant accuracy degradation, performance overhead,
or both. We introduce (Bl)ock (a)nd (S)parse (T)ransformers (BLaST), a general,
robust, and reliable sparsification method applicable to linear layers in all
settings. Our method iteratively sparsifies weight matrices into a block
sparsity pattern suitable for efficient sparse matrix-matrix (SpMM)
multiplication. BLaST achieves up to 95% sparsity in MLP weights with
negligible accuracy loss. Our fused, highly optimized Sparse MLP kernel
delivers up to 16.7x speedup over dense MLPs across 9 architectures and 8
datasets, resulting in up to 1.6x inference speedup, 1.11x pretraining speedup
and up to 3.12x inference memory usage reduction. BLaST enables the next
generation of large-scale AI systems by reducing energy use, memory footprint,
and latency.

TL;DR: A novel method using neural networks to compute 3D Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria, achieving competitive or better results than conventional solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of neural networks in solving complex physical problems like 3D Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria, aiming for improved accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Parametrize Fourier modes with neural networks and minimize the global force residual using first-order optimizers.

Result: Neural networks achieve competitive computational cost and lower residuals than conventional solvers, setting a new lower bound for force residuals.

Conclusion: Neural networks show promise for solving single equilibria and modeling continuous distributions of equilibria, with potential for further improvements.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic
equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and
compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear
global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with
first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to
arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased
computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural
networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use
minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for
solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing
neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

TL;DR: LLMs show overconfidence in initial answers but excessive doubt when challenged, explained by choice-supportive bias and hypersensitivity to inconsistent advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the paradoxical confidence behaviors of LLMs, combining overconfidence and doubt.

Method: Developed a novel experimental paradigm to measure LLM confidence without memory bias, testing models like Gemma 3, GPT4o, and o1-preview.

Result: LLMs exhibit choice-supportive bias and overweight inconsistent advice, deviating from normative Bayesian updating.

Conclusion: Two mechanisms—consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to contradictory feedback—explain LLM confidence behaviors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they
can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the
same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this
apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the
unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory
of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We
show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced
choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence
in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We
further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to
consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative
Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive
to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to
contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different
domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM
confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to
criticism.

*Ron Tsibulsky,Daniel Nevo,Uri Shalit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using set-valued predictors to improve robustness in Domain Generalization (DG), introducing a theoretical framework and a practical optimization method, validated on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving robustness in DG tasks is challenging, as models must perform well on unseen domains. Existing single-valued prediction methods limit robustness, motivating the exploration of set-valued predictors.

Method: The authors introduce a theoretical framework for set prediction in DG and propose a practical optimization method that balances robust performance on unseen domains with small prediction set sizes.

Result: The approach is evaluated on real-world datasets from the WILDS benchmark, showing promising results for robust domain generalization.

Conclusion: Set-valued predictors offer a viable direction for enhancing robustness in DG, supported by theoretical insights and practical validation.

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements in modern machine learning, achieving
robustness in Domain Generalization (DG) tasks remains a significant challenge.
In DG, models are expected to perform well on samples from unseen test
distributions (also called domains), by learning from multiple related training
distributions. Most existing approaches to this problem rely on single-valued
predictions, which inherently limit their robustness. We argue that set-valued
predictors could be leveraged to enhance robustness across unseen domains,
while also taking into account that these sets should be as small as possible.
We introduce a theoretical framework defining successful set prediction in the
DG setting, focusing on meeting a predefined performance criterion across as
many domains as possible, and provide theoretical insights into the conditions
under which such domain generalization is achievable. We further propose a
practical optimization method compatible with modern learning architectures,
that balances robust performance on unseen domains with small prediction set
sizes. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets from the WILDS
benchmark, demonstrating its potential as a promising direction for robust
domain generalization.

*Weishu Deng,Yujie Yang,Peiran Du,Lingfeng Xiang,Zhen Lin,Chen Zhong,Song Jiang,Hui Lu,Jia Rao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HGCA is a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism for scalable LLM inference, combining dense and sparse attention to optimize memory and compute while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited GPU memory for KV caches in large language models (LLMs) hinders scalability. Existing solutions underutilize CPU resources or sacrifice accuracy.

Method: HGCA uses dense attention on GPU-retained KV entries and parallel sparse attention on CPU-stored salient entries, merging outputs with log-sum-exp fusion. It includes per-head sparsification for CPU efficiency.

Result: HGCA outperforms baselines in scalability, sequence length, batch size, and accuracy on commodity GPUs.

Conclusion: HGCA enables efficient, high-quality LLM inference without model retraining, leveraging hybrid CPU-GPU resources effectively.

Abstract: Scaling inference for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by limited GPU memory, especially due to growing key-value (KV)
caches required for long-context generation. While existing approaches offload
KV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they
often underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy. We present
HGCA, a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism that enables scalable,
high-throughput LLM inference with near-full attention quality. HGCA performs
dense attention on recently generated KV entries retained in GPU memory and
parallel sparse attention on selected, salient KV entries in CPU memory. The
attention outputs are efficiently merged using log-sum-exp fusion, minimizing
PCIe transfer overhead. HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head
sparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual
relevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates
into existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining. Experiments
across diverse models and workloads show that HGCA achieves superior
scalability, supports longer sequences and larger batch sizes, and outperforms
existing sparse attention baselines in both performance and accuracy -- all on
commodity GPU hardware.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PiCME introduces a contrastive learning pipeline for integrating diverse clinical data, improving prediction tasks like mortality and phenotype prediction, and addressing performance plateaus with a Modality-Gated LSTM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance clinical prediction by integrating multiple patient data types (text, imaging, time-series, demographics) using contrastive learning, which is underutilized in clinical settings beyond image-text pairs.

Method: PiCME pre-trains contrastive models on 26 combinations of 2-5 modalities from MIMIC, evaluates on mortality and phenotype prediction, and introduces a Modality-Gated LSTM to weight modalities by importance.

Result: Contrastive models match supervised baselines, especially with 3 modalities. Performance drops beyond 3 modalities, mitigated by Modality-Gated LSTM (AUROC: 73.19% to 76.93%; AUPRC: 51.27% to 62.26%).

Conclusion: PiCME scales contrastive learning across all MIMIC modalities, providing insights for modality selection, training, and equitable clinical prediction, with strengths in interpretability and fairness.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning holds promise for improving clinical prediction by
integrating diverse patient data, including text, imaging, time-series, and
structured demographics. Contrastive learning facilitates this integration by
producing a unified representation that can be reused across tasks, reducing
the need for separate models or encoders. Although contrastive learning has
seen success in vision-language domains, its use in clinical settings remains
largely limited to image and text pairs. We propose the Pipeline for
Contrastive Modality Evaluation and Encoding (PiCME), which systematically
assesses five clinical data types from MIMIC: discharge summaries, radiology
reports, chest X-rays, demographics, and time-series. We pre-train contrastive
models on all 26 combinations of two to five modalities and evaluate their
utility on in-hospital mortality and phenotype prediction. To address
performance plateaus with more modalities, we introduce a Modality-Gated LSTM
that weights each modality according to its contrastively learned importance.
Our results show that contrastive models remain competitive with supervised
baselines, particularly in three-modality settings. Performance declines beyond
three modalities, which supervised models fail to recover. The Modality-Gated
LSTM mitigates this drop, improving AUROC from 73.19% to 76.93% and AUPRC from
51.27% to 62.26% in the five-modality setting. We also compare contrastively
learned modality importance scores with attribution scores and evaluate
generalization across demographic subgroups, highlighting strengths in
interpretability and fairness. PiCME is the first to scale contrastive learning
across all modality combinations in MIMIC, offering guidance for modality
selection, training strategies, and equitable clinical prediction.

*Zejin Lu,Sushrut Thorat,Radoslaw M Cichy,Tim C Kietzmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-inspired developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision, improving alignment with human vision by focusing on learning methods rather than scaling up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the misalignment between AI and human vision, where AI lacks robustness and relies heavily on textures rather than shapes.

Method: Develop a developmental visual diet (DVD) based on human visual maturation, guiding AI through a human-inspired curriculum.

Result: AI models trained with DVD show stronger shape reliance, better abstract shape recognition, robustness to distortions, and resilience to adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Robust AI vision can be achieved by optimizing learning methods, not just data quantity, offering a resource-efficient path to human-like AI vision.

Abstract: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision
persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than
shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract
shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a
solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than
scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early
infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising
decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel
developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems
through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with
human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the
strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape
recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image
corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming
high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,
we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way
how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a
resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaTF integrates representation learning and generative modeling to learn low-dimensional latent variables and generate equilibrium distributions across temperatures, validated on diverse systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding thermodynamic properties and transition mechanisms requires accurate modeling of molecular system distributions, which current methods like Normalizing Flows lack without tailored representation learning.

Method: LaTF combines State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with Normalizing Flows (NFs) to jointly learn latent representations (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate equilibrium distributions beyond training data.

Result: LaTF successfully models equilibrium distributions and temperature-dependent behavior in systems like Chignolin protein and RNA tetraloop, aligning with experimental and computational results.

Conclusion: LaTF provides an effective end-to-end framework for learning interpretable latent representations and generating accurate equilibrium distributions, advancing thermodynamic modeling.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex
molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as
temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and
transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful
low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream
analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as
Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but
their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work,
we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that
tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF
unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to
simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as
Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate
equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two
components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized
jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow,
important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces
the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across
diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and
cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking
using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a
RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two
temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble
and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive
computational results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of transfer learning, assessing knowledge transferability remains a challenge, necessitating a unified understanding of metrics.

Method: The paper provides a taxonomy of transferability metrics, categorizing them by transferable knowledge types and measurement granularity.

Result: The survey offers insights into metric selection for specific applications, enhancing AI system reliability.

Conclusion: Open challenges and future research directions are discussed to advance trustworthy transfer learning.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial
intelligence, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a source task to improve
performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques
such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields
like computer vision and natural language processing. However, despite its
widespread use, how to reliably assess the transferability of knowledge remains
a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each
transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer
learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability
metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and

### [139] [DistZO2: High-Throughput and Memory-Efficient Zeroth-Order Fine-tuning LLMs with Distributed Parallel Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03211)
*Liangyu Wang,Huanyi Xie,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DistZO2 is a distributed framework for zeroth-order fine-tuning of large language models, improving throughput and memory efficiency over ZO2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models is resource-intensive, and existing zeroth-order methods like ZO2 are limited by single-device execution and modest throughput.

Method: DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies: Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), and a unified 2D Parallelism design, along with a hardware-aware communication strategy.

Result: DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 on OPT-175B, scaling zeroth-order fine-tuning to multi-GPU systems.

Conclusion: DistZO2 effectively addresses the memory and throughput limitations of ZO2, enabling efficient distributed zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains resource-intensive due to
their sheer scale. While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a
memory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to
multi-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute
throughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading
model parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with
dual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its
single-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we
present DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed
zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:
(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed
forward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted
to the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism
design that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication
bottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware
communication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them
across GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales
zeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory
efficiency while substantially improving training throughput. In our
experiments on OPT-175B, DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 with
distributed computing. DistZO2's code has been open-sourced in

### [140] [Neural Inhibition Improves Dynamic Routing and Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03221)
*Will Y. Zou,Jennifer Y. Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic routing in deep learning models can be enhanced with neural inhibition, improving performance by specializing pathways for data samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve dynamic routing models by incorporating neural inhibition, enabling better specialization and efficiency in neural pathways.

Method: Introduces neural inhibition in neural populations to inhibit shared signals, allowing dynamic routing models to select specialized expert paths.

Result: Neural inhibition significantly boosts performance in general tasks, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Neural inhibition is a promising under-studied approach for dynamic routing, Mixture-of-Experts, and transformer models, warranting further research.

Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to
dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of
neurons. We hypothesize dynamic routing models can be improved with neural
inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared
among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing
model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through
inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways.
We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation
methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language
models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm
significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort
to be invested in this research direction.

### [141] [Conformal Information Pursuit for Interactively Guiding Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03279)
*Kwan Ho Ryan Chan,Yuyan Ge,Edgar Dobriban,Hamed Hassani,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), a method to improve sequential querying in LLMs by using conformal prediction sets for better uncertainty estimation, outperforming traditional approaches in efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Information Pursuit (IP) struggles with accurate uncertainty estimation due to unreliable LLM probabilities, leading to suboptimal query selection. The paper aims to address this by leveraging conformal prediction sets.

Method: Proposes C-IP, which uses conformal prediction sets to estimate uncertainty at each query step, replacing conditional entropy with a distribution-free measure.

Result: C-IP outperforms IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods in predictive performance and query efficiency, validated on 20 Questions and MediQ datasets.

Conclusion: C-IP offers a robust, interpretable alternative for sequential querying in LLMs, achieving competitive performance with direct prediction while reducing query complexity.

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs)
is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM
agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant
information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper
explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected
number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy
algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information
gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate
estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very
difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which
leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better
estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information
Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on
conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship
between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate
uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast
to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a
distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with
20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter
query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based
chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical
setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves
competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering
greater interpretability.

*Ryan Solgi,Seyedali Mousavinezhad,Hugo A. Loaiciga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores low-rank properties of tensorized spatio-temporal atmospheric data (S5P-TN) and uses a low-rank tensor model (LRTM) to inpaint gaps, outperforming spatial interpolation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in Sentinel-5P tropospheric NO2 data caused by cloud obscuration and other factors, leveraging low-rank properties for accurate reconstruction.

Method: Adopts a low-rank tensor model (LRTM) based on CP decomposition and alternating least squares (ALS) for tensor completion, comparing results with geostatistical spatial interpolation.

Result: LRTM successfully reconstructs missing values, predicts outliers, and identifies hotspots, especially under extended cloud obscuration.

Conclusion: Tensor completion via LRTM is feasible and effective for large-scale spatio-temporal atmospheric data, offering improved gap-filling capabilities.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate for the first time the low-rank properties of a
tensorized large-scale spatio-temporal dynamic atmospheric variable. We focus
on the Sentinel-5P tropospheric NO2 product (S5P-TN) over a four-year period in
an area that encompasses the contiguous United States (CONUS). Here, it is
demonstrated that a low-rank approximation of such a dynamic variable is
feasible. We apply the low-rank properties of the S5P-TN data to inpaint gaps
in the Sentinel-5P product by adopting a low-rank tensor model (LRTM) based on
the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and alternating least squares (ALS).
Furthermore, we evaluate the LRTM's results by comparing them with spatial
interpolation using geostatistics, and conduct a comprehensive spatial
statistical and temporal analysis of the S5P-TN product. The results of this
study demonstrated that the tensor completion successfully reconstructs the
missing values in the S5P-TN product, particularly in the presence of extended
cloud obscuration, predicting outliers and identifying hotspots, when the data
is tensorized over extended spatial and temporal scales.

### [143] [Global Variational Inference Enhanced Robust Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03291)
*Lingkun Luo,Shiqiang Hu,Liming Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GVI-DA improves domain adaptation by using global variational inference for stable alignment and better generalization, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mini-batch training in deep learning-based DA limits global distribution modeling, causing unstable alignment and suboptimal generalization.

Method: GVI-DA learns continuous, class-conditional global priors via variational inference, uses latent feature reconstruction, global codebook learning, and discards low-confidence pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks and thirty-eight DA tasks.

Conclusion: GVI-DA is theoretically sound and practically efficient, offering robust domain adaptation.

Abstract: Deep learning-based domain adaptation (DA) methods have shown strong
performance by learning transferable representations. However, their reliance
on mini-batch training limits global distribution modeling, leading to unstable
alignment and suboptimal generalization. We propose Global Variational
Inference Enhanced Domain Adaptation (GVI-DA), a framework that learns
continuous, class-conditional global priors via variational inference to enable
structure-aware cross-domain alignment. GVI-DA minimizes domain gaps through
latent feature reconstruction, and mitigates posterior collapse using global
codebook learning with randomized sampling. It further improves robustness by
discarding low-confidence pseudo-labels and generating reliable target-domain
samples. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and thirty-eight DA tasks
demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance. We also derive the model's
evidence lower bound (ELBO) and analyze the effects of prior continuity,
codebook size, and pseudo-label noise tolerance. In addition, we compare GVI-DA
with diffusion-based generative frameworks in terms of optimization principles
and efficiency, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and practical
advantages.

### [144] [MGAA: Multi-Granular Adaptive Allocation fof Low-Rank Compression of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03294)
*Guangyan Li,Yongqiang Tang,Wensheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGAA is a novel adaptive parameter allocation method for LLM compression, improving efficiency by tailoring compression ratios to sublayer importance and weight matrix energy distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform compression ratios in LLMs ignore differentiated impacts on performance, and heuristic search strategies are inefficient and lack generalization.

Method: MGAA adaptively allocates parameters between and within sublayers using cosine similarity (for sublayer importance) and energy distribution (for weight matrices).

Result: MGAA outperforms existing methods across multiple LLMs and datasets, and improves performance in multimodal models like LLaVA.

Conclusion: MGAA offers a computationally efficient and generalized solution for adaptive parameter allocation in LLM compression.

Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model
compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource
demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank
approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless,
unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation
compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight
matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the
model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic
search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies
are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era
of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive
Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and
within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process.
MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns
compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs,
allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of
importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression
ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics,
ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone
models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance.
Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting
remarkable performance improvements.

*Zizhao Wang,Kaixin Wang,Li Zhao,Peter Stone,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dyn-O is an object-centric world model that improves representation learning and dynamics modeling, outperforming DreamerV3 in complex environments like Procgen games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object-centric world models lack generalization in visually complex settings, prompting the need for Dyn-O.

Method: Dyn-O uses object-centric representations, decoupling features into dynamics-agnostic and dynamics-aware components for better manipulation.

Result: Dyn-O outperforms DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy and generates diverse imagined trajectories.

Conclusion: Dyn-O advances object-centric world models, demonstrating effectiveness in complex environments and enabling finer feature control.

Abstract: World models aim to capture the dynamics of the environment, enabling agents
to predict and plan for future states. In most scenarios of interest, the
dynamics are highly centered on interactions among objects within the
environment. This motivates the development of world models that operate on
object-centric rather than monolithic representations, with the goal of more
effectively capturing environment dynamics and enhancing compositional
generalization. However, the development of object-centric world models has
largely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as
basic geometries). It remains underexplored whether such models can generalize
to more complex settings with diverse textures and cluttered scenes. In this
paper, we fill this gap by introducing Dyn-O, an enhanced structured world
model built upon object-centric representations. Compared to prior work in
object-centric representations, Dyn-O improves in both learning representations
and modeling dynamics. On the challenging Procgen games, we find that our
method can learn object-centric world models directly from pixel observations,
outperforming DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy. Furthermore, by
decoupling object-centric features into dynamics-agnostic and dynamics-aware
components, we enable finer-grained manipulation of these features and generate
more diverse imagined trajectories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) successes inspired exploring model scaling for VRPs, akin to large language models (LLMs).

Method: Developed LRM-1B, a large routing model, and evaluated it across various VRP scenarios, distributions, and sizes.

Result: LRM-1B outperforms existing models, adapts to diverse VRP challenges, and reveals power-law scaling behavior from 1M to 1B parameters.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of large-scale neural models for VRPs and provides insights for optimal configurations in neural routing solvers.

Abstract: Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are central to combinatorial optimization
with significant practical implications. Recent advancements in neural
combinatorial optimization (NCO) have demonstrated promising results by
leveraging neural networks to solve VRPs, yet the exploration of model scaling
within this domain remains underexplored. Inspired by the success of model
scaling in large language models (LLMs), this study introduces a Large Routing
Model with 1 billion parameters (LRM-1B), designed to address diverse VRP
scenarios. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LRM-1B across multiple
problem variants, distributions, and sizes, establishing state-of-the-art
results. Our findings reveal that LRM-1B not only adapts to different VRP
challenges but also showcases superior performance, outperforming existing
models. Additionally, we explore the scaling behavior of neural routing models
from 1M to 1B parameters. Our analysis confirms power-law between multiple
model factors and performance, offering critical insights into the optimal
configurations for foundation neural routing solvers.

*Weihong Li,Anpeng Wu,Kun Kuang,Keting Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReTimeCausal combines ANM and EM for causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series, addressing missing data and multi-scale interactions better than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle irregular sampling and multi-scale interactions in time series, lacking interpretability or granularity.

Method: ReTimeCausal integrates ANM and EM, using kernelized sparse regression and structural constraints to refine missing values and causal graphs iteratively.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthetic and real-world datasets under irregular sampling and missing data.

Conclusion: ReTimeCausal effectively bridges the gap in causal discovery for irregularly sampled time series, offering interpretability and robustness.

Abstract: This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a
pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate
science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort
causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to
reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate
shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming
from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal
regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting
real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and
Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with
sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural
constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and
causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data
issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under
challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JAX lacks robust support for mixed-precision training, which is essential for efficient neural network training. MPX fills this gap by providing a seamless solution.

Method: MPX integrates with JAX toolboxes, casts inputs/outputs to half precision, uses dynamic loss-scaling, and ensures correct precision for operations. It also provides wrappers for gradients and optimizers.

Result: MPX successfully simplifies mixed-precision training in JAX, addressing common issues like gradient underflow/overflow and preserving model accuracy.

Conclusion: MPX is a practical and efficient toolbox for mixed-precision training in JAX, enhancing training speed and ease of use without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Mixed-precision training has emerged as an indispensable tool for enhancing
the efficiency of neural network training in recent years. Concurrently, JAX
has grown in popularity as a versatile machine learning toolbox. However, it
currently lacks robust support for mixed-precision training. We propose MPX, a
mixed-precision training toolbox for JAX that simplifies and accelerates the
training of large-scale neural networks while preserving model accuracy. MPX
seamlessly integrates with popular toolboxes such as Equinox and Flax, allowing
users to convert full-precision pipelines to mixed-precision versions with
minimal modifications. By casting both inputs and outputs to half precision,
and introducing a dynamic loss-scaling mechanism, MPX alleviates issues like
gradient underflow and overflow that commonly arise in half precision
computations. Its design inherits critical features from JAX's type-promotion
behavior, ensuring that operations take place in the correct precision and
allowing for selective enforcement of full precision where needed (e.g., sums,
means, or softmax). MPX further provides wrappers for automatic creation and
management of mixed-precision gradients and optimizers, enabling
straightforward integration into existing JAX training pipelines. MPX's source
code, documentation, and usage examples are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an explainable AI (XAI) approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) and regularization techniques to improve drug property prediction and interpretability in structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in SAR modeling include limited activity data and sensitivity to molecular changes. The study aims to enhance explainability and accuracy in drug discovery.

Method: Leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs and GNNs with structure-aware loss functions. Used group lasso and sparse group lasso for feature pruning and explainability.

Result: Improved prediction accuracy (12.70% RMSE reduction) and interpretability, achieving RMSE=0.2551 and PCC=0.9572.

Conclusion: The approach enhances drug discovery pipelines by improving model interpretability and identifying key molecular substructures.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly
applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify
substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end
explainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR)
modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as
limited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle
molecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs,
i.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency,
targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB
IDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to
obtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity
(i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained
GNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage
molecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and
sparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the
structure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference
in molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by
integrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso,
reducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving
the lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore,
applying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the
contribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction
scores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model
interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating
important molecular substructures in lead optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a method to automatically determine feature dimension in linear attention using statistical degrees of freedom, improving performance without increasing inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of choosing feature dimensions in linear attention, which current methods fix uniformly, ignoring layer diversity.

Method: Uses statistical degrees of freedom to determine feature dimensions and introduces a layerwise training strategy for nonlinear features.

Result: Achieves smaller approximation error under fixed computational budget and improves distilled model performance.

Conclusion: Provides insights into attention mechanism complexity across layers and enhances efficiency of linear attention.

Abstract: Linear attention has attracted interest as a computationally efficient
approximation to softmax attention, especially for long sequences. Recent
studies have explored distilling softmax attention in pre-trained Transformers
into linear attention. However, a critical challenge remains: how to choose the
feature dimension that governs the approximation quality. Existing methods fix
this dimension uniformly across all attention layers, overlooking the diverse
roles and complexities of them. In this paper, we propose a principled method
to automatically determine the feature dimension in linear attention using the
concept of statistical degrees of freedom, which represent the effective
dimensionality of the inputs. We provide a theoretical bound on the
approximation error and show that the dimension chosen by our method achieves
smaller error under a fixed computational budget. Furthermore, we introduce an
efficient layerwise training strategy to learn nonlinear features tailored to
each layer. Experiments on multiple pre-trained transformers demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of distilled models compared to baselines
without increasing the inference cost. Our findings also provide insight into
how the complexity of the attention mechanism evolves across layers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity of ML applications leads to varied evaluation approaches, making model comparisons difficult. Absolute evaluation metrics offer a solution but lack comprehensive guidance on their use.

Method: The survey categorizes absolute evaluation metrics by learning problem type (classification, clustering, regression, ranking) to provide structured guidance.

Result: An organized overview of absolute evaluation metrics is provided, addressing gaps in understanding their appropriate use for different ML tasks.

Conclusion: The survey equips practitioners with tools to select suitable metrics, improving model evaluation and enabling meaningful comparisons across diverse applications.

Abstract: Machine Learning is a diverse field applied across various domains such as
computer science, social sciences, medicine, chemistry, and finance. This
diversity results in varied evaluation approaches, making it difficult to
compare models effectively. Absolute evaluation measures offer a practical
solution by assessing a model's performance on a fixed scale, independent of
reference models and data ranges, enabling explicit comparisons. However, many
commonly used measures are not universally applicable, leading to a lack of
comprehensive guidance on their appropriate use. This survey addresses this gap
by providing an overview of absolute evaluation metrics in ML, organized by the
type of learning problem. While classification metrics have been extensively
studied, this work also covers clustering, regression, and ranking metrics. By
grouping these measures according to the specific ML challenges they address,
this survey aims to equip practitioners with the tools necessary to select
appropriate metrics for their models. The provided overview thus improves
individual model evaluation and facilitates meaningful comparisons across
different models and applications.

Method: The authors use the $z$-transform method to analyze sequences, applying it to gradient descent, Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and stochastic gradient descent in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.

Result: The method effectively characterizes convergence behaviors, with spectral dimension playing a key role. It provides new asymptotic insights for various optimization techniques.

Conclusion: The $z$-transform method is versatile and effective for analyzing optimization algorithms, offering new asymptotic results and broadening its applicability beyond classical domains.

Abstract: The $z$-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal
processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It
allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many
operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its
$z$-transform. In particular, the $z$-transform method focuses on asymptotic
behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of
results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and
optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the
$z$-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the
simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,
we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We
then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and
stochastic gradient descent.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of big data and advanced analytics to improve decision-making in industrial engineering.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become
indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper
addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear
hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different
contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations
(pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China
(post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data
and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion
leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in
tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT),
ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to
generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this
approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust
under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to
broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain
management, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation
are key challenges. By merging advanced Deep Learning (DL), time-frequency
analysis, and social media insights, the proposed framework showcases how
large-scale data can elevate the quality and efficiency of decision-making
processes.

TL;DR: Proposes MLFGNN, a fusion of Graph Attention Networks and Graph Transformer, to improve molecular property prediction by capturing local and global structures, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs fail to simultaneously capture local and global molecular structures, limiting accurate property prediction in drug discovery.

Method: Combines Graph Attention Networks and a novel Graph Transformer, integrates molecular fingerprints, and uses adaptive fusion for multi-level and multi-modal representation.

Result: MLFGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification and regression tasks on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Multi-level and multi-modal fusion enhances molecular representation learning, as shown by interpretability analysis and superior performance.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is essential in drug discovery and
related fields. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle
to simultaneously capture both local and global molecular structures. In this
work, we propose a Multi-Level Fusion Graph Neural Network (MLFGNN) that
integrates Graph Attention Networks and a novel Graph Transformer to jointly
model local and global dependencies. In addition, we incorporate molecular
fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of
interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both classification and regression tasks. Interpretability analysis further
reveals that the model effectively captures task-relevant chemical patterns,
supporting the usefulness of multi-level and multi-modal fusion in molecular
representation learning.

*Victor Toscano-Duran,Florian Rottach,Bastian Rieck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) for molecular shape representation, showing competitive performance and enhanced results when combined with traditional methods like AVALON fingerprints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular shape is often underrepresented in learning approaches, despite its importance in determining properties. The study aims to incorporate explicit shape information for better molecular representation.

Method: The ECT is used as a geometrical-topological descriptor on molecular graphs, extracting multiscale structural features. Performance is tested on nine benchmark datasets for predicting the inhibition constant $K_i$, comparing ECT with traditional methods like fingerprints and GNNs.

Result: ECT-based representation performs competitively and, when combined with AVALON fingerprints, outperforms other methods on most datasets.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches incorporating shape information enhance molecular representations, suggesting new avenues for molecular machine learning. All experiments and code are openly shared for reproducibility.

Abstract: The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological
properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular
representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor.
Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic
features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features,
offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature
space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine
benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition
constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation
against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular
fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show
that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking
among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its
combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON
fingerprint, significantly \emph{enhances predictive performance},
outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the
complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for
being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid
approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more
informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new
avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and
foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and
code used in this work.

*Meng Xiao,Junfeng Zhou,Yuanchun Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework to automate feature generation for scientific data, addressing challenges like domain expertise and exponential search space. It combines multi-agent collaboration, reinforcement learning, and LLMs to enhance downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature generation methods for scientific data require extensive domain expertise and face scalability issues due to exponential search spaces. The DCAI paradigm inspires automation to overcome these challenges.

Method: MAFG uses multi-agents to collaboratively construct mathematical transformations, identify high-information features, and evolve strategies via reinforcement learning. LLMs interpret and evaluate features post-exploration.

Result: MAFG automates feature generation effectively, improving performance in downstream scientific data mining tasks, as shown in experiments and case studies.

Conclusion: The MAFG framework successfully automates feature generation, addressing traditional challenges and enhancing scientific data analysis.

Abstract: Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original
data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant
features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve
downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the
following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific
data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in
scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.
Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space
expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.
Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have
opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by
that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and
proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in
the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical
transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature
combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement
learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration
phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively
evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance
breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate
that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process
and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional uniform learning rates may not account for unique dynamics in different model parts, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: Introduces relative learning rates (RLRS) for different components, with hyperparameters tuned on smaller models and reused on larger ones.

Result: Training acceleration of up to 23%, especially in complex models like MoE, and scalability to models 27x larger.

Conclusion: RLRS offers a practical, scalable solution for optimizing large-scale neural network training.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach for optimizing LLM training by
adjusting learning rates across weights of different components in Transformer
models. Traditional methods often apply a uniform learning rate across all
network layers, potentially overlooking the unique dynamics of each part.
Remarkably, our introduced relative learning rates, RLRS, method accelerates
the training process by up to $23\%$, particularly in complex models such as
Mixture of Experts (MoE). Hyperparameters of RLRS can be efficiently tuned on
smaller models and then effectively reused on models up to $27\times$ larger.
This simple and effective method results in a substantial reduction in training
time and computational resources, offering a practical and scalable solution
for optimizing large-scale neural networks.

TL;DR: A novel framework for generating realistic synthetic relational tabular data with causal relationships across tables, addressing limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic tabular data generation methods fail to handle relational formats with interconnected tables, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: Extends the SCM-based approach to create a framework for generating synthetic relational tabular data with inter-table dependencies.

Result: The framework successfully constructs relational datasets with complex dependencies, mimicking real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances synthetic data generation for relational tabular data, enhancing its utility for foundation models.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has received increasing attention in recent
years, particularly with the emergence of foundation models for tabular data.
The breakthrough success of TabPFN (Hollmann et al.,2025), which leverages vast
quantities of synthetic tabular datasets derived from structural causal models
(SCMs), demonstrates the critical role synthetic data plays in developing
powerful tabular foundation models. However, most real-world tabular data
exists in relational formats spanning multiple interconnected tables - a
structure not adequately addressed by current generation methods. In this work,
we extend the SCM-based approach by developing a novel framework that generates
realistic synthetic relational tabular data including causal relationships
across tables. Our experiments confirm that this framework is able to construct
relational datasets with complex inter-table dependencies mimicking real-world
scenarios.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Federated learning with differential privacy suffers from two major costs:
each client must transmit $d$-dimensional gradients every round, and the
magnitude of DP noise grows with $d$. Yet empirical studies show that gradient
updates exhibit strong temporal correlations and lie in a $k$-dimensional
subspace with $k \ll d$. Motivated by this, we introduce DOME, a decentralized
DP optimization framework in which each client maintains a compact sketch to
project gradients into $\mathbb{R}^k$ before privatization and Secure
Aggregation. This reduces per-round communication from order $d$ to order $k$
and moves towards a gradient approximation mean-squared error of $\sigma^2 k$.
To allow the sketch to span new directions and prevent it from collapsing onto
historical gradients, we augment it with random probes orthogonal to historical
directions. We prove that our overall protocol satisfies
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (SGTK) and Simplified Graph Neural Kernel (SGNK) to reduce computational complexity in graph neural networks while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNTK methods suffer from redundant computations due to layer-stacking, limiting scalability.

Method: Proposes SGTK with continuous $K$-step aggregation and SGNK, modeling infinitely wide GNNs as Gaussian Processes.

Result: SGTK and SGNK achieve comparable performance to existing methods with improved efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer scalable and efficient alternatives to traditional GNTK approaches.

Abstract: The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) successfully bridges the gap between
kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing key challenges such
as the difficulty of training deep networks and the limitations of traditional
kernel methods. However, the existing layer-stacking strategy in GNTK
introduces redundant computations, significantly increasing computational
complexity and limiting scalability for practical applications. To address
these issues, this paper proposes the Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel
(SGTK), which replaces the traditional multi-layer stacking mechanism with a
continuous $K$-step aggregation operation. This novel approach streamlines the
iterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant
calculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness. By reducing the
dependency on layer stacking, SGTK achieves both computational simplicity and
efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce the Simplified Graph Neural Kernel
(SGNK), which models infinitely wide Graph Neural Networks as Gaussian
Processes. This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the
expected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,
bypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further
reduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture
intricate structural patterns in graphs. Extensive experiments on node and
graph classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed SGTK and SGNK achieve
performance comparable to existing approaches while improving computational
efficiency. Implementation details are available at

TL;DR: KLDM introduces a diffusion model for crystalline materials, addressing challenges like symmetries and manifold constraints by coupling coordinates with velocities for effective diffusion on a hypertorus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The data distribution of crystalline materials involves symmetries and multiple modalities, requiring careful handling of fractional coordinates on a hypertorus.

Method: KLDM generalizes Trivialized Diffusion Model (TDM) by coupling coordinates with auxiliary Euclidean velocities, enabling diffusion on a flat space while respecting periodic symmetry.

Result: KLDM shows competitive performance in Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De-novo Generation (DNG) tasks.

Conclusion: KLDM effectively addresses the challenges of generative modeling for crystalline materials, outperforming current state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Generative modeling of crystalline materials using diffusion models presents
a series of challenges: the data distribution is characterized by inherent
symmetries and involves multiple modalities, with some defined on specific
manifolds. Notably, the treatment of fractional coordinates representing atomic
positions in the unit cell requires careful consideration, as they lie on a
hypertorus. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Langevin Diffusion for Materials
(KLDM), a novel diffusion model for crystalline materials generation, where the
key innovation resides in the modeling of the coordinates. Instead of resorting
to Riemannian diffusion on the hypertorus directly, we generalize Trivialized
Diffusion Model (TDM) to account for the symmetries inherent to crystals. By
coupling coordinates with auxiliary Euclidean variables representing
velocities, the diffusion process is now offset to a flat space. This allows us
to effectively perform diffusion on the hypertorus while providing a training
objective that accounts for the periodic translation symmetry of the true data
distribution. We evaluate KLDM on both Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and
De-novo Generation (DNG) tasks, demonstrating its competitive performance with
current state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: A factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework is proposed for deep twin-network models to split predictive variance into representation and prediction uncertainties, offering interpretable uncertainty quantification for treatment-effect estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate treatment-effect estimation requires reliable predictions and interpretable uncertainty, especially in high-stakes applications.

Method: The framework uses factorized Monte Carlo Dropout in deep twin-network models, decomposing variance into representation (sigma_rep) and prediction (sigma_pred) uncertainties.

Result: The method shows well-calibrated intervals (ECE < 0.03) and a crossover effect where representation uncertainty dominates under covariate shift. In real-world data, sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples, becoming the primary error predictor.

Conclusion: The module-level decomposition provides a practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep causal-effect models.

Abstract: Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications
demands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty
quantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep
twin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation
uncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty
(sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift
regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE < 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2
+ sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head
uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty
dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced
multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples
(delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep <=
0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a
practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep
causal-effect models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of discovering governing equations for chaotic systems in physics and neuroscience, especially with limited or noisy data, motivates the development of PEM-UDE.

Method: PEM-UDE integrates prediction-error method with universal differential equations, smoothing optimization landscapes and removing chaotic properties during fitting.

Result: The method recovers hidden states in the Rossler system and noisy electrical circuit data, and derives biologically constrained neural equations validated by intracranial recordings.

Conclusion: PEM-UDE bridges single-neuron dynamics and macroscale brain activity, offering a pathway for multi-scale brain models.

Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains
a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the
PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal
differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from
chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This
approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization
landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process
without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by
recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from
noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of
the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is
corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that
this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct
symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount
of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method
derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as
network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing
yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving
microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent
relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and
synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three
intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex,
prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to
develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse
neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and
macroscale brain activity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies between clinical and omics data by identifying anomalous samples for better disease understanding and early detection.

Method: Uses a three-step workflow: classification (SVM), anomaly detection, and explanation using clinical data and expert knowledge.

Result: Detected 15 anomalous healthy controls with PD-like features and 22 anomalous PD cases with HC-like features, showing significant clinical differences.

Conclusion: MLASDO is effective for detecting and explaining anomalous samples, aiding clinicians in follow-up decisions.

Abstract: Inconsistencies between clinical and omics data may arise within medical
cohorts. The identification, annotation and explanation of anomalous
omics-based patients or individuals may become crucial to better reshape the
disease, e.g., by detecting early onsets signaled by the omics and undetectable
from observable symptoms. Here, we developed MLASDO (Machine Learning based
Anomalous Sample Detection on Omics), a new method and software tool to
identify, characterize and automatically describe anomalous samples based on
omics data. Its workflow is based on three steps: (1) classification of healthy
and cases individuals using a support vector machine algorithm; (2) detection
of anomalous samples within groups; (3) explanation of anomalous individuals
based on clinical data and expert knowledge. We showcase MLASDO using
transcriptomics data of 317 healthy controls (HC) and 465 Parkinson's disease
(PD) cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In this cohort,
MLASDO detected 15 anomalous HC with a PD-like transcriptomic signature and
PD-like clinical features, including a lower proportion of CD4/CD8 naive
T-cells and CD4 memory T-cells compared to HC (P<3.5*10^-3). MLASDO also
identified 22 anomalous PD cases with a transcriptomic signature more similar
to that of HC and some clinical features more similar to HC, including a lower
proportion of mature neutrophils compared to PD cases (P<6*10^-3). In summary,
MLASDO is a powerful tool that can help the clinician to detect and explain
anomalous HC and cases of interest to be followed up. MLASDO is an open-source

TL;DR: The paper evaluates DeepONet variants for multiphysics systems, showing architectural alignment with physical coupling improves performance. Strongly coupled systems favor single-branch networks, while multi-branch excels in decoupled cases. Surrogates are 1.8e4 times faster than solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in neural operator frameworks for multiphysics problems, focusing on learning nonlinear interactions between coupled physical fields.

Method: Benchmark DeepONet and S-DeepONet (GRU-based) with single-branch and multi-branch architectures across single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly coupled multiphysics systems.

Result: Single-branch networks outperform in strongly coupled settings; multi-branch is better for decoupled problems. Surrogates are 1.8e4 times faster than solvers with no accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Architectural alignment with physical coupling is critical for effective neural operator design in multiphysics applications.

Abstract: Scientific applications increasingly demand real-time surrogate models that
can capture the behavior of strongly coupled multiphysics systems driven by
multiple input functions, such as in thermo-mechanical and electro-thermal
processes. While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their
extension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,
the challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled
physical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses
a foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator
reflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we
present the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet
variants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly
coupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with
dual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional
coupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic
thermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient
phase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical
DeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked
using both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our
results demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is
crucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch
counterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer
advantages for decoupled or single-physics problems. Once trained, these
surrogates achieve full-field predictions up to 1.8e4 times faster than
high-fidelity finite-element solvers, without compromising solution accuracy.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs on insecure code erodes prior alignment, revealing shared latent dimensions that degrade safety behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how narrow domain fine-tuning impacts LLM alignment and safety mechanisms.

Method: Analyzed output probabilities, loss/gradient geometry, layer-wise activations, and activation space dimensions.

Result: Fine-tuning on insecure code opposes alignment, activating a shared latent dimension that degrades safety.

Conclusion: Alignment in LLMs is fragile; robust fine-tuning strategies are needed to preserve intended behavior.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code
with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors
across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of
harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we
contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts
the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series
of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient
vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space
dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be
better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning
on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we
identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs
alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and
by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can
degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.
Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed
misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The
results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that
preserve intended behavior across domains.

Attention mechanisms reveal regional interactions, and ensemble strategies improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate electricity forecasting is vital for grid stability, especially in decentralized systems. Classical methods like GAMs lack spatial dependency modeling, motivating the use of GNNs.

Method: Evaluated multiple GNN architectures (GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP, TransformerConv, GAT, GATv2) on real-world datasets from France and the UK. Analyzed attention weights and benchmarked ensemble strategies.

Result: Simpler models (GCN, APPNP) perform well in low-data settings; GAT remains competitive and interpretable. Attention reveals seasonal and regional patterns. Ensembles enhance robustness.

Conclusion: GNNs, especially GAT, are effective for electricity forecasting, offering interpretability and performance. Ensembles further improve results under data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is crucial for ensuring grid
stability and optimizing power generation, particularly in increasingly
decentralized and complex systems. While classical approaches such as
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to
capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural

directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of
GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP,
TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two
real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our
experiments show that while complex architectures like GATv2 and
TransformerConv do not consistently outperform their simpler counterparts,
models such as GCN and APPNP achieve strong results in low-data or highly
disaggregated settings. Nonetheless, the vanilla GAT remains highly competitive
across both datasets and offers an additional interpretability layer via
attention mechanisms. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights,
revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and
meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is
not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial
dependencies are prominent. Finally, we benchmark ensemble-based expert
aggregation strategies, showing that uniform or learned combinations can
enhance robustness and outperform individual models under data heterogeneity.

TL;DR: CosmoBench is a large dataset from cosmological simulations, offering point clouds and directed trees for tasks like predicting cosmological parameters and velocities. Baselines include traditional and machine learning methods, with potential for further improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extract insights from cosmological simulation data and bridge the gap between cosmology and geometric deep learning.

Method: Curated a benchmark dataset (CosmoBench) from simulations, providing baselines using cosmological modeling and machine learning (e.g., linear models, graph neural networks).

Result: Least-squares fits with invariant features sometimes outperform deep learning models, but there's room for improvement by combining both approaches.

Conclusion: CosmoBench enables large-scale collaboration between cosmology and machine learning, inviting the community to advance scientific discovery.

Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds
and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that
shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we
introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours
and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of
its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter
halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand
directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time
scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict
cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the
velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,
and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time
scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established
approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.
For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that
are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more
computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural
networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features
sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far
longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve
these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit
the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep
learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific
discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at

*Yan Katcharovski,Andrew L. Maxwell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores using AI to automate the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA) for startup funding decisions, achieving high accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the resource-intensive and subjective nature of business angel funding decisions by leveraging AI.

Method: Used LLMs to assign CFA factors to 600 startup pitches, then trained ML models on these scores.

Result: Achieved 85.0% predictive accuracy and strong correlation with human evaluations.

Conclusion: AI can effectively automate CFA, making it scalable and less biased for startup evaluations.

Abstract: External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology
startups that require significant R&D investment. Business angels offer a
critical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and
resource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has
investigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels
consider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more
than 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated
post-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own
decisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals
and several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work
validating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its
adoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we
prompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors
to a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business
angel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated
machine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as
input features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy
(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant
correlation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional
human-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a
structured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,
reliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the
constraints that previously limited adoption.

*Abdennacer Badaoui,Oussama Kharouiche,Hatim Mrabet,Daniele Malitesta,Fragkiskos D. Malliaros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAROS is a novel framework for fair graph generation by switching sensitive attributes during the generation process of pre-trained GDMs, balancing accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring fairness in graph diffusion models (GDMs) is a challenge, as existing methods rely on re-training with fairness constraints. FAROS addresses this by directly modifying the generation process.

Method: FAROS alters nodes' sensitive attributes during generation, calculating the optimal fraction of switching nodes and selecting diffusion steps with multi-criteria constraints to balance accuracy and fairness.

Result: Experiments show FAROS reduces fairness discrepancies while maintaining or improving accuracy, outperforming baselines in accuracy-fairness trade-offs under Pareto optimality.

Conclusion: FAROS effectively balances fairness and accuracy in graph generation, demonstrating the success of its multi-criteria constraints.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph diffusion models (GDMs) have enabled the
synthesis of realistic network structures, yet ensuring fairness in the
generated data remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions attempt to
mitigate bias by re-training the GDMs with ad-hoc fairness constraints.
Conversely, with this work, we propose FAROS, a novel FAir graph geneRatiOn
framework leveraging attribute Switching mechanisms and directly running in the
generation process of the pre-trained GDM. Technically, our approach works by
altering nodes' sensitive attributes during the generation. To this end, FAROS
calculates the optimal fraction of switching nodes, and selects the diffusion
step to perform the switch by setting tailored multi-criteria constraints to
preserve the node-topology profile from the original distribution (a proxy for
accuracy) while ensuring the edge independence on the sensitive attributes for
the generated graph (a proxy for fairness). Our experiments on benchmark
datasets for link prediction demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively
reduces fairness discrepancies while maintaining comparable (or even higher)
accuracy performance to other similar baselines. Noteworthy, FAROS is also able
to strike a better accuracy-fairness trade-off than other competitors in some
of the tested settings under the Pareto optimality concept, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the imposed multi-criteria constraints.

*Magda Dubois,Harry Coppock,Mario Giulianelli,Lennart Luettgau,Cozmin Ududec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bayesian GLM framework is proposed to assess LLM autograders, addressing biases and improving reliability in LLM evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autograders (LLM-as-a-judge) are scalable but unreliable and biased; a robust statistical method is needed to evaluate and mitigate these issues.

Method: Uses Bayesian generalized linear models (GLMs) to model evaluation outcomes, considering grader and item properties for bias quantification.

Result: The framework provides uncertainty estimates, clarifies disagreement sources, and detects biases, enhancing autograder reliability.

Conclusion: The approach improves interpretability and robustness in LLM evaluation, supporting performance analysis and bias detection.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly
performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or
autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human
evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic
biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity,
and other factors. In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on
Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to
simultaneously assess their autograders while also addressing their primary
research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation
outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of
the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response
length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of
scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In
addition, our method can be used to augment traditional reliability metrics
such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and
clarifying the source of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to
more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling
both performance analysis and bias detection.

TL;DR: GNN-Ceff, a GNN-based method for post-layout effective capacitance modeling, offers speed and accuracy improvements over current heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timing analysis in VLSI design relies on placement and routing, which in turn depend on timing performance. Early-stage timing prediction can enhance design efficiency.

Method: Proposes GNN-Ceff, a GNN-based model for effective capacitance modeling, leveraging GPU parallelization for speed.

Result: Achieves 929x speedup over state-of-the-art methods while improving accuracy.

Conclusion: GNN-Ceff is a promising solution for efficient and accurate timing analysis in VLSI design.

Abstract: Static timing analysis is a crucial stage in the VLSI design flow that
verifies the timing correctness of circuits. Timing analysis depends on the
placement and routing of the design, but at the same time, placement and
routing efficiency depend on the final timing performance. VLSI design flows
can benefit from timing-related prediction to better perform the earlier stages
of the design flow. Effective capacitance is an essential input for gate delay
calculation, and finding exact values requires routing or routing estimates. In
this work, we propose the first GNN-based post-layout effective capacitance
modeling method, GNN-Ceff, that achieves significant speed gains due to GPU
parallelization while also providing better accuracy than current heuristics.
GNN-Ceff parallelization achieves 929x speedup on real-life benchmarks over the
state-of-the-art method run serially.

*Md Mokarram Chowdhury,Daniel Agyei Asante,Ernie Chang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IMPACT is a framework for importance-aware activation reconstruction in LLMs, optimizing compression by considering activation structure and gradient sensitivity, achieving significant size reduction without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are large and hard to deploy in resource-constrained settings. Traditional low-rank weight compression assumes low-rank weights, but LLM activations show stronger low-rank structure, prompting a focus on activation reconstruction.

Method: IMPACT formulates an optimization problem considering activation structure and gradient sensitivity, deriving a closed-form solution using eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix.

Result: IMPACT achieves up to 48.6% greater model size reduction with comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: IMPACT provides a principled approach to LLM compression by focusing on activation reconstruction, balancing size reduction and accuracy preservation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many domains
but are difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings due to their size.
Low-rank weight matrix compression is a popular strategy for reducing model
size, typically by minimizing weight reconstruction error under the assumption
that weights are low-rank. However, this assumption often does not hold in
LLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a
shift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.
  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions
contribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm
performance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware
activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their
impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that
considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a
closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the
eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This
enables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy.
Experiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to
48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
baselines.

*Sungyoon Kim,Rajat Vadiraj Dwaraknath,Longling geng,Mert Pilanci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MatRL is a reinforcement learning framework for automatically designing iterative algorithms to compute matrix functions, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-tuning iterative methods for matrix functions is complex and time-consuming, especially with numerous variants and parameters.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning (Monte-Carlo tree search) to design hybrid sequences of matrix iterations and step sizes tailored to input distributions.

Result: Learned algorithms generalize to larger matrices from the same distribution and outperform existing baselines.

Conclusion: MatRL effectively automates and optimizes iterative algorithm design for matrix functions, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Iterative methods for computing matrix functions have been extensively
studied and their convergence speed can be significantly improved with the
right tuning of parameters and by mixing different iteration types. Handtuning
the design options for optimal performance can be cumbersome, especially in
modern computing environments: numerous different classical iterations and
their variants exist, each with non-trivial per-step cost and tuning
parameters. To this end, we propose MatRL -- a reinforcement learning based
framework that automatically discovers iterative algorithms for computing
matrix functions. The key idea is to treat algorithm design as a sequential
decision-making process. Monte-Carlo tree search is then used to plan a hybrid
sequence of matrix iterations and step sizes, tailored to a specific input
matrix distribution and computing environment. Moreover, we also show that the
learned algorithms provably generalize to sufficiently large matrices drawn
from the same distribution. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results
with numerical experiments demonstrating that MatRL produces algorithms that
outperform various baselines in the literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable electronic structure prediction for large materials with extended defects or disorder, overcoming GPU memory constraints of densely connected graphs.

Method: Developed a distributed eGNN using direct GPU communication and graph partitioning to minimize embedding exchanges between GPUs.

Result: Achieved strong scaling up to 128 GPUs and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% efficiency for structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms.

Conclusion: The distributed eGNN implementation efficiently handles large-scale electronic structure prediction, making it feasible for complex material systems.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional
theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at
unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of
materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases.
However, as interactions between atomic orbitals typically extend over 10+
angstroms, the graph representations required for this task tend to be densely
connected, and the memory requirements to perform training and inference on
these large structures can exceed the limits of modern GPUs. Here we present a
distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and
introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of
embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to
128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for
structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.

*Chi-Ken Lu,David Alonge,Nicole Richardson,Bruno Richard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reducing ICD-10 code granularity in OLS models improves accuracy and coefficient stability without sacrificing interpretability or discarding predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretable cost models in healthcare often struggle with accuracy and parameter consistency, especially when using granular ICD-10 codes.

Method: Truncate ICD-10 codes from seven to six or fewer characters to reduce dimensionality while preserving diagnostic categories in OLS models.

Result: Lower granularity increases the trace of the Hessian matrix, reducing coefficient variance and improving stability.

Conclusion: Broader diagnostic groupings (e.g., DRGs, HCC codes) are preferred over granular ICD-10 codes for stable and interpretable cost models.

Abstract: Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy,
and parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to
achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for
high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable
regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic
codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are
infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge
can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we
demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective
regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all
diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters
(e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the
dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model
interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in
OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance
of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic
groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes
in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.

Motivation: Existing deep learning methods in quantum chemistry are limited to neutral, closed-shell molecules, ignoring real-world complexities like charges, spins, and environments.

Method: OrbitAll combines spin-polarized orbital features with SE(3)-equivariant graph neural networks to handle arbitrary molecular characteristics.

Result: OrbitAll outperforms competitors, achieving chemical accuracy with 10x less data and a speedup of 10^3-10^4 over density functional theory.

Conclusion: OrbitAll provides a robust, physics-informed solution for representing diverse molecular systems efficiently and accurately.

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning methods in quantum chemistry, their
representational capacity is most often confined to neutral, closed-shell

OrbitAll utilizes spin-polarized orbital features from the underlying quantum

molecular system with arbitrary charges, spins, and environmental effects.
OrbitAll demonstrates superior performance and generalization on predicting
charged, open-shell, and solvated molecules, while also robustly extrapolating
to molecules significantly larger than the training data by leveraging a
physics-informed architecture. OrbitAll achieves chemical accuracy using 10
times fewer training data than competing AI models, with a speedup of
approximately $10^3$ - $10^4$ compared to density functional theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance FxLMS for active noise control by leveraging prior knowledge of noise source regions and low-dimensional manifolds of filter weights.

Method: Train an auto-encoder on steady-state filter coefficients, constrain adaptive filter weights to decoder outputs, and update in latent space.

Result: Latent FxLMS converges faster than standard FxLMS with comparable steady-state error under certain conditions.

Conclusion: Latent FxLMS offers a promising approach for improving ANC efficiency by exploiting low-dimensional manifolds and neural network constraints.

Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC),
wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior
knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could
improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible
adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of
the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from
a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be
the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we
perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the
cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and
normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean
squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in
fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting spatiotemporal dynamics on irregular domains is challenging due to complex spatial correlations and nonlinear temporal dynamics.

Method: TK-GCN uses a Koopman-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN) for spatial encoding and a Transformer for temporal modeling, leveraging Koopman theory and self-attention.

Result: TK-GCN achieves superior predictive accuracy in cardiac dynamics forecasting, outperforming baselines across various horizons.

Conclusion: TK-GCN effectively models complex spatial structures and nonlinear temporal dynamics, demonstrating its robustness for spatiotemporal forecasting.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics forecasting is inherently challenging, particularly
in systems defined over irregular geometric domains, due to the need to jointly
capture complex spatial correlations and nonlinear temporal dynamics. To tackle
these challenges, we propose TK-GCN, a two-stage framework that integrates
geometry-aware spatial encoding with long-range temporal modeling. In the first
stage, a Koopman-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN) is developed to
embed the high-dimensional dynamics distributed on spatially irregular domains
into a latent space where the evolution of system states is approximately
linear. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, this stage enhances the temporal
consistency during the latent learning. In the second stage, a Transformer
module is employed to model the temporal progression within the Koopman-encoded
latent space. Through the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer captures
long-range temporal dependencies, enabling accurate forecasting over extended
horizons. We evaluate TK-GCN in spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics forecasting and
benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results and ablation studies show that TK-GCN consistently
delivers superior predictive accuracy across a range of forecast horizons,
demonstrating its capability to effectively model complex spatial structures
and nonlinear temporal dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes higher-order Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving ODEs with parametric uncertainties, combining symbolic differentiation and Taylor series to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs degrade in accuracy for families of ODEs with varying parameters and initial conditions, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: Higher-order models are introduced, using symbolic Lie derivatives and Taylor series expansions, with a neural network modeling the remainder term as a solution to a first-order ODE.

Result: The proposed higher-order PINNs demonstrate improved accuracy on challenging ODE benchmarks and prove useful for controlling uncertain physical systems.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances PINN accuracy for ODEs with parametric uncertainties, offering practical applications in uncertain system control.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning neural network models for Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) with parametric uncertainties. Such neural
network models capture the solution to the ODE over a given set of parameters,
initial conditions, and range of times. Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning such models that
combine data-driven deep learning with symbolic physics models in a principled
manner. However, the accuracy of PINNs degrade when they are used to solve an
entire family of initial value problems characterized by varying parameters and
initial conditions.
  In this paper, we combine symbolic differentiation and Taylor series methods
to propose a class of higher-order models for capturing the solutions to ODEs.
These models combine neural networks and symbolic terms: they use higher order
Lie derivatives and a Taylor series expansion obtained symbolically, with the
remainder term modeled as a neural network. The key insight is that the
remainder term can itself be modeled as a solution to a first-order ODE. We
show how the use of these higher order PINNs can improve accuracy using
interesting, but challenging ODE benchmarks. We also show that the resulting
model can be quite useful for situations such as controlling uncertain physical
systems modeled as ODEs.

TL;DR: A deep ensemble framework is proposed to reduce error accumulation in ML surrogates for PDE systems, improving long-term prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive ML models for PDE systems suffer from error accumulation, limiting their long-term accuracy.

Method: Multiple ML surrogate models with random initializations are trained in parallel and aggregated during inference to leverage prediction diversity.

Result: The framework reduces error accumulation in three PDE-driven systems, enabling faster and accurate full trajectory predictions.

Conclusion: Ensemble methods offer robust, efficient, and accurate alternatives to traditional PDE solvers.

Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require
computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field
evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions,
autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over
successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep
ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate
models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and
aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model
predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive
strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We
validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution
in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and
planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in
error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the
method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory
predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers.
Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical
systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to
traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub

Method: A data-domain sampling regime analyzing 16M trials from 800 CNNs and 6,825 trials from 113 humans, focusing on sensitivity, stability, and expertise.

Result: CNNs outperform humans, with biases dependent on training-test distribution discrepancies.

Conclusion: CNNs exhibit simple, elegant behavior in interpreting visualization images, with performance tied to training-test distance.

Abstract: We present a data-domain sampling regime for quantifying CNNs' graphic
perception behaviors. This regime lets us evaluate CNNs' ratio estimation
ability in bar charts from three perspectives: sensitivity to training-test
distribution discrepancies, stability to limited samples, and relative
expertise to human observers. After analyzing 16 million trials from 800 CNNs
models and 6,825 trials from 113 human participants, we arrived at a simple and
actionable conclusion: CNNs can outperform humans and their biases simply
depend on the training-test distance. We show evidence of this simple, elegant
behavior of the machines when they interpret visualization images. osf.io/gfqc3

### [186] [Enhancing Adaptive Behavioral Interventions with LLM Inference from Participant-Described States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03871)
*Karine Karine,Benjamin M. Marlin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using natural language descriptions and LLMs to expand the state space in RL-based health interventions without sacrificing data efficiency, improving policy learning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity in RL applications for health behavior change by leveraging natural language and LLMs to enhance state descriptions.

Method: Participants provide natural language state descriptions; LLMs infer and align these with RL policies. A simulation environment with an auxiliary LLM generates text-based states for evaluation.

Result: The approach shows potential to significantly improve online policy learning methods in health interventions.

Conclusion: Expanding state space with natural language and LLMs can enhance RL-based health interventions without compromising data efficiency.

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior
change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of
significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on
problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion.
However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection
of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that
arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials.
In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state
space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The
proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language
descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference
with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a
base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we
develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that
generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables
using an auxiliary LLM. We show that this approach has the potential to
significantly improve the performance of online policy learning methods.

*Shengjian Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks' generalization is linked to dynamic mapping of datasets to local extrema, with extrema count tied to parameters. A new extremum-increment algorithm addresses issues like gradient vanishing and overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify neural networks' generalization and address challenges like gradient vanishing and overfitting by exploring local extrema dynamics.

Method: Proposes the extremum-increment algorithm as an alternative to back-propagation, leveraging the correlation between local extrema and parameters.

Result: Demonstrates that the extremum-increment algorithm can handle gradient vanishing and overfitting effectively.

Conclusion: Neural networks' generalization is explainable via local extrema, and the new algorithm offers a viable solution to common training issues.

Abstract: We point out that neural networks are not black boxes, and their
generalization stems from the ability to dynamically map a dataset to the local
extrema of the model function. We further prove that the number of local
extrema in a neural network is positively correlated with the number of its
parameters, and on this basis, we give a new algorithm that is different from
the back-propagation algorithm, which we call the extremum-increment algorithm.
Some difficult situations, such as gradient vanishing and overfitting, can be
reasonably explained and dealt with in this framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI) is a framework for causal and predictive inference using unstructured data, leveraging GenAI models without fine-tuning for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable causal and predictive inference from unstructured data (text, images) using generative AI models in a computationally efficient way.

Method: Uses open-source GenAI models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models) to generate and extract low-dimensional representations from unstructured data, applying ML for estimation and uncertainty quantification.

Result: Demonstrated in three applications: social media censorship analysis, electoral outcome prediction from facial appearance, and political rhetoric persuasiveness assessment.

Conclusion: GPI is versatile, efficient, and accessible, with an open-source implementation available.

Abstract: We introduce GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI), a statistical framework for both
causal and predictive inference using unstructured data, including text and
images. GPI leverages open-source Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)
models - such as large language models and diffusion models - not only to
generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional
representations that capture their underlying structure. Applying machine
learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and
predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike
existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require
fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and
broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through
three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2)
estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral
outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An
open-source software package is available for implementing GPI.

*Mahdi Moghaddami,Clayton Schubring,Mohammad-Reza Siadat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer model is proposed for predicting Alzheimer's disease progression stages, outperforming RNNs and handling missing data effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of AD is crucial for intervention, but existing methods struggle with missing data and identifying disease progression.

Method: A Transformer model is developed to predict AD stages using sequential visit data, compared against RNN variants (LSTM, GRU, minimalRNN).

Result: The model excels in predictive performance, especially for converter subjects, despite missing visits or features.

Conclusion: The Transformer model shows promise for improving early AD diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure
that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is
critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the
disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage
of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a
sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also
rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess
their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data
imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit
history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model
optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly
in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe
disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal
prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early
diagnosis and patient outcomes.

*Mehrdad Moghimi,Hyejin Ku*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework optimizes Spectral Risk Measures (SRM) for risk-sensitive RL, outperforming existing methods in online and offline settings with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive integration of risk measures in DRL often leads to suboptimal policies, especially in critical scenarios where worst-case outcomes are severe.

Method: Proposes a framework for optimizing static SRM, applicable to online and offline RL, with theoretical convergence proofs.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the method outperforms existing risk-sensitive approaches in diverse domains.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the limitations of naive risk measure integration, offering tailored risk preferences and superior performance.

Abstract: The development of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has introduced
a natural way to incorporate risk sensitivity into value-based and actor-critic
methods by employing risk measures other than expectation in the value
function. While this approach is widely adopted in many online and offline RL
algorithms due to its simplicity, the naive integration of risk measures often
results in suboptimal policies. This limitation can be particularly harmful in
scenarios where the need for effective risk-sensitive policies is critical and
worst-case outcomes carry severe consequences. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel framework for optimizing static Spectral Risk Measures (SRM), a
flexible family of risk measures that generalizes objectives such as CVaR and
Mean-CVaR, and enables the tailoring of risk preferences. Our method is
applicable to both online and offline RL algorithms. We establish theoretical
guarantees by proving convergence in the finite state-action setting. Moreover,
through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithms
consistently outperform existing risk-sensitive methods in both online and
offline environments across diverse domains.

*Henry B. Moss,Sebastian W. Ober,Tom Diethe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decoupled approach combining VAE and GP for Bayesian optimization in complex domains like molecular space improves performance under constrained budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods tightly couple surrogate and generative models, leading to suboptimal performance when latent spaces aren't task-specific.

Method: Train a VAE and GP separately, then combine them via a principled Bayesian update rule.

Result: The decoupled approach enhances identification of high-potential candidates in molecular optimization.

Conclusion: Separating generative and predictive models leverages their strengths, improving optimization efficiency.

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation in the latent space of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)
is a powerful framework for optimisation tasks over complex structured domains,
such as the space of scientifically interesting molecules. However, existing
approaches tightly couple the surrogate and generative models, which can lead
to suboptimal performance when the latent space is not tailored to specific
tasks, which in turn has led to the proposal of increasingly sophisticated
algorithms. In this work, we explore a new direction, instead proposing a
decoupled approach that trains a generative model and a Gaussian Process (GP)
surrogate separately, then combines them via a simple yet principled Bayesian
update rule. This separation allows each component to focus on its strengths --
structure generation from the VAE and predictive modelling by the GP. We show
that our decoupled approach improves our ability to identify high-potential
candidates in molecular optimisation problems under constrained evaluation
budgets.

*Shubin Ma,Liang Zhao,Mingdong Lu,Yifan Guo,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAPIMAC addresses incomplete and misaligned multimodal data using self-repellent greedy anchor search and consistency-aware padding, improving fusion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle imbalanced and misaligned multimodal data, leading to poor data fusion quality.

Method: Proposes SRGASM for anchor point identification and CAPM for data interpolation and alignment using noise-contrastive learning.

Result: Superior performance on benchmark datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CAPIMAC effectively fills and aligns imbalanced multimodal data, enhancing fusion quality.

Abstract: Multimodal representation is faithful and highly effective in describing
real-world data samples' characteristics by describing their complementary
information. However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and
misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor
frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively
addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data
are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment
of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being
well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we
propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment
Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the
problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.
Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),
which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to
identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal
data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a
consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align
imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal
data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method
over benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly released at
https://github.com/Autism-mm/CAPIMAC.git.

*Jianshen Zhu,Naveed Ahmed Azam,Kazuya Haraguchi,Liang Zhao,Tatsuya Akutsu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces mol-infer-GNN, a framework combining MILP and GNN for chemical compound inference, improving learning performance over traditional feature-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for chemical compound inference rely on feature vectors, limiting learning performance. GNNs offer better performance by directly using chemical graphs, motivating the integration of GNN into the mol-infer framework.

Method: The proposed mol-infer-GNN framework uses GNN for learning while retaining the flexibility of MILP for abstract structure inference. Computational experiments on the QM9 dataset validate its performance.

Result: The GNN model achieves good learning performance for some properties and can infer small chemical graphs (up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms) efficiently.

Conclusion: mol-infer-GNN successfully combines GNN and MILP, offering improved learning performance and practical inference capabilities for chemical compounds.

Abstract: Recently, a novel two-phase framework named mol-infer for inference of
chemical compounds with prescribed abstract structures and desired property
values has been proposed. The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using
mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process
of machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient
conditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches
usually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors
to construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of
descriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation,
the learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A
lack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred
chemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great
importance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising
machine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input,
and many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction
problem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to
the traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors. In this study, we
develop a molecular inference framework based on mol-infer, namely
mol-infer-GNN, that utilizes GNN as the learning method while keeping the great
flexibility originated from the two-layered model on the abstract structure of
the chemical graph to be inferred. We conducted computational experiments on
the QM9 dataset to show that our proposed GNN model can obtain satisfying
learning performances for some properties despite its simple structure, and can
infer small chemical graphs comprising up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms within
reasonable computational time.

### [194] [MCST-Mamba: Multivariate Mamba-Based Model for Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03927)
*Mohamed Hamad,Mohamed Mabrok,Nizar Zorba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCST-Mamba, a model for multivariate traffic prediction, addressing limitations of existing methods by jointly modeling all traffic features with improved spatio-temporal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation but is challenging due to dynamic conditions and interrelated data. Existing methods often fail to capture joint patterns across traffic features.

Method: Proposes MCST-Mamba, a framework using selective state-space architecture to handle multivariate inputs, with dedicated blocks for temporal and spatial modeling.

Result: MCST-Mamba shows strong predictive performance with fewer parameters compared to baselines, evaluated across all traffic features.

Conclusion: The model effectively addresses multivariate traffic prediction challenges, offering practical benefits for congestion management.

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation
systems by enabling efficient routing, congestion mitigation, and proactive
traffic control. However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined
effects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different
locations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data
often consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and
occupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these
variables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to
capture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the
Multi-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built
on the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles
multivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The
proposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and
separates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions
into two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike
prior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across
all traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises
in practice. Our results show that MCST-Mamba achieves strong predictive
performance with a lower parameter count compared to baseline models.

Motivation: To systematically compare traditional rule-based and modern deep learning approaches for link prediction in knowledge graphs and improve performance with a new model.

Method: Introduces GCAT, a graph neural network using multi-head attention for context aggregation and interaction between heterogeneous nodes.

Result: GCAT outperforms rule-based methods and achieves competitive or superior performance to existing neural models on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Attention-based architectures like GCAT are effective for capturing complex relational patterns in knowledge graph completion.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs offer a structured representation of real-world entities and
their relationships, enabling a wide range of applications from information
retrieval to automated reasoning. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
comparison between traditional rule-based approaches and modern deep learning
methods for link prediction. We focus on KBGAT, a graph neural network model
that leverages multi-head attention to jointly encode both entity and relation
features within local neighborhood structures. To advance this line of
research, we introduce \textbf{GCAT} (Graph Collaborative Attention Network), a
refined model that enhances context aggregation and interaction between
heterogeneous nodes. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmark
datasets demonstrate that GCAT not only consistently outperforms rule-based
methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
existing neural embedding models. Our findings highlight the advantages of
attention-based architectures in capturing complex relational patterns for
knowledge graph completion tasks.

Result: Real-TabPFN achieves significant performance gains on 29 OpenML AutoML Benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Targeted pre-training on real-world data significantly improves model performance over synthetic or broader corpora.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data, like TabPFN, achieve strong performance
on small datasets when pre-trained solely on synthetic data. We show that this
performance can be significantly boosted by a targeted continued pre-training
phase. Specifically, we demonstrate that leveraging a small, curated collection
of large, real-world datasets for continued pre-training yields superior
downstream predictive accuracy compared to using broader, potentially noisier
corpora like CommonCrawl or GitTables. Our resulting model, Real-TabPFN,
achieves substantial performance gains on 29 datasets from the OpenML AutoML

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quickly and efficiently detect sensor anomalies in chemistry and biology laboratories with minimal data and edge deployment.

Method: Uses a custom PCB for sensor data capture and an Attention-based One-Class Autoencoder trained on 30 minutes of normal data. Model is converted to a TensorFlow-Lite binary for edge deployment.

Result: Achieves F1 score of 0.72, precision of 0.89, and recall of 0.61 on synthetic anomalies. Runs on edge devices with low latency (<2s).

Conclusion: The pipeline is efficient, adaptable, and suitable for quick deployment in lab environments.

Abstract: A lightweight, edge-deployable pipeline is proposed for detecting sensor
anomalies in chemistry and biology laboratories. A custom PCB captures seven
sensor channels and streams them over the local network. An Attention-based
One-Class Autoencoder reaches a usable state after training on only thirty
minutes of normal data. Despite the small data set, the model already attains
an F1 score of 0.72, a precision of 0.89, and a recall of 0.61 when tested on
synthetic micro-anomalies. The trained network is converted into a
TensorFlow-Lite binary of about 31 kB and runs on an Advantech ARK-1221L, a
fan-less x86 edge device without AVX instructions; end-to-end inference latency
stays below two seconds. The entire collect-train-deploy workflow finishes
within one hour, which demonstrates that the pipeline adapts quickly whenever a

TL;DR: The paper introduces tree-based positional embeddings for transformers to better represent hierarchical structures in source code, improving the CodeBERTa model's performance in tasks like MLM and clone detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional positional embeddings in transformers fail to capture the hierarchical structure of source code (ASTs), limiting their effectiveness in code representation tasks.

Method: Proposes a novel tree-based positional embedding method, encoding node depth and sibling indices from ASTs, and integrates it into the CodeBERTa transformer model.

Result: The Tree-Enhanced CodeBERTa outperforms the baseline in MLM pretraining and clone detection, showing improvements in loss, accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.

Conclusion: Incorporating explicit structural information (hierarchical relationships) into transformer models enhances their performance in source code representation tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated significant success in various
source code representation tasks. Nonetheless, traditional positional
embeddings employed by these models inadequately capture the hierarchical
structure intrinsic to source code, typically represented as Abstract Syntax
Trees (ASTs). To address this, we propose a novel tree-based positional
embedding approach that explicitly encodes hierarchical relationships derived
from ASTs, including node depth and sibling indices. These hierarchical
embeddings are integrated into the transformer architecture, specifically
enhancing the CodeBERTa model. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed model
through masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining and clone detection
fine-tuning tasks. Experimental results indicate that our Tree-Enhanced
CodeBERTa consistently surpasses the baseline model in terms of loss, accuracy,
F1 score, precision, and recall, emphasizing the importance of incorporating
explicit structural information into transformer-based representations of
source code.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using commute networks from census data for urban socioeconomic modeling, leveraging deep learning to outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban modeling often ignores network-based effects, despite their prevalence in urban systems.

Method: Uses commute networks and deep learning (Graph Neural Network and Vanilla Neural Network) for socioeconomic modeling.

Result: Outperforms conventional machine learning models in 12 U.S. cities.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for incorporating network effects in urban modeling, aiding policymaking.

Abstract: Urban socioeconomic modeling has predominantly concentrated on extensive
location and neighborhood-based features, relying on the localized population
footprint. However, networks in urban systems are common, and many urban
modeling methods don't account for network-based effects. In this study, we
propose using commute information records from the census as a reliable and
comprehensive source to construct mobility networks across cities. Leveraging
deep learning architectures, we employ these commute networks across U.S. metro
areas for socioeconomic modeling. We show that mobility network structures
provide significant predictive performance without considering any node
features. Consequently, we use mobility networks to present a supervised
learning framework to model a city's socioeconomic indicator directly,
combining Graph Neural Network and Vanilla Neural Network models to learn all
parameters in a single learning pipeline. Our experiments in 12 major U.S.
cities show the proposed model outperforms previous conventional machine
learning models. This work provides urban researchers methods to incorporate
network effects in urban modeling and informs stakeholders of wider
network-based effects in urban policymaking and planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate effluent temperature prediction is crucial for optimizing SAT processes, as temperature affects water viscosity and infiltration rates.

Method: Used MLR, NN, and RF models to predict effluent temperature, evaluating their accuracy and interpretability. MLR was selected for its simplicity and performance.

Result: MLR achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.86-0.87), identified seasonal temperature cycles, and emphasized topsoil temperature's role.

Conclusion: The study offers practical equations for real-time monitoring and long-term SAT planning, with MLR as the preferred model.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of effluent temperature in recharge basins is essential

and evaluates predictive models for effluent temperature in the upper recharge
layer of a Shafdan SAT system recharge basin using ambient meteorological data.
Multiple linear regression (MLR), neural networks (NN), and random forests (RF)
were tested for their predictive accuracy and interpretability. The MLR model,
preferred for its operational simplicity and robust performance, achieved high
predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.86-0.87) and was used to estimate effluent
temperatures over a 10-year period. Results highlight pronounced seasonal
temperature cycles and the importance of topsoil temperature in governing the
thermal profile of the infiltrating effluent. The study provides practical

*Chenyang Ren,Yifan Jia,Huanyi Xie,Zhaobin Xu,Tianxing Wei,Liangyu Wang,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two data valuation methods for Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) to address challenges like noisy data and privacy, improving accuracy and efficiency in data assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns in SAM necessitate accurate data attribution methods, which existing tools like influence functions (IF) fail to address due to SAM's bilevel structure.

Method: The authors develop two IF-based data valuation methods for SAM: Hessian-based IF (closed-form measure) and Gradient Trajectory-based IF (uses gradient trajectory).

Result: Experiments show both methods effectively evaluate data and tune parameters, aiding in tasks like identifying mislabeled data and enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer practical solutions for data valuation in SAM, addressing its unique challenges and improving model performance.

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale
model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However,
challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as
significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of
specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly
rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions
(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to
find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then
minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this
bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.
In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation
methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the
Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a
comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that
relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM
utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and
efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their
effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in
identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

*Maxime Burchi,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMERALD introduces a spatial latent state with MaskGIT predictions to improve world modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Crafter benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Dreamer algorithm's compressed latent space loses crucial information, and existing solutions like Δ-IRIS and DIAMOND are inefficient. EMERALD aims to address these limitations.

Method: EMERALD uses a spatial latent state with MaskGIT predictions for accurate trajectory generation in latent space.

Result: EMERALD surpasses human expert performance on the Crafter benchmark within 10M steps and unlocks all 22 achievements.

Conclusion: EMERALD offers an efficient and accurate alternative to existing world modeling methods, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across
diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated
trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space
can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's
performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this
limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods
require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency
and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned
by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world
modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient
MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent
state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent
space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD
achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass
human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also
succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes relational inductive biases in attention mechanisms, classifying them based on equivariance properties under permutation subgroups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how attention mechanisms generalize by characterizing their relational inductive biases.

Method: Analyze common attention mechanisms using geometric deep learning, focusing on equivariance properties with respect to permutation subgroups.

Result: Different attention layers assume specific underlying relationships on input data, revealing their relational biases.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms can be classified by their relational biases, providing insights into their generalization behavior.

Abstract: Inductive learning aims to construct general models from specific examples,
guided by biases that influence hypothesis selection and determine
generalization capacity. In this work, we focus on characterizing the
relational inductive biases present in attention mechanisms, understood as
assumptions about the underlying relationships between data elements. From the
perspective of geometric deep learning, we analyze the most common attention
mechanisms in terms of their equivariance properties with respect to
permutation subgroups, which allows us to propose a classification based on
their relational biases. Under this perspective, we show that different
attention layers are characterized by the underlying relationships they assume
on the input data.

### [206] [When Data-Free Knowledge Distillation Meets Non-Transferable Teacher: Escaping Out-of-Distribution Trap is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04119)
*Ziming Hong,Runnan Chen,Zengmao Wang,Bo Han,Bo Du,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) with untrusted teachers, proposing Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to filter out misleading OOD samples and improve ID knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFKD methods assume trustworthy teachers, leaving robustness and security concerns unexplored. This work addresses the issue of non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers diverting attention to OOD knowledge.

Method: Proposes ATEsc, which splits synthetic samples into ID-like (fragile) and OOD-like (robust) groups based on adversarial robustness. ID-like samples are used for normal distillation, while OOD-like samples are used to forget OOD knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments show ATEsc effectively improves DFKD against NTL teachers by prioritizing ID knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: ATEsc mitigates the negative impact of NTL teachers in DFKD, enhancing robustness and security in knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common
solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a
substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers
are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted
teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation
into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the
transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is
prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's
attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This
hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit
DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,
inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness
on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups
according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and
used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as
OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.

*Jiaxin Qi,Yan Cui,Jinli Ou,Jianqiang Huang,Gaogang Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores substituting Transformers with GNNs in position-agnostic tasks like single-cell transcriptomics, showing GNNs perform competitively with less computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that Transformers are always optimal by comparing their capabilities with GNNs, especially in tasks where relative positions are irrelevant.

Method: Analyzes similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers, designs a synthetic example to show their equivalence without relative positions, and tests on single-cell transcriptomics data.

Result: GNNs achieve competitive performance to Transformers in position-agnostic tasks while using fewer computational resources.

Conclusion: GNNs can be a viable alternative to Transformers in fields like single-cell transcriptomics, challenging the dominance of Transformers in such scenarios.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities
in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of
interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared
to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage
dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships,
thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training.
However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no
longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in
some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first
explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers,
specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a
synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative
positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell
transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to
Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings
provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell
transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is
always the optimum choice.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probability score for Tsetlin Machine (TM) predictions and new uncertainty quantification techniques to enhance explainability. It demonstrates the score's connection to data probabilities and contrasts TM behavior with neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the transparency and explainability of TM predictions by introducing a probability score and uncertainty quantification techniques.

Method: Derives a probability score from TM learning dynamics, uses simulated data for validation, and applies the techniques to CIFAR-10 image classification.

Result: The probability score aligns with underlying data probabilities, and TM shows reduced confidence outside training domains, unlike neural networks.

Conclusion: The techniques enhance TM explainability and provide insights for improving TM models, particularly in image classification.

Abstract: Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical
rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a
combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and
it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we
present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for
uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The
probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived
through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show
a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying
probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also
reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training
data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in
Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the
uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the
CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible
improvements to current TM image classification models.

Conclusion: JAX-MPM is a scalable, unified platform for differentiable meshfree simulation and data-driven geomechanical inference.

Abstract: Differentiable programming that enables automatic differentiation through

general-purpose differentiable meshfree solver within a hybrid
Lagrangian-Eulerian framework, tailored for simulating complex continuum
mechanics involving large deformations, frictional contact, and inelastic
material behavior, with emphasis on geomechanics and geophysical hazard
applications. Built on the material point method (MPM) and implemented using
the JAX computing framework, JAX-MPM is fully differentiable and
GPU-accelerated, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization directly
through time-stepping solvers. It supports joint training of physical models
and neural networks, allowing the learning of embedded closures and neural
constitutive models. We validate JAX-MPM on several 2D and 3D benchmarks,
including dam-breaks and granular collapses, demonstrating its accuracy and
performance. A high-resolution 3D granular cylinder collapse with 2.7 million
particles completes 1000 steps in ~22 seconds (single precision) and ~98
seconds (double precision) on a single GPU. Beyond forward modeling, we
demonstrate inverse modeling capabilities such as velocity field reconstruction
and spatially varying friction estimation. These results establish JAX-MPM as a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing critical health threats from air pollution in cities, particularly Cork, where nitrogen dioxide levels exceed WHO standards by up to 278%.

Method: Analyzed 10 years of pollution data and 30 years of weather records, evaluating 17 machine learning algorithms to find Extra Trees as the optimal solution.

Result: Achieved 77% prediction accuracy, identified meteorological conditions as primary pollution drivers, and detected a 31% improvement in air quality from 2014 to 2022.

Conclusion: AI forecasting can empower city planners with tools for early warnings and informed decisions, transforming urban air quality management.

Abstract: Air pollution poses a critical health threat in cities worldwide, with
nitrogen dioxide levels in Cork, Ireland exceeding World Health Organization
safety standards by up to $278\%$. This study leverages artificial intelligence
to predict air pollution with unprecedented accuracy, analyzing nearly ten
years of data from five monitoring stations combined with 30 years of weather
records. We evaluated 17 machine learning algorithms, with Extra Trees emerging
as the optimal solution, achieving $77\%$ prediction accuracy and significantly
outperforming traditional forecasting methods. Our analysis reveals that
meteorological conditions particularly temperature, wind speed, and humidity
are the primary drivers of pollution levels, while traffic patterns and
seasonal changes create predictable pollution cycles. Pollution exhibits
dramatic seasonal variations, with winter levels nearly double those of summer,
and daily rush-hour peaks reaching $120\%$ above normal levels. While Cork's
air quality shows concerning violations of global health standards, our models
detected an encouraging $31\%$ improvement from 2014 to 2022. This research
demonstrates that intelligent forecasting systems can provide city planners and
environmental officials with powerful prediction tools, enabling life-saving
early warning systems and informed urban planning decisions. The technology
exists today to transform urban air quality management. All research materials

TL;DR: The paper derives an explicit formulation of the learned noise predictor in DDPMs, linking it to the forward-process noise, and provides a rigorous proof of a fundamental equality in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the relationship between the learned noise predictor and the forward-process noise in DDPMs, and to provide a deeper theoretical understanding of diffusion models.

Method: Derives an explicit formulation of the noise predictor in terms of the forward-process noise and presents a novel proof of a key equality.

Result: The paper shows how the forward-process noise contributes to the learned predictor and rigorously proves the fundamental equality.

Conclusion: The work enhances theoretical insight into diffusion models, clarifying the origin of a key equality and its implications for algorithmic design.

Abstract: In denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), the learned noise
predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ is trained to approximate the
forward-process noise $\epsilon_t$. The equality $\nabla_{{\bf x}_t} \log
q({\bf x}_t) = -\frac 1 {\sqrt {1- {\bar \alpha}_t} } \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$ plays a fundamental role in both theoretical analyses and
algorithmic design, and thus is frequently employed across diffusion-based
generative models. In this paper, an explicit formulation of $
\epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ in terms of the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ is derived. This result show how the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ contributes to the learned predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$. Furthermore, based on this formulation, we present a novel and
mathematically rigorous proof of the fundamental equality above, clarifying its
origin and providing new theoretical insight into the structure of diffusion
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Partial Model Collapse (PMC), a novel unlearning method for LLMs that avoids reinforcing sensitive data by not including unlearning targets in the objective, leveraging distribution collapse instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods risk reinforcing sensitive data by optimizing on it, contradicting privacy principles.

Method: PMC triggers partial collapse on sensitive data, inspired by generative models' tendency to collapse when trained on their own outputs.

Result: Theoretically converges to unlearning targets and empirically removes private information more effectively than existing methods.

Conclusion: PMC advances unlearning by aligning with privacy constraints and avoiding exposure risks.

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they
seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue
this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also
fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we
propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does
not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is
inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own
generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information
from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by
triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze
that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the
information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes
two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize
on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from
model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward
more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

TL;DR: CP-Composer is a generative framework for zero-shot cyclic peptide design using geometric constraints, achieving success rates of 38%-84%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyclic peptides have enhanced properties but lack target-specific design due to limited training data.

Method: Decomposes cyclization patterns into unit constraints, integrates them into a diffusion model, and trains on linear peptides with random constraint combinations.

Result: Generates diverse target-binding cyclic peptides with success rates of 38%-84% across cyclization strategies.

Conclusion: CP-Composer effectively bridges the gap in cyclic peptide design, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear
peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities
to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic
peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap,
we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot
cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach
decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are
incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and
edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random
combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint
combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show
that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating
diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84%
on different cyclization strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the success of iterative thresholding methods in compressive sensing to high-order tensor recovery, leveraging low-dimensional structures in multi-way data.

Method: Develops TNIHT, a tensor version of NIHT, for low-rank tensor recovery under CP and Tucker rank models, with theoretical analysis under TRIP.

Result: Theoretical convergence is proven, and numerical experiments show TNIHT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic, image, and video data.

Conclusion: TNIHT effectively recovers low-rank tensors from limited measurements, supported by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Low-rank recovery builds upon ideas from the theory of compressive sensing,
which predicts that sparse signals can be accurately reconstructed from
incomplete measurements. Iterative thresholding-type algorithms-particularly
the normalized iterative hard thresholding (NIHT) method-have been widely used
in compressed sensing (CS) and applied to matrix recovery tasks. In this paper,
we propose a tensor extension of NIHT, referred to as TNIHT, for the recovery
of low-rank tensors under two widely used tensor decomposition models. This
extension enables the effective reconstruction of high-order low-rank tensors
from a limited number of linear measurements by leveraging the inherent
low-dimensional structure of multi-way data. Specifically, we consider both the
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank and the Tucker rank to characterize tensor
low-rankness within the TNIHT framework. At the same time, we establish a
convergence theorem for the proposed TNIHT method under the tensor restricted
isometry property (TRIP), providing theoretical support for its recovery
guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the performance of TNIHT through numerical
experiments on synthetic, image, and video data, and compare it with several
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces power attention, a linear-cost sequence modeling layer, to address limitations of transformers and sub-quadratic architectures for long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are too expensive for long sequences, while sub-quadratic architectures are too cheap, impairing in-context learning.

Method: Proposes power attention, a linear-cost layer with adjustable state size, and develops efficient GPU kernels for it.

Result: Power attention outperforms exponential and linear attention in long-context training.

Conclusion: Power attention is a practical solution for efficient long-sequence modeling, combining cost-effectiveness with performance.

Abstract: We argue that neither transformers nor sub-quadratic architectures are well
suited to training at long sequence lengths: the cost of processing the context
is too expensive in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such
as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token of a transformer
impair in-context learning, and so are also unsuitable. To address these
limitations, we introduce power attention, an architectural layer for
linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of
parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains.
We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention,
identifying a novel pattern of operation fusion to avoid memory and bandwidth
bottlenecks. Our experiments on the in-context learning of power attention
shows that these models dominate both exponential attention and linear
attention at long-context training.

TL;DR: ACTOR is a training framework that reduces over-refusals in LLMs by adjusting internal activation patterns, maintaining safety while improving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety alignment in LLMs often leads to over-refusals, harming user experience and model utility.

Method: ACTOR uses activation-based training to identify and adjust refusal-triggering components, fine-tuning a single model layer.

Result: ACTOR reduces over-refusals across benchmarks without compromising safety or utility.

Conclusion: ACTOR provides a robust, efficient solution to minimize over-refusals while preserving model safety and performance.

Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to resist
malicious instructions but often results in over-refusals, where benign prompts
are unnecessarily rejected, impairing user experience and model utility. We
introduce ACTOR (Activation-Based Training for Over-Refusal Reduction), a
robust and compute- and data-efficient training framework that minimizes
over-refusals by leveraging internal activation patterns from diverse queries.
ACTOR precisely identifies and adjusts the activation components that trigger
refusals, providing stronger control over the refusal mechanism. By fine-tuning
only a single model layer, ACTOR effectively reduces over-refusals across
multiple benchmarks while maintaining the model's ability to handle harmful
queries and preserve overall utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Retformer, a transformer-based model, uses retinal imaging and explainable AI for early Alzheimer's disease detection, outperforming benchmarks by up to 11%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is critical due to lack of treatments, and retinal imaging offers a non-invasive approach.

Method: Retformer leverages transformer architecture and explainable AI (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to analyze retinal images from AD patients and healthy controls.

Result: The model outperforms benchmark algorithms by up to 11% in performance metrics and identifies key retinal biomarkers for AD.

Conclusion: Retformer provides an effective, explainable tool for early AD detection using retinal imaging, with potential clinical applications.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
millions worldwide. In the absence of effective treatment options, early
diagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease
onset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a
novel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging
modalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial
intelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different
modalities of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy
controls, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image
features and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making
process of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
algorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of
the retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification
outcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting
AD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important
features for AD detection in each imaging modality. The Retformer model
outperforms a variety of benchmark algorithms across different performance
metrics by margins of up to 11\.

### [222] [Domain Adaptation of Drag Reduction Policy to Partial Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04309)
*Anton Plaksin,Georgios Rigas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a method to adapt feedback control policies from full-state to partial measurements using a Domain Specific Feature Transfer (DSFT) map, demonstrated in aerodynamic drag reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional, nonlinear fluid dynamics require full-state measurements, but real-world setups often only allow partial measurements.

Method: Train a DSFT map to reconstruct full measurements from partial data history, enabling optimal control policies with limited sensors.

Result: Demonstrated in simulation, the method reduces drag and determines optimal history length and policy architecture.

Conclusion: Enables practical implementation of optimal control in real-world systems with limited sensor data.

Abstract: Feedback control of fluid-based systems poses significant challenges due to
their high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale dynamics, which demand
real-time, three-dimensional, multi-component measurements for sensing. While
such measurements are feasible in digital simulations, they are often only
partially accessible in the real world. In this paper, we propose a method to
adapt feedback control policies obtained from full-state measurements to setups
with only partial measurements. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated
environment by minimising the aerodynamic drag of a simplified road vehicle.
Reinforcement learning algorithms can optimally solve this control task when
trained on full-state measurements by placing sensors in the wake. However, in
real-world applications, sensors are limited and typically only on the vehicle,
providing only partial measurements. To address this, we propose to train a
Domain Specific Feature Transfer (DSFT) map reconstructing the full
measurements from the history of the partial measurements. By applying this
map, we derive optimal policies based solely on partial data. Additionally, our
method enables determination of the optimal history length and offers insights
into the architecture of optimal control policies, facilitating their
implementation in real-world environments with limited sensor information.

### [223] [Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Prototype Alignment and Upscaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04310)
*Gyuejeong Lee,Jihwan Shin,Daeyoung Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoNorm improves prototype-based federated learning by enhancing prototype separation using Prototype Alignment and Prototype Upscaling, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing suboptimal prototype separation in prototype-based federated learning (PBFL) to enhance discriminative power.

Method: Introduces Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm) with Prototype Alignment (PA) for angular separation and Prototype Upscaling (PU) for Euclidean separation.

Result: ProtoNorm consistently outperforms existing heterogeneous FL approaches, improving prototype separation.

Conclusion: ProtoNorm is communication-efficient and suitable for resource-constrained environments, making it a practical solution for federated learning.

Abstract: Heterogeneity in data distributions and model architectures remains a
significant challenge in federated learning (FL). Various heterogeneous FL
(HtFL) approaches have recently been proposed to address this challenge. Among
them, prototype-based FL (PBFL) has emerged as a practical framework that only
shares per-class mean activations from the penultimate layer. However, PBFL
approaches often suffer from suboptimal prototype separation, limiting their
discriminative power. We propose Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm), a novel
PBFL framework that addresses this limitation through two key components:
Prototype Alignment (PA) and Prototype Upscaling (PU). The PA method draws
inspiration from the Thomson problem in classical physics, optimizing global
prototype configurations on a unit sphere to maximize angular separation;
subsequently, the PU method increases prototype magnitudes to enhance
separation in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show
that our approach better separates prototypes and thus consistently outperforms
existing HtFL approaches. Notably, since ProtoNorm inherits the communication
efficiency of PBFL and the PA is performed server-side, it is particularly
suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TinyProto improves federated learning communication efficiency by sparsifying and adaptively scaling class prototypes, reducing costs by 4x without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication efficiency in federated learning is hindered by large feature dimensions and class counts, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Method: TinyProto uses Class-wise Prototype Sparsification (CPS) for structured sparsity and adaptive prototype scaling to adjust prototypes based on class distributions.

Result: TinyProto reduces communication costs by up to 4x while maintaining performance, with no client-side computational overhead.

Conclusion: TinyProto is an efficient solution for resource-constrained, heterogeneous federated learning, offering significant communication savings.

Abstract: Communication efficiency in federated learning (FL) remains a critical
challenge for resource-constrained environments. While prototype-based FL
reduces communication overhead by sharing class prototypes-mean activations in
the penultimate layer-instead of model parameters, its efficiency decreases
with larger feature dimensions and class counts. We propose TinyProto, which
addresses these limitations through Class-wise Prototype Sparsification (CPS)
and adaptive prototype scaling. CPS enables structured sparsity by allocating
specific dimensions to class prototypes and transmitting only non-zero
elements, while adaptive scaling adjusts prototypes based on class
distributions. Our experiments show TinyProto reduces communication costs by up
to 4x compared to existing methods while maintaining performance. Beyond its
communication efficiency, TinyProto offers crucial advantages: achieving
compression without client-side computational overhead and supporting
heterogeneous architectures, making it ideal for resource-constrained
heterogeneous FL.

TL;DR: APCs introduce a novel framework for representation learning using probabilistic circuits, outperforming existing methods in reconstruction, embedding quality, and robustness to missing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the underexplored area of representation learning in probabilistic circuits by leveraging their tractability for explicit probabilistic embeddings.

Method: Extend PCs to jointly model data and embeddings, using a PC encoder for handling missing data and integrating a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable architecture.

Result: APCs outperform PC-based autoencoding methods in reconstruction, generate competitive embeddings, and show superior robustness to missing data compared to neural autoencoders.

Conclusion: APCs are a powerful, flexible representation learning method, promising for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable
exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic
reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks,
representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches
relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address
this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel
framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings
explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining
embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC
encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is
seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable
architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation
demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in
reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit
superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders.
These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning
method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing
promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and
knowledge distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many CATE estimation algorithms show inconsistent learning behavior across group assignments, which affects reliability.

Method: Introduces a metric for inconsistency and proposes CLAGA, a method to ensure consistent labeling across group assignments.

Result: CLAGA eliminates inconsistency and improves performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CLAGA effectively resolves inconsistency in CATE estimation, enhancing algorithm reliability and performance.

Abstract: Numerous algorithms have been developed for Conditional Average Treatment
Effect (CATE) estimation. In this paper, we first highlight a common issue
where many algorithms exhibit inconsistent learning behavior for the same
instance across different group assignments. We introduce a metric to quantify
and visualize this inconsistency. Next, we present a theoretical analysis
showing that this inconsistency indeed contributes to higher test errors and
cannot be resolved through conventional machine learning techniques. To address
this problem, we propose a general method called \textbf{Consistent Labeling
Across Group Assignments} (CLAGA), which eliminates the inconsistency and is
applicable to any existing CATE estimation algorithm. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance
improvements with CLAGA.

This paper investigates model inversion attacks on the Llama 3.2 model, a
multilingual LLM developed by Meta. By querying the model with carefully
crafted prompts, we demonstrate the extraction of personally identifiable

findings highlight the vulnerability of even smaller LLMs to privacy attacks
and underscore the need for robust defenses. We discuss potential mitigation
strategies, including differential privacy and data sanitization, and call for
further research into privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.

TL;DR: Interactive visualization improves RLHF by enabling group comparisons and exploration, boosting policy returns by 69.34%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance RLHF data collection by leveraging human visual ability to compare groups of samples, improving alignment with human preferences.

Method: Developed a two-view interface (exploration and comparison) with hierarchical clustering and active learning for group suggestions.

Result: Increased final policy returns by 69.34%, reduced error rates, and produced better policies in simulated robotics tasks.

Conclusion: The interactive visualization tool effectively improves RLHF efficiency and outcomes, with open-source code for broader adoption.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
enabling technology for aligning AI behavior with human preferences. The
traditional way to collect data in RLHF is via pairwise comparisons: human
raters are asked to indicate which one of two samples they prefer. We present
an interactive visualization that better exploits the human visual ability to
compare and explore whole groups of samples. The interface is comprised of two
linked views: 1) an exploration view showing a contextual overview of all
sampled behaviors organized in a hierarchical clustering structure; and 2) a
comparison view displaying two selected groups of behaviors for user queries.
Users can efficiently explore large sets of behaviors by iterating between
these two views. Additionally, we devised an active learning approach
suggesting groups for comparison. As shown by our evaluation in six simulated
robotics tasks, our approach increases the final policy returns by 69.34%. It
leads to lower error rates and better policies. We open-source the code that
can be easily integrated into the RLHF training loop, supporting research on
human-AI alignment.

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential documents in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, addressing computational challenges and evaluating practical explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to explain feature importance in LLMs, especially in RAG systems, is hindered by high computational costs. This study aims to make attribution feasible and effective.

Method: Compares Shapley values with approximations and existing methods, focusing on minimizing LLM interactions and evaluating explainability under complex document relationships.

Result: Provides insights into the feasibility of Shapley-based attribution in RAG, balancing accuracy and computational cost.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between powerful attribution techniques and practical constraints, offering reliable and affordable RAG explainability.

Abstract: While attribution methods, such as Shapley values, are widely used to explain
the importance of features or training data in traditional machine learning,
their application to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly within
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, is nascent and challenging. The
primary obstacle is the substantial computational cost, where each utility
function evaluation involves an expensive LLM call, resulting in direct
monetary and time expenses. This paper investigates the feasibility and
effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential
retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally
tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our
work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to
the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can
mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3)
evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents,
especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy,
complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between
powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG
systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG
explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature importance methods often fail to capture high-order interactions and overlapping contributions, limiting interpretability.

Method: The proposed method leverages CMI estimated via kNN on mixed discrete/continuous variables, decomposing feature contributions into unique, synergistic, and redundant components.

Result: Validated on synthetic and real-world data (TCGA-BRCA), the method accurately recovers theoretical interaction patterns.

Conclusion: The framework offers a richer, model-independent understanding of feature roles, useful for feature selection and model development.

Abstract: Understanding the contribution of individual features in predictive models
remains a central goal in interpretable machine learning, and while many
model-agnostic methods exist to estimate feature importance, they often fall
short in capturing high-order interactions and disentangling overlapping
contributions. In this work, we present an information-theoretic extension of
the High-order interactions for Feature importance (Hi-Fi) method, leveraging
Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) estimated via a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
approach working on mixed discrete and continuous random variables. Our
framework decomposes feature contributions into unique, synergistic, and
redundant components, offering a richer, model-independent understanding of
their predictive roles. We validate the method using synthetic datasets with
known Gaussian structures, where ground truth interaction patterns are
analytically derived, and further test it on non-Gaussian and real-world gene
expression data from TCGA-BRCA. Results indicate that the proposed estimator
accurately recovers theoretical and expected findings, providing a potential
use case for developing feature selection algorithms or model development based
on interaction analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoSiA is a PEFT method that dynamically optimizes critical sub-networks, reducing computational inefficiency and improving fine-tuning performance compared to LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods like LoRA are computationally inefficient due to extensive matrix multiplications, leading to sub-optimal performance in domain specialization tasks.

Method: LoSiA identifies and optimizes a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis, reducing additional matrix multiplications. LoSiA-Pro further speeds up training.

Result: LoSiA achieves minimal performance drop compared to full fine-tuning, reduces training time by 27% vs. LoRA, and mitigates forgetting in continued training.

Conclusion: LoSiA offers an efficient and effective alternative to existing PEFT methods, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly
reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition
matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in
domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and
sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources
Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes
and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it
identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as
the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by
updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix
multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA,
which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive
evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to
full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain
specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that
LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL pretext tasks in remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) often ignore the temporal dynamics of agriculture, such as nature's cycle. This gap motivates the proposal of agriculture-specific tasks.

Method: Three new pretext tasks are introduced: Time-Difference Prediction (TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction (FP), and Future-Frame Prediction (FF). These are evaluated on the SICKLE and FTW India datasets.

Result: FF achieves 69.6% IoU on crop mapping, FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE, and TD remains competitive. FF also scales well to national-scale field boundary delineation in India (54.2% IoU).

Conclusion: The proposed agriculture-specific pretext tasks significantly outperform existing baselines, demonstrating their effectiveness in leveraging temporal characteristics for SSL in remote sensing.

Abstract: Self Supervised Learning(SSL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
label-efficient learning, and has been widely utilized by remote sensing
foundation models(RSFMs). Recent RSFMs including SatMAE, DoFA, primarily rely
on masked autoencoding(MAE), contrastive learning or some combination of them.
However, these pretext tasks often overlook the unique temporal characteristics
of agricultural landscape, namely nature's cycle. Motivated by this gap, we
propose three novel agriculture-specific pretext tasks, namely Time-Difference
Prediction(TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction(FP), and Future-Frame
Prediction(FF). Comprehensive evaluation on SICKLE dataset shows FF achieves
69.6% IoU on crop mapping and FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE,
outperforming all baselines, and TD remains competitive on most tasks. Further,
we also scale FF to the national scale of India, achieving 54.2% IoU
outperforming all baselines on field boundary delineation on FTW India dataset.

TL;DR: A novel framework for contextual anomaly detection (CAD) using normalcy score (NS) models uncertainties and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for detecting anomalies in target variables influenced by contextual variables, focusing on uncertainty modeling.

Method: Proposes NS, built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, treating Z-score as a random variable for confidence intervals.

Result: Outperforms existing CAD methods in accuracy and interpretability, validated on benchmarks and a cardiology application.

Conclusion: NS provides reliable, interpretable anomaly detection with adaptive decision-making, valuable for domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target
(behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that
influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators
of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables
that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves
indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD,
normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method
regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that
reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on
benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate
that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and
interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive,
uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in
domains such as healthcare.

Result: Achieves 99.22% and 98.83% accuracy with 96.6% and 97.6% dimensionality reduction, improving computational efficiency by 30.1x and 42.5x.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning-based sequential feature selection is validated for malware classification, offering superior accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Traditional malware detection methods exhibit computational inefficiency due
to exhaustive feature extraction requirements, creating accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs that limit real-time deployment. We formulate malware classification
as a Markov Decision Process with episodic feature acquisition and propose a
Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) framework for adaptive sequential feature
selection. The agent learns to dynamically select informative features per
sample before terminating with classification decisions, optimizing both
detection accuracy and computational cost through reinforcement learning.
  We evaluate our approach on Microsoft Big2015 (9-class, 1,795 features) and
BODMAS (binary, 2,381 features) datasets. D3QN achieves 99.22% and 98.83%
accuracy while utilizing only 61 and 56 features on average, representing 96.6%
and 97.6% dimensionality reduction. This yields computational efficiency
improvements of 30.1x and 42.5x over traditional ensemble methods.
Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent superiority over Random
Forest, XGBoost, and static feature selection approaches.
  Quantitative analysis demonstrates that D3QN learns non-random feature
selection policies with 62.5% deviation from uniform baseline distributions.
The learned policies exhibit structured hierarchical preferences, utilizing
high-level metadata features for initial assessment while selectively
incorporating detailed behavioral features based on classification uncertainty.
Feature specialization analysis reveals 57.7% of examined features demonstrate
significant class-specific discrimination patterns. Our results validate
reinforcement learning-based sequential feature selection for malware
classification, achieving superior accuracy with substantial computational
reduction through learned adaptive policies.

Conclusion: The causal modeling and targeted intervention strategy enhance HRL efficiency, supported by theoretical and experimental validation.

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) improves the efficiency of
long-horizon reinforcement-learning tasks with sparse rewards by decomposing
the task into a hierarchy of subgoals. The main challenge of HRL is efficient
discovery of the hierarchical structure among subgoals and utilizing this
structure to achieve the final goal. We address this challenge by modeling the
subgoal structure as a causal graph and propose a causal discovery algorithm to
learn it. Additionally, rather than intervening on the subgoals at random
during exploration, we harness the discovered causal model to prioritize
subgoal interventions based on their importance in attaining the final goal.
These targeted interventions result in a significantly more efficient policy in
terms of the training cost. Unlike previous work on causal HRL, which lacked
theoretical analysis, we provide a formal analysis of the problem.
Specifically, for tree structures and, for a variant of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, our approach results in remarkable improvements. Our
experimental results on HRL tasks also illustrate that our proposed framework
outperforms existing work in terms of training cost.

*Aman Mehra,Alexandre Capone,Jeff Schneider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how expert demonstrations and simulators with arbitrary resets can improve sample efficiency in online RL by using an auxiliary start state distribution informed by safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of exploration in online RL by leveraging expert demonstrations and simulators, which are often underutilized.

Method: Use an auxiliary start state distribution, informed by safety (measured via episode length), to guide exploration and accelerate learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art sample efficiency in a sparse-reward hard-exploration environment.

Conclusion: Leveraging expert demonstrations and simulators with safety-informed auxiliary distributions significantly improves RL sample efficiency.

Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring
sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments
efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a
setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available
to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert
demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These
affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide
exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number
of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can
accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable
choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true
start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can
significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety
to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates
learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this
notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward
hard-exploration environment.

*Mostafa Elhoushi,Jeff Johnson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: any4 is a 4-bit weight quantization method for LLMs, outperforming other 4-bit types (int4, fp4, nf4) and competing with preprocessing-heavy techniques like AWQ and GPTQ. It also works well at 3 and 2 bits and simplifies calibration with a single sample. The paper includes tinygemm, an optimized GPU library for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve quantization accuracy for LLMs without preprocessing weights or activations, while maintaining competitiveness with existing methods.

Method: any4 uses learned 4-bit quantization with arbitrary numeric representations, avoiding preprocessing. It also introduces tinygemm, a GPU-efficient matrix multiplication library.

Result: any4 achieves higher accuracy than other 4-bit methods (int4, fp4, nf4) and competes with preprocessing techniques. It also performs well at 3 and 2 bits.

Conclusion: any4 is an effective, preprocessing-free quantization solution for LLMs, with competitive accuracy and efficiency, supported by the open-source tinygemm library.

Abstract: We present any4, a learned 4-bit weight quantization solution for large
language models (LLMs) providing arbitrary numeric representations without
requiring pre-processing of weights or activations. any4 yields higher accuracy
compared to other related 4-bit numeric representation types: int4, fp4 and
nf4, as evaluated on a range of model sizes, generations and families (Llama 2,
Llama 3, Mistral and Mixtral). While any4 does not require preprocessing of
weights or activations, it is also competitive with orthogonal techniques that
require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3
and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we
can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of
samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open
source tinygemm, a latency optimized GPU matrix multiplication library for
LLMs, that implements any4 using a GPU-efficient lookup table strategy along
with other common quantization methods. We open source our code at

### [239] [Inverse Reinforcement Learning using Revealed Preferences and Passive Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04396)
*Vikram Krishnamurthy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The monograph explores Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) through revealed preferences and adaptive Langevin dynamics, covering utility reconstruction, Bayesian IRL, and real-time utility tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and reconstruct agent behavior and utility functions using IRL, addressing noisy actions and adaptive scenarios.

Method: Uses revealed preference theory, Bayesian IRL, and Langevin dynamics for adaptive IRL.

Result: Set-valued utility estimates, detection of cognitive radar and Bayesian agents, and real-time utility tracking.

Conclusion: IRL methods effectively reconstruct and track agent utilities, with applications in cognitive radar and sequential detection.

Abstract: This monograph, spanning three chapters, explores Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL). The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the
third chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient
algorithms.
  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and
extensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent
actions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an
agent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a
cognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also
addresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization
behavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.
  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine
if an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer
(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The
chapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing
the continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random
horizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a
Bayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise
overview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse
stochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.
  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive
Langevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions
given noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms
presented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient
algorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic
gradient algorithm is in operation.

*Linfeng Ye,Shayan Mohajer Hamidi,Guang Li,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes IGDS, an information-guided diffusion sampling method, to improve dataset distillation by preserving prototype and contextual information, especially in low-IPC settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with diversity in low-IPC settings, limiting their effectiveness for dataset distillation.

Method: IGDS maximizes prototype information (I(X;Y)) and contextual information (H(X|Y)) using variational estimations, adapting to IPC with a parameter β.

Result: IGDS outperforms existing methods on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet subsets, particularly in low-IPC regimes.

Conclusion: IGDS effectively enhances dataset distillation by balancing information preservation, offering significant improvements in diverse settings.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential
information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have
shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)
settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address
this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key
types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype
information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and
($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class
variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables
corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.
Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose
maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling
process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing
$\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop
variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a
data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling
(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset
distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet
subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly
in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

### [241] [Convergence and Sample Complexity of First-Order Methods for Agnostic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04406)
*Uri Sherman,Tomer Koren,Yishay Mansour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for agnostic policy learning, focusing on competitive performance without assuming optimality in the policy class. It introduces and analyzes three algorithms under a weaker assumption (VGD), providing theoretical and empirical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of learning competitive policies in RL without assuming the optimal policy is within a given class, which is more realistic but less studied.

Method: The method involves reducing the problem to non-Euclidean first-order optimization, analyzing three algorithms: Steepest Descent Policy Optimization, Conservative Policy Iteration (reinterpreted via Frank-Wolfe), and Policy Mirror Descent.

Result: Theoretical sample complexity bounds are derived for the algorithms under the VGD condition, and empirical evaluation confirms the practical relevance of this assumption.

Conclusion: The framework and analysis provide new insights into policy learning algorithms, demonstrating their effectiveness under weaker assumptions and practical conditions.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) in the agnostic policy learning setting,
where the goal is to find a policy whose performance is competitive with the
best policy in a given class of interest $\Pi$ -- crucially, without assuming
that $\Pi$ contains the optimal policy. We propose a general policy learning
framework that reduces this problem to first-order optimization in a
non-Euclidean space, leading to new algorithms as well as shedding light on the
convergence properties of existing ones. Specifically, under the assumption
that $\Pi$ is convex and satisfies a variational gradient dominance (VGD)
condition -- an assumption known to be strictly weaker than more standard
completeness and coverability conditions -- we obtain sample complexity upper
bounds for three policy learning algorithms: \emph{(i)} Steepest Descent Policy
Optimization, derived from a constrained steepest descent method for non-convex
optimization; \emph{(ii)} the classical Conservative Policy Iteration algorithm
\citep{kakade2002approximately} reinterpreted through the lens of the
Frank-Wolfe method, which leads to improved convergence results; and
\emph{(iii)} an on-policy instantiation of the well-studied Policy Mirror
Descent algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate the VGD condition across
several standard environments, demonstrating the practical relevance of our key
assumption.

*Yusong Zhang,Yuxuan Sun,Lei Guo,Wei Chen,Bo Ai,Deniz Gunduz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel MLLM-SC framework integrates multimodal large language models for context-aware, task-oriented 6G wireless communication, optimizing bandwidth and content quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G networks require high-dimensional, real-time data processing for immersive applications like AR/VR, demanding intelligent, context-aware solutions.

Method: Device-edge collaborative architecture with MLLM-driven semantic guidance, importance-aware encoding/decoding, and adaptive bandwidth allocation.

Result: Validated through AR/VR visual question answering and diffusion-driven image generation, showing effective semantic communication.

Conclusion: MLLM-SC enhances 6G communication by leveraging foundation models for context-aware, efficient, and high-quality data transmission.

Abstract: 6G networks promise revolutionary immersive communication experiences
including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holographic
communications. These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data
transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely
challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a
joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential
to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel
multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications
framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative
capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and
task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a
device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic
guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel
conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing
semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a
resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which
can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and
high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on
visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image
generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.

*Jiawei Guo,Yang Xiao,Weipeng Huang,Guangyuan Piao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HMCN and HMCL for hierarchical multilabel classification of mobile apps using textual data, improving downstream tasks like credit risk management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance user modeling by providing granular app labels beyond traditional broad categories, benefiting businesses integrating these labels with user data.

Method: Proposes HMCN for hierarchical multilabel classification (with and without constraints) and HMCL for learning distinguishable app representations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Tencent App Store and public datasets, improving credit risk management performance by 10.70%.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and has been successfully deployed, demonstrating practical utility in real-world applications.

Abstract: A hierarchical labeling system for mobile applications (apps) benefits a wide
range of downstream businesses that integrate the labeling with their
proprietary user data, to improve user modeling. Such a label hierarchy can
define more granular labels that capture detailed app features beyond the
limitations of traditional broad app categories. In this paper, we address the
problem of hierarchical multilabel classification for apps by using their
textual information such as names and descriptions. We present: 1) HMCN
(Hierarchical Multilabel Classification Network) for handling the
classification from two perspectives: the first focuses on a multilabel
classification without hierarchical constraints, while the second predicts
labels sequentially at each hierarchical level considering such constraints; 2)
HMCL (Hierarchical Multilabel Contrastive Learning), a scheme that is capable
of learning more distinguishable app representations to enhance the performance
of HMCN. Empirical results on our Tencent App Store dataset and two public
datasets demonstrate that our approach performs well compared with
state-of-the-art methods. The approach has been deployed at Tencent and the
multilabel classification outputs for apps have helped a downstream
task--credit risk management of user--improve its performance by 10.70% with
regard to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric, for over one year.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEED (Self-Evolving Distillation) mitigates hallucinations in LVLMs by purging inner knowledge issues and distilling purified knowledge, improving model performance without external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination issues in LVLMs limit their credibility and application potential, and existing mitigation methods increase inference time.

Method: Proposes SEED to identify and purge hallucinations, uses Mode-Seeking Evolving to avoid void spaces, and introduces a Hallucination Elimination Adapter for correction.

Result: SEED significantly improves hallucination mitigation, e.g., LLaVA-1.5's F1 score on POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

Conclusion: SEED offers an effective, self-evolving solution to reduce hallucinations in LVLMs, enhancing their reliability and performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination
issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential.
Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison
of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation
(\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of
LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back
into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that
traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the
output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking
Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of
the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that
could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination
Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by
learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in
mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and
InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination
evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

*Tim Beyer,Yan Scholten,Stephan Günnemann,Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework for evaluating adversarial robustness in LLMs by modeling the entire output distribution, including tail-risks, improving robustness estimates and attack efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks on LLMs ignore their stochastic nature, focusing only on single-point, greedy generations, which limits accurate robustness assessment.

Method: Proposes a framework that treats attacks as a resource allocation problem, integrating sampling into attacks to optimize compute tradeoffs and analyze output harm distributions.

Result: Integrating sampling boosts attack success rates by up to 48% and efficiency by 100x. Most optimization strategies minimally affect output harmfulness.

Conclusion: Tail-aware attacks and evaluation are crucial for accurately assessing and enhancing LLM safety, with potential for new optimization targets like entropy-maximization.

Abstract: To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at
scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness.
Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in
single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature
of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness
evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including
tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By
casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between
optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that
integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves
efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to
analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions.
Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on
output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept
objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware
perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight
the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately
assess and strengthen LLM safety.

*Hanseon Joo,Hayoung Choi,Ook Lee,Minjong Cheon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MJKAN combines KANs' non-linear power with MLPs' efficiency using a FiLM-like mechanism and RBF activations, showing superior regression but competitive classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of KANs (high computational costs, performance deficits) by integrating FiLM and RBF activations for better efficiency and expressiveness.

Method: Proposes MJKAN, a hybrid layer combining FiLM-like modulation with RBF activations, validated on regression, image, and text tasks.

Result: MJKAN excels in function regression, outperforming MLPs, but matches MLPs in classification, with performance tied to basis function count.

Conclusion: MJKAN balances KANs' theoretical strengths with practical efficiency, requiring careful tuning of basis functions for optimal performance.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed
activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit
practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance
deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the
Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome
these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like
mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid
architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the
efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's
performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG
News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior
approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly
outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions
increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was
competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis
functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better
generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned
to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN
offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs
while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transfer learning operates in a feature learning regime for both pretraining and downstream tasks.

Method: Analyzes Bayesian frameworks and gradient flow training with weight decay, tracking feature evolution and using adapted feature kernels.

Result: Identifies elastic weight coupling as a key factor in feature reuse and explores its interplay with dataset size and task alignment.

Conclusion: The theory and experiments highlight the importance of feature learning strength and task alignment in transfer learning effectiveness.

Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks
where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in
a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where
learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and
gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight
decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target
tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels
which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and
target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an
elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features
learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and
polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and
experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling,
feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment
on the utility of transfer learning.

Motivation: To enable AI systems to autonomously perceive, reason, and act in complex urban settings, addressing the need for long-term adaptability and domain-specific knowledge.

Method: Introduces C-RAG-LLM, a Continual Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM, with a multilevel optimization framework for flexible training and incremental corpus updates to handle data drift.

Result: Effective performance on real-world urban tasks of varying complexity, demonstrating adaptability and scalability.

Conclusion: UrbanMind advances the development of general-purpose LLM agents for future urban environments.

Abstract: Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to
autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban
environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI.
Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual
Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates
domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term
adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel
optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent
sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either
independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework
is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise
optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive
under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating
mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity
verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a
promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future
urban environments.

TL;DR: ESSA introduces Evolutionary Strategies (ES) for scalable alignment of LLMs, offering efficiency, parallelizability, and stability compared to gradient-based methods like RLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF's high computational costs, memory demands, and instability in scaling LLMs necessitate a more efficient alignment method.

Method: ESSA uses ES for alignment, leveraging its parallelizability and memory efficiency, and introduces low-rank adaptation to handle high-dimensional LLMs.

Result: ESSA converges faster and is more data-efficient than gradient-based methods like GRPO, as shown in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: ES is a scalable and promising alternative to gradient-based alignment for efficient post-training of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on alignment techniques
to ensure that their outputs match human preferences. Although reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) is the dominant approach, it has high
computational costs, memory requirements, and training instability,
particularly when scaling to larger models. This paper introduces ESSA
(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses
Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for
gradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable
properties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to
sparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially
when starting from a strong pre-trained policy. Moreover, ES eliminates the
need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, making the alignment process simpler
and more stable. Although ES excels in low-dimensional optimization, it poses a
challenge when applied to high-dimensional LLMs. To address this challenge, we
propose a parameter-efficient architectural modification that reduces the
dimensionality of optimization through low-rank adaptation. We evaluated our
approach on mathematical reasoning tasks with verifiable accuracy-based
metrics, demonstrating that ESSA converges faster and is more data efficient
than gradient-based methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our
findings establish ES as a promising and scalable alternative to gradient-based
alignment, paving the way for efficient post-training of large language models.

*Sanyam Vyas,Alberto Caron,Chris Hicks,Pete Burnap,Vasilios Mavroudis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores backdoor attacks in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems, introducing two novel attacks (TrojanentRL and InfrectroRL) that operate under stricter adversarial constraints than existing methods, challenging current research focus and defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL systems are widely used in safety-critical applications, but their security is underexplored, especially concerning backdoor attacks. Existing research focuses on unrealistic training-time attacks, leaving vulnerabilities in the DRL supply chain unaddressed.

Method: The authors propose two attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, exploiting component-level flaws for persistent backdoors, and (2) InfrectroRL, a post-training attack requiring no access to training or test data. Both are evaluated empirically and analytically across six Atari environments.

Result: The attacks rival state-of-the-art training-time backdoor attacks despite stricter constraints. InfrectroRL also evades two leading DRL backdoor defenses.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in DRL systems and the urgent need for robust defenses beyond current research focus.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in
safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely
underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden
triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the
observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on
training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In
contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supply chain where
backdoors can be embedded with significantly reduced adversarial privileges. We
introduce two novel attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, which exploits component-level
flaws to implant a persistent backdoor that survives full model retraining; and
(2) InfrectroRL, a post-training backdoor attack which requires no access to
training, validation, nor test data. Empirical and analytical evaluations
across six Atari environments show our attacks rival state-of-the-art
training-time backdoor attacks while operating under much stricter adversarial
constraints. We also demonstrate that InfrectroRL further evades two leading
DRL backdoor defenses. These findings challenge the current research focus and
highlight the urgent need for robust defenses.

TL;DR: Proposes an object-centric denoising diffusion model for physical reasoning, capable of conditioning on arbitrary time steps and objects, with equivariance properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive models for physical reasoning are limited to initial state conditioning, while diffusion models in other fields show promise for more flexible conditioning.

Method: Develops a translation and permutation equivariant denoising diffusion model architecture for object-centric physical reasoning.

Result: Demonstrates the model's ability to handle multiple conditions and adapt to varying object numbers and trajectory lengths.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a flexible and effective approach for physical reasoning tasks with complex conditioning requirements.

Abstract: Reasoning about the trajectories of multiple, interacting objects is integral
to physical reasoning tasks in machine learning. This involves conditions
imposed on the objects at different time steps, for instance initial states or
desired goal states. Existing approaches in physical reasoning generally rely
on autoregressive modeling, which can only be conditioned on initial states,
but not on later states. In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning,
similar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this
work, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for
physical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation
equivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for
arbitrary objects. We demonstrate how this model can solve tasks with multiple
conditions and examine its performance when changing object numbers and
trajectory lengths during inference.

*Ruihao Zhang,Fei Ye,Dandan Meng,Yixuan Huang,Maochen,Xiao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAMil, a deep learning framework, uses TCR sequencing to diagnose SLE and RA with high accuracy, identifying disease-associated genes and stratifying patients by severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited clinical application of TCR repertoires due to sequence sparsity and low witness rates motivates the development of EAMil for autoimmune disease diagnosis.

Method: EAMil integrates PrimeSeq feature extraction, ESMonehot encoding, and gate attention mechanisms to analyze TCR sequencing data.

Result: Achieved AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA, identified disease-associated genes, and stratified SLE patients by severity using SLEDAI scores.

Conclusion: EAMil offers an interpretable, robust framework for autoimmune disease detection with broad clinical potential.

Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures
for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by
sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance
deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional
accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding
and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art
performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully
identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established
differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes.
The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories,
utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well
as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling
for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework
for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease
detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across
immune-mediated conditions.

performance with an R^2 value of 0.891 and RMSE of 0.152, significantly
outperforming other models. LightGBM showed remarkable computational
efficiency, completing training in 25.7 seconds while maintaining high

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using small-scale, domain-specific datasets for training in-context learners, showing improved generalization and comparable performance to large datasets, while addressing privacy and ethical concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training paradigms rely on large, unstructured datasets, which are costly, hard to evaluate, and pose privacy risks. The paper aims to address these issues.

Method: Leveraging meta-learning, the authors train in-context learners on the Meta-Album collection, testing performance in controlled, continual, and unsupervised scenarios.

Result: Transformers generalize well for in-context prediction when trained on curated datasets, offering modularity and replaceability advantages.

Conclusion: Small-scale, domain-specific datasets can effectively train in-context learners, improving generalization and addressing ethical and practical concerns.

Abstract: In-context learning enables transformer models to generalize to new tasks
based solely on input prompts, without any need for weight updates. However,
existing training paradigms typically rely on large, unstructured datasets that
are costly to store, difficult to evaluate for quality and balance, and pose
privacy and ethical concerns due to the inclusion of sensitive information.
Motivated by these limitations and risks, we propose an alternative training
strategy where we leverage a collection of multiple, small-scale, and
domain-specific datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the increased quality
and diversity of such data improve the generalization abilities of in-context
learners beyond their training domain, while achieving comparable performance
with models trained on a single large-scale dataset. We investigate this
paradigm by leveraging meta-learning to train an in-context learner on the
Meta-Album collection under several settings. Firstly, we show the performance
in a controlled environment, where the test domain is completely excluded from
the training knowledge. Secondly, we explore the robustness of these models to
forgetting in a continual scenario where the information is accessible for a
limited time. Finally, we explore the more challenging unsupervised scenario.
Our findings demonstrate that transformers still generalize for in-context
prediction when trained on a curated dataset collection while offering
advantages in modularity and replaceability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression method, reduces neuron-level redundancy in large models by combining similar neurons using optimal transport theory, outperforming pruning-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Transformer models contain computational redundancy, which can be exploited for compression without significant performance loss.

Method: DOTResize frames width reduction as a Discrete Optimal Transport problem, incorporating entropic regularization and matrix factorization to compress model weights.

Result: DOTResize outperforms pruning-based methods across various LLM families and sizes, reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: DOTResize effectively compresses large models by redistributing useful signal, offering a practical alternative to pruning.

Abstract: Model compression offers a promising path to reducing the cost and
inaccessibility of large pre-trained models, without significantly compromising
their impressive performance. Large Transformer models, including large
language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve
as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically
target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar
neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal
Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression
method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model
weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we
motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into
the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches
which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the
entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal
across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or
state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform
these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving
measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve large language models by formatting inference-time compute as multi-turn interactions with a stateful tool, enhancing efficiency and learning in code repair tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the use of additional compute during inference by structuring it as interactive traces with tools, improving task performance and reward density.

Method: Uses multi-turn interactions with a stateful tool, appending tool states to the model's context and generating control tokens via a custom DSL, tested on Python code repair.

Result: Enables faster experience sampling and denser rewards, allowing even 3B-parameter models to effectively use extra compute for task proficiency.

Conclusion: The constrained multi-turn interaction setup improves model efficiency and learning in compute-intensive tasks like code repair.

Abstract: Recent advances have established a new machine learning paradigm based on
scaling up compute at inference time as well as at training time. In that line
of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic
demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is
used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during
inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this
paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction
trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended
to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to
control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of
repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup
allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing
even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend
additional compute on the task.

TL;DR: PRING introduces a graph-level benchmark for protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction, addressing limitations of pairwise evaluations. It includes a high-quality dataset and two evaluation paradigms to assess model performance in network reconstruction and functional tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PPI prediction benchmarks focus on pairwise evaluations, neglecting the ability to reconstruct biologically meaningful networks, which is critical for biology research.

Method: PRING curates a multi-species PPI dataset and establishes two evaluation paradigms: topology-oriented tasks (network construction) and function-oriented tasks (protein function annotation).

Result: Experiments reveal limitations in current PPI models for recovering structural and functional network properties, highlighting gaps for real-world applications.

Conclusion: PRING offers a reliable platform to advance PPI prediction models, supporting biological research with its dataset and evaluation framework.

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in
predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's
capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is
crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the
first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction
prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,
multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818
interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and
leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two
complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess
intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented
tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and
essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's
capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein
function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism
analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,
consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language
model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI
models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional
properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world
biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide
the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The
dataset and source code of PRING are available at

TL;DR: A lightweight deep learning model for Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is proposed, optimized for edge devices, achieving efficient spectrum utilization with low complexity and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient spectrum utilization and lightweight AMC models for resource-constrained edge devices drives this research.

Method: The paper introduces a dual-path deep residual shrinkage network (DP-DRSN) with Garrote thresholding and a compact hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture with 27,000 training parameters.

Result: The model achieves average accuracies of 61.20%, 63.78%, and 62.13% on RML2016.10a, RML2016.10b, and RML2018.01a datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed model balances efficiency and performance, making it suitable for accurate AMC on resource-limited edge devices.

Abstract: Efficient spectrum utilization is critical to meeting the growing data
demands of modern wireless communication networks. Automatic Modulation
Classification (AMC) plays a key role in enhancing spectrum efficiency by
accurately identifying modulation schemes in received signals-an essential
capability for dynamic spectrum allocation and interference mitigation,
particularly in cognitive radio (CR) systems. With the increasing deployment of
smart edge devices, such as IoT nodes with limited computational and memory
resources, there is a pressing need for lightweight AMC models that balance low
complexity with high classification accuracy. This paper proposes a
low-complexity, lightweight deep learning (DL) AMC model optimized for
resource-constrained edge devices. We introduce a dual-path deep residual
shrinkage network (DP-DRSN) with Garrote thresholding for effective signal
denoising and design a compact hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture comprising only
27,000 training parameters. The proposed model achieves average classification
accuracies of 61.20%, 63.78%, and 62.13% on the RML2016.10a, RML2016.10b, and
RML2018.01a datasets, respectively demonstrating a strong balance between model
efficiency and classification performance. These results underscore the model's
potential for enabling accurate and efficient AMC on-edge devices with limited
resources.

TL;DR: Photon Splatting is a neural surrogate model for real-time wireless channel prediction, using virtual photons to predict channel responses efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time wireless channel prediction in complex environments without retraining for new configurations.

Method: Uses surface-attached virtual photons with wave signatures, splatted onto receiver's angular domain via geodesic rasterizer. Trains a physically grounded representation.

Result: Achieves 30ms inference latency and accurate predictions in diverse scenarios, including complex indoor environments.

Conclusion: A promising solution for real-time wireless digital twins and 6G network planning due to its adaptability and interpretability.

Abstract: We present Photon Splatting, a physics-guided neural surrogate model for
real-time wireless channel prediction in complex environments. The proposed
framework introduces surface-attached virtual sources, referred to as photons,
which carry directional wave signatures informed by the scene geometry and
transmitter configuration. At runtime, channel impulse responses (CIRs) are
predicted by splatting these photons onto the angular domain of the receiver
using a geodesic rasterizer. The model is trained to learn a physically
grounded representation that maps transmitter-receiver configurations to full
channel responses. Once trained, it generalizes to new transmitter positions,
antenna beam patterns, and mobile receivers without requiring model retraining.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a series of
experiments, from canonical 3D scenes to a complex indoor cafe with 1,000
receivers. Results show 30 millisecond-level inference latency and accurate CIR
predictions across a wide range of configurations. The approach supports
real-time adaptability and interpretability, making it a promising candidate
for wireless digital twin platforms and future 6G network planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the debate on defining, building, using, and evaluating world models for artificial general intelligence.

Method: Critiques existing theories, draws from Sci-Fi and psychology, and proposes a hierarchical, multi-level, mixed-representation architecture with generative learning.

Result: A novel architecture for world modeling and a vision for a PAN AGI system.

Conclusion: The proposed world model aims to simulate actionable possibilities for reasoning and acting, advancing AGI development.

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment
which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging
topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents
with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a
world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.
In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,
and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in
psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on
world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating
all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and
acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a
general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed
continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision
learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)
AGI system enabled by such a model.

TL;DR: Train-before-test improves ranking agreement across benchmarks, enhancing model selection and comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing contradictory model rankings in benchmarks to improve clarity and fairness in model evaluation.

Method: Empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24 benchmarks and 61 models.

Result: Train-before-test significantly improves ranking agreement and external validity, reducing disagreement to near-perfect agreement.

Conclusion: Recommends adopting train-before-test as a default in LLM benchmarking for better consistency.

Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even
for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting
rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion
to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking
disagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,
different models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test
task. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model
the same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary
contribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24
benchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves
ranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have
little external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of
external validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer
gracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,
train-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect
agreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to
essentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of
benchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make
train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.

*Sarthak Ketanbhai Modi,Zi Pong Lim,Yushi Cao,Yupeng Cheng,Yon Shin Teo,Shang-Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOSAE introduces a self-organizing regularization method for autoencoders to dynamically optimize hidden layer size, reducing computational effort compared to grid search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyper-parameter tuning for autoencoders is computationally expensive with grid search, prompting the need for a more efficient method.

Method: SOSAE uses physics-inspired regularization to induce structured sparsity, allowing truncation of non-active feature dimensions without information loss.

Result: SOSAE reduces FLOPs by up to 130x compared to baselines while maintaining tuning quality and performance.

Conclusion: SOSAE offers an efficient alternative to grid search for autoencoder hyper-parameter tuning.

Abstract: The process of tuning the size of the hidden layers for autoencoders has the
benefit of providing optimally compressed representations for the input data.
However, such hyper-parameter tuning process would take a lot of computation
and time effort with grid search as the default option. In this paper, we
introduce the Self-Organization Regularization for Autoencoders that
dynamically adapts the dimensionality of the feature space to the optimal size.
Inspired by physics concepts, Self-Organizing Sparse AutoEncoder (SOSAE)
induces sparsity in feature space in a structured way that permits the
truncation of the non-active part of the feature vector without any loss of
information. This is done by penalizing the autoencoder based on the magnitude
and the positional index of the feature vector dimensions, which during
training constricts the feature space in both terms. Extensive experiments on
various datasets show that our SOSAE can tune the feature space dimensionality
up to 130 times lesser Floating-point Operations (FLOPs) than other baselines
while maintaining the same quality of tuning and performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the heavy reliance of multi-output models on preset distributions and prior knowledge in non-injective regression tasks.

Method: Joint optimization of forward (Φ: X→Y) and backward (Ψ: Y→X) models using cycle consistency loss, eliminating manual rule design or distribution assumptions.

Result: Achieves cycle reconstruction error <0.003 and ~30% improvement in metrics over baselines, supporting unsupervised learning.

Conclusion: The framework reduces manual intervention and shows promise for non-injective regression tasks.

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the heavy reliance of multi-output models
on preset probability distributions and embedded prior knowledge in
non-injective regression tasks, this paper proposes a cycle consistency-based
data-driven training framework. The method jointly optimizes a forward model
{\Phi}: X to Y and a backward model {\Psi}: Y to X, where the cycle consistency
loss is defined as L _cycleb equal L(Y reduce {\Phi}({\Psi}(Y))) (and vice
versa). By minimizing this loss, the framework establishes a closed-loop
mechanism integrating generation and validation phases, eliminating the need
for manual rule design or prior distribution assumptions. Experiments on
normalized synthetic and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves a cycle reconstruction error below 0.003, achieving an
improvement of approximately 30% in evaluation metrics compared to baseline
models without cycle consistency. Furthermore, the framework supports
unsupervised learning and significantly reduces reliance on manual
intervention, demonstrating potential advantages in non-injective regression
tasks.

Method: Proposed HAS-CGAN for 1D force signal generation, optimized in the Fourier domain, and combined with machining parameters to improve prediction accuracy.

Result: HAS-CGAN outperforms other CGAN variants, achieving >0.85 wavelet coherence. Augmented data (520+ samples) reduces prediction error significantly.

Conclusion: HAS-CGAN effectively addresses data scarcity, improving roughness prediction accuracy in ultra-precision machining.

Abstract: Accurate surface roughness prediction in ultra-precision machining (UPM) is
critical for real-time quality control, but small datasets hinder model
performance. We propose HAS-CGAN, a Hybrid Adversarial Spectral Loss CGAN, for
effective UPM data augmentation. Among five CGAN variants tested, HAS-CGAN
excels in 1D force signal generation, particularly for high-frequency signals,
achieving >0.85 wavelet coherence through Fourier-domain optimization. By
combining generated signals with machining parameters, prediction accuracy
significantly improves. Experiments with traditional ML (SVR, RF, LSTM) and
deep learning models (BPNN, 1DCNN, CNN-Transformer) demonstrate that augmenting
training data with 520+ synthetic samples reduces prediction error from 31.4%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NAS methods lack adaptability across scenarios, require costly separate searches, and struggle with performance consistency across platforms.

Method: DANCE reformulates NAS as a continuous evolution problem, using distributions over architectural components, learned selection gates, and a multi-stage training strategy.

Result: DANCE outperforms state-of-the-art NAS methods in accuracy, reduces search costs, and adapts robustly to varying computational constraints.

Conclusion: DANCE offers an effective, adaptable, and cost-efficient solution for NAS, with demonstrated superiority in performance and deployment flexibility.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for
automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical
limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across
scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and
performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We
propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which
reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through
learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three
key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth
adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for
efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective
deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate
DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS
approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs.
Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance
while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements. The

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR) prevents unbounded weight growth in neural networks, improving plasticity and performance without losing learned information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address plasticity loss caused by unbounded weight growth, which harms generalization and optimization, without re-initializing the network.

Method: Proposes SWR, which scales down weights during training to bound their magnitude and balance them across layers.

Result: Theoretically proves SWR bounds weight growth; experiments show improved performance in warm-start, continual, and single-task learning.

Conclusion: SWR effectively maintains plasticity and enhances performance across various learning setups.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that as training progresses, neural networks
gradually lose their capacity to learn new information, a phenomenon known as
plasticity loss. An unbounded weight growth is one of the main causes of
plasticity loss. Furthermore, it harms generalization capability and disrupts
optimization dynamics. Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it
results in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In
this paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that
prevents unbounded weight growth without losing information. SWR recovers the
plasticity of the network by simply scaling down the weight at each step of the
learning process. We theoretically prove that SWR bounds weight magnitude and
balances weight magnitude between layers. Our experiment shows that SWR
improves performance on warm-start learning, continual learning, and
single-task learning setups on standard image classification benchmarks.

Result: Outperforms baselines on UltraFeedback dataset in interpretability and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: CB-RM advances transparent, auditable, and human-aligned reward models.

Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Reward Models (CB-RM), a reward modeling
framework that enables interpretable preference learning through selective
concept annotation. Unlike standard RLHF methods that rely on opaque reward
functions, CB-RM decomposes reward prediction into human-interpretable
concepts. To make this framework efficient in low-supervision settings, we
formalize an active learning strategy that dynamically acquires the most
informative concept labels. We propose an acquisition function based on
Expected Information Gain and show that it significantly accelerates concept
learning without compromising preference accuracy. Evaluated on the
UltraFeedback dataset, our method outperforms baselines in interpretability and
sample efficiency, marking a step towards more transparent, auditable, and
human-aligned reward models.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates GPT-4.1 and o4-mini LLMs for generating optimized BLAS code for CPUs, showing success in correctness and performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of general LLMs in generating and optimizing BLAS code for CPUs, leveraging OpenAI's models.

Method: Tested GPT-4.1 and o4-mini on BLAS routines, generating C code with and without optimizations, and compared performance to reference code.

Result: LLMs generated correct code often, with optimizations like OpenMP, SIMD, and cache blocking improving performance over reference code.

Conclusion: General LLMs like GPT-4.1 and o4-mini can effectively generate and optimize BLAS code, demonstrating potential for automated code generation.

Abstract: Generative AI technology based on Large Language Models (LLM) has been
developed and applied to assist or automatically generate program codes. In
this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs
provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model,
and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released
in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate
(1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic
performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and
cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance
optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that
correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are
given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD
vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that
the code is faster than the reference code.

TL;DR: Normalization layers enable unexpected cross-spatial communication in convolutional architectures, impacting tasks requiring limited receptive fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how normalization layers influence spatial communication in convolutional networks, especially in tasks like localization.

Method: Studied a toy localization task using a convolutional architecture to observe the effects of normalization layers.

Result: Normalization layers facilitate iterative message passing, aggregating information beyond the local receptive field.

Conclusion: Normalization layers should be used cautiously in tasks like diffusion-based trajectory generation where spatial limits are critical.

Abstract: This work shows that normalization layers can facilitate a surprising degree
of communication across the spatial dimensions of an input tensor. We study a
toy localization task with a convolutional architecture and show that
normalization layers enable an iterative message passing procedure, allowing
information aggregation from well outside the local receptive field. Our
results suggest that normalization layers should be employed with caution in
applications such as diffusion-based trajectory generation, where maintaining a
spatially limited receptive field is crucial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs in physics are inadequate, lacking depth and dynamic evaluation to assess true physical reasoning and generalization.

Method: ABench-Physics includes Phy_A (400 static problems) and Phy_B (100 dynamic problems with automatic variation), requiring precise numerical answers.

Result: Evaluation shows significant performance gaps in LLMs, especially in handling dynamic variants, indicating limitations in physical reasoning.

Conclusion: ABench-Physics offers a robust framework to advance LLMs' scientific reasoning by addressing current shortcomings in physical modeling and generalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

*Yong Zhang,Feng Liang,Guanghu Yuan,Min Yang,Chengming Li,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPall addresses feature drift in federated learning by unifying feature spaces and reinforcing class information, improving classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity, especially feature drift, degrades model performance in federated learning, necessitating a solution to unify feature spaces and enhance classification.

Method: FedPall uses prototype-based adversarial learning to unify feature spaces and collaborative learning to reinforce class information, along with mixed features for global classifier enhancement.

Result: FedPall outperforms on feature-drifted datasets, showing superior classification performance in federated learning.

Conclusion: FedPall effectively tackles feature drift in federated learning, improving model performance through unified feature spaces and enhanced classification.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a global model in
the centralized server with data from multiple parties while preserving
privacy. However, data heterogeneity can significantly degrade the performance
of the global model when each party uses datasets from different sources to
train a local model, thereby affecting personalized local models. Among various
cases of data heterogeneity, feature drift, feature space difference among
parties, is prevalent in real-life data but remains largely unexplored. Feature
drift can distract feature extraction learning in clients and thus lead to poor
feature extraction and classification performance. To tackle the problem of
feature drift in FL, we propose FedPall, an FL framework that utilizes
prototype-based adversarial learning to unify feature spaces and collaborative
learning to reinforce class information within the features. Moreover, FedPall
leverages mixed features generated from global prototypes and local features to
enhance the global classifier with classification-relevant information from a
global perspective. Evaluation results on three representative feature-drifted
datasets demonstrate FedPall's consistently superior performance in
classification with feature-drifted data in the FL scenario.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage training method using explanation signals to train reliable models on small datasets, improving accuracy and reducing spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale labeled data is costly, and small datasets lead to variability, overfitting, and spurious correlations. Labels lack reasoning, causing arbitrary learning.

Method: A two-stage training cycle alternates between improving prediction accuracy and refining model attention to match explanations, ensuring models learn label rationale.

Result: The method accelerates convergence to accurate, reliable models, especially for small, imbalanced, or spurious-feature datasets.

Conclusion: Using explanation signals in training enhances model reliability and accuracy for small datasets, addressing key limitations of traditional labeling.

Abstract: Acquiring and training on large-scale labeled data can be impractical due to
cost constraints. Additionally, the use of small training datasets can result
in considerable variability in model outcomes, overfitting, and learning of
spurious correlations. A crucial shortcoming of data labels is their lack of
any reasoning behind a specific label assignment, causing models to learn any
arbitrary classification rule as long as it aligns data with labels. To
overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative approach for training
reliable classification models on smaller datasets, by using simple explanation
signals such as important input features from labeled data. Our method centers
around a two-stage training cycle that alternates between enhancing model
prediction accuracy and refining its attention to match the explanations. This
instructs models to grasp the rationale behind label assignments during their
learning phase. We demonstrate that our training cycle expedites the
convergence towards more accurate and reliable models, particularly for small,
class-imbalanced training data, or data with spurious features.

Motivation: The challenge of integrating custom hardware accelerators into ML compilers due to complex modifications and scheduling needs.

Method: Introduces a TVM-based compilation approach for GEMM accelerators, abstracting integration complexities and using CoSA for automated scheduling.

Result: Benchmarked on Gemmini, the framework matches performance of specialized manual toolchains.

Conclusion: The approach enables seamless accelerator integration without deep compiler expertise, improving efficiency.

Abstract: The growing adoption of domain-specific architectures in edge computing
platforms for deep learning has highlighted the efficiency of hardware
accelerators. However, integrating custom accelerators into modern machine
learning (ML) compilers remains a complex challenge due to the need for
significant modifications in compilation layers and specialized scheduling
techniques. Existing frameworks offer partial solutions and require users to
navigate intricate compiler internals.
  In this paper, we introduce a TVM-based compilation integration approach that
targets GEMM-based deep learning accelerators. Our approach abstracts the
complexities of compiler integration, enabling seamless integration of
accelerators without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying compiler.
Furthermore, we extend and incorporate design space exploration tools,
specifically CoSA, to automate efficient tensor scheduling, accounting for
factors such as uneven mapping and double buffering. Our framework is
benchmarked on the Gemmini accelerator, demonstrating performance comparable to
its specialized manually implemented toolchain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion models is proposed, aligning diffusion trajectories with rewards for improved performance in sequence modeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance discrete diffusion models by aligning them with rewards, inspired by RL's success in language models.

Method: Decomposes the problem into stepwise alignment objectives for efficient optimization, compatible with arbitrary rewards and guarantees optimal solutions under additive reward factorization.

Result: Achieves up to 12% improvement in DNA sequence design and boosts language model scores (e.g., GSM8K from 78.6 to 80.7).

Conclusion: The method effectively optimizes diffusion models, demonstrating superior performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various
sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by
the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further
improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we
propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion
models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying
the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire
discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise
alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization,
is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an
equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory
reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design,
protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement
over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on
DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on
LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.

*Jun Hu,Yufei He,Yuan Li,Bryan Hooi,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NTSFormer is a Graph Transformer framework addressing cold-start node classification by jointly tackling isolation and missing modalities via self-teaching, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods degrade graph learning models for cold-start inference, limiting capacity and struggling with missing modalities.

Method: NTSFormer uses a self-teaching paradigm with cold-start attention masks and multimodal graph pre-computation, processed by MoE Input Projection and Transformer layers.

Result: NTSFormer achieves superior performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks in experiments.

Conclusion: NTSFormer effectively addresses isolation and missing modalities, leveraging Transformer capacity for improved cold-start node classification.

Abstract: Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because
cold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing
modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address
structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start
inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,
this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further
challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose
Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer
framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a
self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention
mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student"
prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and
a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This
enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby
fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To
handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a
one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature
data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.
Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior
performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning small LMs with LoRA on synthetic data outperforms system prompting for conversational tone alignment, achieving high effectiveness with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LMs with specific conversational tones for voice interactions is challenging with system prompts due to limitations like instruction following and bias.

Method: Fine-tuned open-weights (`Llama3.2-1B-Instruct`) and closed-source models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`) using LoRA on synthetic Wikipedia data. Compared fine-tuning to system prompting.

Result: Fine-tuning achieved higher conversational response rates, even with 100 samples, without degrading content quality. 8-bit quantization converged faster than bfloat16.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning small LMs on simulated data is effective and data-efficient for stylistic alignment, preferable to system prompting for nuanced applications.

Abstract: Deploying language models (LMs) in customer-facing speech applications
requires conversational fluency and adherence to specific stylistic guidelines.
This can be challenging to achieve reliably using complex system prompts due to
issues like instruction following limitations and in-context bias. This study
investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning versus system prompting for
aligning LMs with a specific behavioral target: responding in a natural,
conversational tone suitable for voice interactions. We fine-tuned a small,
open-weights model (`Llama3.2-1B-Instruct`) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on
a synthetically generated dataset derived from Wikipedia. Additionally, we
fine-tuned two closed-source models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`). Our
results demonstrate that fine-tuning outperformed system prompting, achieving a
high percentage of conversational responses, even when trained on only 100 data
samples. Semantic similarity analysis confirmed that fine-tuning did not
degrade content quality. Interestingly, fine-tuning with 8-bit integer
quantization converged faster towards the target style than using bfloat16
precision, potentially due to implicit regularization effects. We conclude that
fine-tuning small, open-weights LMs on simulated data is a highly effective and
data-efficient method for instilling specific stylistic behaviors, offering a
preferable alternative to complex system prompting for practical applications
requiring nuanced response styles.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConBatch-BAL, two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition under budget constraints, outperforming unconstrained baselines in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of varying annotation costs and budget constraints in active learning for real-world applications.

Method: Develops two strategies: dynamic thresholding and greedy acquisition, using Bayesian neural networks for uncertainty metrics.

Result: ConBatch-BAL reduces active learning iterations and costs, outperforming unconstrained baselines.

Conclusion: The strategies are effective for costly annotation scenarios, demonstrated on new geospatial datasets.

Abstract: Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder
the adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This
work introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition
under constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one
following greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics
computed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy
redistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the
top-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on
scenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also
release two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of
buildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The
ConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline
on these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show
that the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning
iterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even
outperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores neural network scaling laws through the NTK lens, revealing that similar performance scaling can mask opposite internal dynamics, and investigates the transition between kernel-driven and feature-driven regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind neural network scaling laws and the relationship between performance scaling and internal dynamics.

Method: Empirical analysis of neural networks under data and model scaling using the neural tangent kernel (NTK).

Result: Found that performance scaling alone is insufficient to explain internal dynamics and identified the maximum model width supporting feature learning.

Conclusion: Performance scaling does not fully reveal neural network mechanisms, and feature learning is limited by model width.

Abstract: Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the relationship between neural
network performance and computational cost, yet their underlying mechanisms
remain poorly understood. In this work, we empirically analyze how neural
networks behave under data and model scaling through the lens of the neural
tangent kernel (NTK). This analysis establishes a link between performance
scaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard
vision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even
though the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates
that performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying
mechanisms of neural networks. We also address a previously unresolved issue in
neural scaling: how convergence to the infinite-width limit affects scaling
behavior in finite-width models. To this end, we investigate how feature
learning is lost as the model width increases and quantify the transition
between kernel-driven and feature-driven scaling regimes. We identify the
maximum model width that supports feature learning, which, in our setups, we
find to be more than ten times smaller than typical large language model
widths.

*Maria-Florina Balcan,Saumya Goyal,Dravyansh Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies tuning regularization hyperparameters in linear regression for multiple tasks, providing improved generalization error bounds under specific data distribution assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of tuning regularization hyperparameters in high-dimensional regression, ensuring models avoid overfitting while maintaining effective variable selection.

Method: Analyzes the validation loss for tuning L1 and L2 coefficients (ridge, lasso, elastic net) under distribution-dependent assumptions, including i.i.d. sub-Gaussian data.

Result: Derives sharper generalization bounds that do not degrade with feature dimension under nice data distributions, outperforming prior uniform bounds.

Conclusion: The proposed bounds are tighter for large dimensions and extend to ridge regression variants, leveraging distributional properties for improved performance.

Abstract: Modern regression problems often involve high-dimensional data and a careful
tuning of the regularization hyperparameters is crucial to avoid overly complex
models that may overfit the training data while guaranteeing desirable
properties like effective variable selection. We study the recently introduced
direction of tuning regularization hyperparameters in linear regression across
multiple related tasks. We obtain distribution-dependent bounds on the
generalization error for the validation loss when tuning the L1 and L2
coefficients, including ridge, lasso and the elastic net. In contrast, prior
work develops bounds that apply uniformly to all distributions, but such bounds
necessarily degrade with feature dimension, d. While these bounds are shown to
be tight for worst-case distributions, our bounds improve with the "niceness"
of the data distribution. Concretely, we show that under additional assumptions
that instances within each task are i.i.d. draws from broad well-studied
classes of distributions including sub-Gaussians, our generalization bounds do
not get worse with increasing d, and are much sharper than prior work for very
large d. We also extend our results to a generalization of ridge regression,
where we achieve tighter bounds that take into account an estimate of the mean
of the ground truth distribution.

*Ferdinand Mütsch,Maximilian Zipfl,Nikolai Polley,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised method using graph neural networks to efficiently cluster and search traffic scenarios for AV testing, validated on the nuPlan dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of finding a representative yet manageable subset of scenarios for AV testing, especially accounting for diverse ODDs and the 'long tail' phenomenon.

Method: A heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph model for scenarios, combined with GNNs and contrastive learning for clustering and similarity search.

Result: The model successfully groups related scenarios into meaningful clusters without labeled data, enabling efficient retrieval of representative scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach enhances scalable scenario selection for AV testing, improving efficiency and robustness without manual labeling.

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is an indispensable instrument for the comprehensive
validation and verification of automated vehicles (AVs). However, finding a
manageable and finite, yet representative subset of scenarios in a scalable,
possibly unsupervised manner is notoriously challenging. Our work is meant to
constitute a cornerstone to facilitate sample-efficient testing, while still
capturing the diversity of relevant operational design domains (ODDs) and
accounting for the "long tail" phenomenon in particular. To this end, we first
propose an expressive and flexible heterogeneous, spatio-temporal graph model
for representing traffic scenarios. Leveraging recent advances of graph neural
networks (GNNs), we then propose a self-supervised method to learn a universal
embedding space for scenario graphs that enables clustering and similarity
search. In particular, we implement contrastive learning alongside a
bootstrapping-based approach and evaluate their suitability for partitioning
the scenario space. Experiments on the nuPlan dataset confirm the model's
ability to capture semantics and thus group related scenarios in a meaningful
way despite the absence of discrete class labels. Different scenario types
materialize as distinct clusters. Our results demonstrate how variable-length
traffic scenarios can be condensed into single vector representations that
enable nearest-neighbor retrieval of representative candidates for distinct
scenario categories. Notably, this is achieved without manual labeling or bias
towards an explicit objective such as criticality. Ultimately, our approach can
serve as a basis for scalable selection of scenarios to further enhance the
efficiency and robustness of testing AVs in simulation.

*Tobias Blickhan,Jules Berman,Andrew Stuart,Benjamin Peherstorfer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DICE is a generative modeling method for learning population dynamics from sample data at discrete time points, focusing on smooth population evolution rather than chaotic individual trajectories. It offers stable training and fast sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with chaotic individual trajectories and unstable training. DICE aims to capture smooth population dynamics efficiently.

Method: DICE uses a loss function invariant to spurious constants and evolves samples directly over the time interval, avoiding per-time-step sampling.

Result: DICE trains stably, outperforms other methods in robustness, and generates samples with significantly lower computational costs.

Conclusion: DICE is effective for learning population dynamics, offering stability, efficiency, and broad applicability across diverse problems.

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Inverse Continuity Equation (DICE) method, a
generative modeling approach that learns the evolution of a stochastic process
from given sample populations at a finite number of time points. Models learned
with DICE capture the typically smooth and well-behaved population dynamics,
rather than the dynamics of individual sample trajectories that can exhibit
complex or even chaotic behavior. The DICE loss function is developed
specifically to be invariant, even in discrete time, to spatially constant but
time-varying spurious constants that can emerge during training; this
invariance increases training stability and robustness. Generating a trajectory
of sample populations with DICE is fast because samples evolve directly in the
time interval over which the stochastic process is formulated, in contrast to
approaches that condition on time and then require multiple sampling steps per
time step. DICE is stable to train, in situations where other methods for
learning population dynamics fail, and DICE generates representative samples
with orders of magnitude lower costs than methods that have to condition on
time. Numerical experiments on a wide range of problems from random waves,
Vlasov-Poisson instabilities and high-dimensional chaos are included to justify
these assertions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A tutorial on Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC), focusing on math-code alignment and testing for reliable implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KFAC is widely used but challenging to implement correctly due to complexity and lack of testing.

Method: Provides a step-by-step introduction to KFAC, combining math and code, with test cases based on recent insights.

Result: A contemporary, practical guide to KFAC for easier understanding and implementation.

Conclusion: The tutorial aims to lower barriers for beginners and improve KFAC's practical application.

Abstract: Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) is arguably one of the most
prominent curvature approximations in deep learning. Its applications range
from optimization to Bayesian deep learning, training data attribution with
influence functions, and model compression or merging. While the intuition
behind KFAC is easy to understand, its implementation is tedious: It comes in
many flavours, has common pitfalls when translating the math to code, and is
challenging to test, which complicates ensuring a properly functioning
implementation. Some of the authors themselves have dealt with these challenges
and experienced the discomfort of not being able to fully test their code.
Thanks to recent advances in understanding KFAC, we are now able to provide
test cases and a recipe for a reliable KFAC implementation. This tutorial is
meant as a ground-up introduction to KFAC. In contrast to the existing work,
our focus lies on providing both math and code side-by-side and providing test
cases based on the latest insights into KFAC that are scattered throughout the
literature. We hope this tutorial provides a contemporary view of KFAC that
allows beginners to gain a deeper understanding of this curvature approximation
while lowering the barrier to its implementation, extension, and usage in
practice.

TL;DR: A deep learning method for extracting physical parameters of 2D transistors from electrical measurements, reducing training data needs by 40x and achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate parameter extraction and TCAD fitting for 2D transistors, overcoming limitations of traditional methods.

Method: Uses a neural network trained on physics-based simulations (~500 devices) with data augmentation and pre-training to approximate a device simulator.

Result: Achieves median R² = 0.99 for experimental WS₂ transistors and scales well to fit 35 parameters in high-electron-mobility transistors.

Conclusion: The approach is efficient, accurate, and generalizable, with published code and datasets for future research.

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g.,
mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional
(2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter
extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate
this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by
training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device
simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural
network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500
devices, a factor >40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently,
fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models,
including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic
effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We
apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental
monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination
($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that
this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical
data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters
simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for
inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets
online.

### [284] [Hardware-efficient tractable probabilistic inference for TinyML Neurosymbolic AI applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05141)
*Jelin Leslin,Martin Trapp,Martin Andraud*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for integrating Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) into TinyML hardware by training deterministic probabilistic circuits (PCs), compressing them, and deploying them efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of running symbolic models on resource-constrained TinyML hardware due to their sparsity and computation resolution.

Method: The framework involves (1) training hardware-efficient deterministic PCs, (2) compressing them using an nth-root technique, and (3) deploying the NSAI model on TinyML hardware.

Result: Significant hardware reduction (up to 82.3% in FFs, 52.6% in LUTs, 18.0% in Flash) and a 4.67x inference speedup on ESP32 microcontroller.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables efficient computation of NSAI on TinyML hardware, overcoming previous limitations.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) has recently emerged to mitigate limitations
associated with deep learning (DL) models, e.g. quantifying their uncertainty
or reason with explicit rules. Hence, TinyML hardware will need to support
these symbolic models to bring NSAI to embedded scenarios. Yet, although
symbolic models are typically compact, their sparsity and computation
resolution contrasts with low-resolution and dense neuro models, which is a
challenge on resource-constrained TinyML hardware severely limiting the size of
symbolic models that can be computed. In this work, we remove this bottleneck
leveraging a tight hardware/software integration to present a complete
framework to compute NSAI with TinyML hardware. We focus on symbolic models
realized with tractable probabilistic circuits (PCs), a popular subclass of
probabilistic models for hardware integration. This framework: (1) trains a
specific class of hardware-efficient \emph{deterministic} PCs, chosen for the
symbolic task; (2) \emph{compresses} this PC until it can be computed on TinyML
hardware with minimal accuracy degradation, using our $n^{th}$-root compression
technique, and (3) \emph{deploys} the complete NSAI model on TinyML hardware.
Compared to a 64b precision baseline necessary for the PC without compression,
our workflow leads to significant hardware reduction on FPGA (up to 82.3\% in
FF, 52.6\% in LUTs, and 18.0\% in Flash usage) and an average inference speedup
of 4.67x on ESP32 microcontroller.

*Mingtao Xia,Qijing Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel generalized Wasserstein-2 distance method trains stochastic neural networks to reconstruct random field models, handling mixed continuous and categorical data efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing random field models with mixed data types (continuous and categorical) using stochastic neural networks.

Method: Proposes a generalized local squared Wasserstein-2 loss function for training stochastic neural networks under nonrestrictive conditions.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in uncertainty quantification tasks like classification, distribution reconstruction, and learning noisy dynamical systems.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently approximates random field models and performs well in diverse tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generalized Wasserstein-2 distance approach
for efficiently training stochastic neural networks to reconstruct random field
models, where the target random variable comprises both continuous and
categorical components. We prove that a stochastic neural network can
approximate random field models under a Wasserstein-2 distance metric under
nonrestrictive conditions. Furthermore, this stochastic neural network can be
efficiently trained by minimizing our proposed generalized local squared
Wasserstein-2 loss function. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed
approach in various uncertainty quantification tasks, including classification,
reconstructing the distribution of mixed random variables, and learning complex
noisy dynamical systems from spatiotemporal data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper advocates shifting from a prediction-focused paradigm to an interventionist paradigm for automated decision systems (ADS) to better address their societal impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ADS designs focus on prediction, but their deployment often acts as policy interventions, shaping outcomes and interactions within social systems.

Method: Proposes a new problem setup for ADS, treating predictions as decision support, final decisions, and outcomes, and unifies statistical frameworks to study ADS design and impact.

Result: Highlights limitations of isolated prediction tasks and lays groundwork for an intervention-oriented approach to ADS development and deployment.

Conclusion: A paradigm shift to intervention-focused ADS is necessary, requiring new research directions to operationalize this approach effectively.

Abstract: Many automated decision systems (ADS) are designed to solve prediction
problems -- where the goal is to learn patterns from a sample of the population
and apply them to individuals from the same population. In reality, these
prediction systems operationalize holistic policy interventions in deployment.
Once deployed, ADS can shape impacted population outcomes through an effective
policy change in how decision-makers operate, while also being defined by past
and present interactions between stakeholders and the limitations of existing
organizational, as well as societal, infrastructure and context. In this work,
we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm
to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social
systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond
prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final
decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern
statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and
evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to
operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the
limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation
for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.

*Zhun Deng,Thomas P Zollo,Benjamin Eyre,Amogh Inamdar,David Madras,Richard Zemel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuEst is a framework for combining observed and imputed data to estimate quantile-based distributional measures, providing point estimates and confidence intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hybrid-inference tools are limited to means or single quantiles, restricting their use in critical domains.

Method: QuEst merges observed and imputed data for a wide family of quantile-based measures, including tail risk and population segments, and extends to multidimensional metrics.

Result: The framework is demonstrated in economic modeling, opinion polling, and language model auto-evaluation.

Conclusion: QuEst broadens the applicability of hybrid-inference tools by addressing diverse quantile-based measures.

Abstract: As machine learning models grow increasingly competent, their predictions can
supplement scarce or expensive data in various important domains. In support of
this paradigm, algorithms have emerged to combine a small amount of
high-fidelity observed data with a much larger set of imputed model outputs to
estimate some quantity of interest. Yet current hybrid-inference tools target
only means or single quantiles, limiting their applicability for many critical
domains and use cases. We present QuEst, a principled framework to merge
observed and imputed data to deliver point estimates and rigorous confidence
intervals for a wide family of quantile-based distributional measures. QuEst
covers a range of measures, from tail risk (CVaR) to population segments such
as quartiles, that are central to fields such as economics, sociology,
education, medicine, and more. We extend QuEst to multidimensional metrics, and
introduce an additional optimization technique to further reduce variance in
this and other hybrid estimators. We demonstrate the utility of our framework
through experiments in economic modeling, opinion polling, and language model
auto-evaluation.

### [288] [Cascade: Token-Sharded Private LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05228)
*Rahul Thomas,Louai Zahran,Erica Choi,Akilesh Potti,Micah Goldblum,Arka Pal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cascade is a new multi-party inference protocol for LLMs that balances privacy and performance by sharding in the sequence dimension, offering scalability and resistance to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of third-party LLM inference services raises privacy concerns, and existing secure methods like SMPC are too costly and unscalable.

Method: Cascade uses sharding in the sequence dimension to reduce overhead, trading cryptographic guarantees for speed and scalability.

Result: Cascade is faster than existing schemes, resistant to attacks, and scalable for modern LLMs.

Conclusion: Cascade provides a practical solution for secure, scalable, and efficient third-party LLM inference.

Abstract: As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources
required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party
inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant
computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third
party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate
these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for
third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However,
SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and
do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party
inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging
sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off
cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We
demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack
that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it
is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of
magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions
for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.

### [289] [Logit Reweighting for Topic-Focused Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05235)
*Joschka Braun,Bálint Mucsányi,Seyed Ali Bahrainian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight method improves topical relevance in abstractive summaries by reweighting logits of topic-relevant tokens, outperforming fine-tuning and prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods like fine-tuning are resource-heavy, while simpler approaches often fail to maintain topical focus, especially in smaller models.

Method: Three reweighting techniques (Constant Shift, Factor Scaling, Threshold Selection) are applied to logits of topic-relevant tokens during generation.

Result: Threshold Selection notably enhances topical focus without sacrificing summary quality, as shown on the NEWTS dataset with Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models.

Conclusion: Reweighting logits is a resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, enabling precise control over thematic content in generated text.

Abstract: Generating abstractive summaries that adhere to a specific topic remains a
significant challenge for language models. While standard approaches, such as
fine-tuning, are resource-intensive, simpler methods like prompt engineering
often struggle to maintain topical focus, particularly with smaller models. To
address this, we propose a lightweight method that enhances topical relevance
by directly reweighting the logits of topic-relevant tokens during generation.
We evaluate three such reweighting techniques: Constant Shift, which adds a
constant value to logits; Factor Scaling, which multiplies them by a factor;
and Threshold Selection, which selectively boosts logits that exceed a
probability threshold. Experiments on the NEWTS topical summarization dataset,
using both Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models, show that these techniques
effectively increase the use of topic-relevant vocabulary. Notably, the
Threshold Selection method successfully improves topical focus without
compromising summary quality-a trade-off often seen in other approaches. Our
findings demonstrate that directly reweighting logits is a practical and
resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, offering a promising pathway for
precisely controlling the thematic content of generated text.

*Iqra Farooq,Sara Atito,Ayse Demirkan,Inga Prokopenko,Muhammad Rana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning approach for GWAS outperforms traditional methods by avoiding data leakage and leveraging shared genetic architecture for multi-disease analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GWAS misses nonlinear genetic interactions, and existing deep learning methods risk data leakage or rely on constrained feature selection.

Method: Explores deep learning architectures for GWAS, ensuring no data leakage, and extends to a multi-label framework for joint modeling of five diseases.

Result: Achieves competitive predictive performance (AUC 0.68-0.96) on five million SNPs across 37,000 samples.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable, leakage-free, and biologically meaningful solution for multi-disease GWAS analysis.

Abstract: Traditional GWAS has advanced our understanding of complex diseases but often
misses nonlinear genetic interactions. Deep learning offers new opportunities
to capture complex genomic patterns, yet existing methods mostly depend on
feature selection strategies that either constrain analysis to known pathways
or risk data leakage when applied across the full dataset. Further, covariates
can inflate predictive performance without reflecting true genetic signals. We
explore different deep learning architecture choices for GWAS and demonstrate
that careful architectural choices can outperform existing methods under strict
no-leakage conditions. Building on this, we extend our approach to a
multi-label framework that jointly models five diseases, leveraging shared
genetic architecture for improved efficiency and discovery. Applied to five
million SNPs across 37,000 samples, our method achieves competitive predictive
performance (AUC 0.68-0.96), offering a scalable, leakage-free, and
biologically meaningful approach for multi-disease GWAS analysis.

*Yizhe Xie,Congcong Zhu,Xinyue Zhang,Minghao Wang,Chi Liu,Minglu Zhu,Tianqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper investigates security risks in LLM-based multi-agent systems, focusing on intention-hiding attacks, proposes a detection framework (AgentXposed), and validates its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underexplored security risks in LLM-MAS communication and coordination, particularly intention-hiding threats.

Method: Designs four attack paradigms, evaluates them in different communication structures, and proposes a psychology-based detection framework (AgentXposed) combining HEXACO and Reid Technique.

Result: Attacks disrupt task completion effectively; AgentXposed detects all malicious behaviors, though intention-hiding attacks are slightly harder to detect.

Conclusion: Reveals risks of intention-hiding attacks and offers insights for securing LLM-MAS through psychological perspectives.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate
remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit
strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and
coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically
investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four
representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while
maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized,
decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on
six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic,
and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities.
To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework
AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid
Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based
monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our
detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors.
The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that
of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection,
demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal
the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer
valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through
psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of
multi-agent safety. The code and data are available at

*Thayanne França da Silva,José Everardo Bessa Maia*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A network-based method using time-lagged correlations outperforms traditional information-theoretic approaches (TE, TLMI) in identifying leadership in noisy or short-duration datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of TE and TLMI in inferring leader-follower relationships in noisy or sparse data.

Method: Dynamic network inference using time-lagged correlations across kinematic variables (velocity, acceleration, direction).

Result: Outperforms TE and TLMI in identifying true leaders in simulations with limited data.

Conclusion: The proposed method is robust for leadership inference in noisy or short-duration datasets.

Abstract: Understanding leadership dynamics in collective behavior is a key challenge
in animal ecology, swarm robotics, and intelligent transportation. Traditional
information-theoretic approaches, including Transfer Entropy (TE) and
Time-Lagged Mutual Information (TLMI), have been widely used to infer
leader-follower relationships but face critical limitations in noisy or
short-duration datasets due to their reliance on robust probability
estimations. This study proposes a method based on dynamic network inference
using time-lagged correlations across multiple kinematic variables: velocity,
acceleration, and direction. Our approach constructs directed influence graphs
over time, enabling the identification of leadership patterns without the need
for large volumes of data or parameter-sensitive discretization. We validate
our method through two multi-agent simulations in NetLogo: a modified Vicsek
model with informed leaders and a predator-prey model featuring coordinated and
independent wolf groups. Experimental results demonstrate that the
network-based method outperforms TE and TLMI in scenarios with limited
spatiotemporal observations, ranking true leaders at the top of influence
metrics more consistently than TE and TLMI.

*Luka Van de Sype,Matthieu Vert,Alexei Sharpanskykh,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper investigates how incomplete knowledge of incoming flights and resource allocation strategies affect airport cargo operations post-disaster, using an agent-based model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing natural disaster severity and airport bottlenecks in relief operations highlight the need for better disaster management strategies, particularly addressing information asymmetry and resource scarcity.

Method: An agent-based model is developed, incorporating realistic offloading strategies and varying degrees of information uncertainty. The model is calibrated and verified with field experts.

Result: Unplanned aircraft arrivals have negligible effects individually, but cumulative waiting times increase with more unplanned flights.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of addressing information gaps and resource allocation in airport disaster management to improve operational efficiency.

Abstract: The severity of natural disasters is increasing every year, impacting many
people's lives. During the response phase of disasters, airports are important
hubs where relief aid arrives and people need to be evacuated. However, the
airport often forms a bottleneck in these relief operations due to the sudden
need for increased capacity. Limited research has been done on the operational
side of airport disaster management. Experts identify the main problems as,
first, the asymmetry of information between the airport and incoming flights,
and second, the lack of resources. The goal of this research is to understand
the effects of incomplete knowledge of incoming flights with different resource
allocation strategies on the performance of cargo handling operations at an
airport after a natural disaster. An agent-based model is created, implementing
realistic offloading strategies with different degrees of information
uncertainty. Model calibration and verification are performed with experts in
the field. The model performance is measured by the average turnaround time,
which is divided into offloading time, boarding time, and cumulative waiting
times. The results show that the effects of one unplanned aircraft are
negligible. However, all waiting times increase with more arriving unplanned
aircraft.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: CREW-Wildfire is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM-based multi-agent systems in complex, dynamic tasks like wildfire response, addressing gaps in scalability, robustness, and coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack realism and complexity, limiting the development of next-generation multi-agent AI frameworks.

Method: CREW-Wildfire uses procedurally generated wildfire scenarios with large maps, heterogeneous agents, partial observability, and long-horizon planning. It supports both low-level control and natural language interactions.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based frameworks reveals performance gaps in coordination, communication, spatial reasoning, and planning under uncertainty.

Conclusion: CREW-Wildfire provides a realistic, scalable foundation for advancing research in multi-agent Agentic intelligence.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent
systems, current benchmarks fall short in evaluating their scalability,
robustness, and coordination capabilities in complex, dynamic, real-world
tasks. Existing environments typically focus on small-scale, fully observable,
or low-complexity domains, limiting their utility for developing and assessing
next-generation multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks. We introduce CREW-Wildfire,
an open-source benchmark designed to close this gap. Built atop the human-AI
teaming CREW simulation platform, CREW-Wildfire offers procedurally generated
wildfire response scenarios featuring large maps, heterogeneous agents, partial
observability, stochastic dynamics, and long-horizon planning objectives. The
environment supports both low-level control and high-level natural language
interactions through modular Perception and Execution modules. We implement and
evaluate several state-of-the-art LLM-based multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks,
uncovering significant performance gaps that highlight the unsolved challenges
in large-scale coordination, communication, spatial reasoning, and long-horizon
planning under uncertainty. By providing more realistic complexity, scalable
architecture, and behavioral evaluation metrics, CREW-Wildfire establishes a
critical foundation for advancing research in scalable multi-agent Agentic
intelligence. All code, environments, data, and baselines will be released to
support future research in this emerging domain.
