To protect\nintellectual property of DNNs, it is desirable to build undistillable DNNs. To\nthis end, it is first observed that an undistillable DNN may have the trait\nthat each cluster of its output probability distributions in response to all\nsample instances with the same label should be highly concentrated to the\nextent that each cluster corresponding to each label should ideally collapse\ninto one probability distribution. Based on this observation and by measuring\nthe concentration of each cluster in terms of conditional mutual information\n(CMI), a new training method called CMI minimized (CMIM) method is proposed,\nwhich trains a DNN by jointly minimizing the conventional cross entropy (CE)\nloss and the CMI values of all temperature scaled clusters across the entire\ntemperature spectrum. The resulting CMIM model is shown, by extensive\nexperiments, to be undistillable by all tested KD methods existing in the\nliterature. That is, the knockoff students distilled by these KD methods from\nthe CMIM model underperform the respective LS students. In addition, the CMIM\nmodel is also shown to performs better than the model trained with the CE loss\nalone in terms of their own prediction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a method to create undistillable DNNs by minimizing conditional mutual information (CMI) during training, ensuring knockoff students underperform label-smoothed ones.", "motivation": "To protect DNN intellectual property by making models undistillable through knowledge distillation.", "method": "Proposes the CMI Minimized (CMIM) method, training DNNs by jointly minimizing cross-entropy loss and CMI values of temperature-scaled clusters.", "result": "CMIM models are undistillable by tested KD methods and outperform models trained with cross-entropy alone in prediction accuracy.", "conclusion": "The CMIM method effectively creates undistillable DNNs while maintaining or improving model performance."}}

Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID\nbased on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2)\nguiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3)\niteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in\nboth code execution and mobile device control tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "CIP uses causal influence diagrams (CIDs) to improve safety in LLM-powered autonomous agents by structuring decision-making and mitigating risks.", "motivation": "Ensuring safe and reliable behavior in LLM-powered agents to prevent unintended consequences.", "method": "Three-step approach: (1) initialize CID for task, (2) guide agent interactions using CID, (3) iteratively refine CID based on outcomes.", "result": "Enhanced safety in code execution and mobile device control tasks.", "conclusion": "CIP effectively improves agent safety through structured causal reasoning."}}
