Here,\nwe present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that\nexplicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives.

A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies\nlearning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,\npolynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)\nand Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible\ntrajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our\napproach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,\ncyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods\nin reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance.

However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of\nhyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often\ndifficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts\nhave been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide\nrange of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we\nintroduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art\noptimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size\nhyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto\nand Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that\nattains the standard convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$ under less\nrestrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or\nassumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to\nprevious approaches.

This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs\nagainst base models concerning monosemanticity.

Using\nGemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs\nreduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability.

Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only\nin sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used\nmachine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve\nindividual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as\nincorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these\nmethods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees\nof fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees\nprimarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce\ndefinitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance\nindividual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a\nnovel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout\ntraining. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair\ninitialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a\nfairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model\nlearns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response\nmechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness\nguarantees.

To formalize this setting,\nwe introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the\nagent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In\nthis context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a\ndata-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural\nlanguage during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over\nnatural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different\ncomplex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over\ncandidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and\nuncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate\nGOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated\nhousehold robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our\nmethod outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by\nboth LLM-based and human evaluations."}

Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its\ntwo common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary\nlimitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly\nto collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,\npreferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior\ncontribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.\nIn this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to\nunify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled\ntrajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert\ndemonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their\nsimilarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference\nlearning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches\nstruggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning\nfrom preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage\nboth feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks."}

To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks\nframework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by\npartitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main\ncontributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in\nwhich the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of\nblocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive\nmodel through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided\nDirect Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its\nreasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count\nto dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible\nadjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment."}

In this work, we\ninvestigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted\nthat are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing\nthe policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents\ntend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the\nlikelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a\nmethod based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each\nagent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.\nSpecifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies\nby assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis\nacross cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to\nwhich agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects\nbetween policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent\nbehaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic\ndecisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices.
