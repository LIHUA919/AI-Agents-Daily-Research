(2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a\ndataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual\nexpansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and\ngenerate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a\nchallenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a\ntwo-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the\nmodel with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive\nAlignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to\nachieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We\nintroduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with\ndiverse reasoning step distributions.

It is constructed with LLM pipelines\nfor discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing\ninformation in concise fair-use facts. \\ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million\npairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.\nSMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,\nCLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets\nand evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \\ourdataset~is\nhighly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised\nprediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M\nlearnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and\nclassification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.\nModels built with \\ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for\nnovel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly\nas effective. We release our dataset at\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},\nand will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a dataset of priors for AI-driven therapeutic design, extracted from literature, to improve model safety and effectiveness. It shows superior performance over larger models in tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons.", "motivation": "AI-driven discovery often violates implicit constraints due to lack of experimental priors, leading to unsafe or ineffective designs. This work aims to address this by leveraging literature-derived priors.", "method": "The dataset, constructed using LLM pipelines, contains 32.3 million pairs of natural language facts and entity representations. Models like LLM, CLIP, and LLava are trained to reason jointly about text and design targets.", "result": "Models pretrained with the dataset outperform larger models (e.g., 2B TxGemma) in TDC tasks and produce safer, effective molecule proposals in GuacaMol.", "conclusion": "The dataset enhances AI-driven therapeutic design by providing strong priors, improving safety and performance. It is publicly available and will expand with growing literature."}}
