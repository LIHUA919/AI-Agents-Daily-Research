### [1] [Unifying Post-hoc Explanations of Knowledge Graph Completions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22951)
*Alessandro Lonardi,Samy Badreddine,Tarek R. Besold,Pablo Sanchez Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework for post-hoc explainability in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), balancing effectiveness and conciseness, and suggests improved evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of formalization and consistent evaluations in post-hoc explainability for KGC hinders reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.

Method: A general framework for post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, unifying existing algorithms, and improved evaluation protocols using metrics like Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@k.

Result: The framework unifies existing methods and refines evaluation standards, making KGC explainability research more reproducible and impactful.

Conclusion: By unifying methods and refining evaluations, the work aims to enhance the reproducibility and impact of KGC explainability research.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

### [2] [Data Readiness for Scientific AI at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23018)
*Wesley Brewer,Patrick Widener,Valentine Anantharaj,Feiyi Wang,Tom Beck,Arjun Shankar,Sarp Oral*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) in leadership-scale scientific datasets, proposing a two-dimensional framework (Data Readiness Levels and Data Processing Stages) for HPC environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in preparing scientific data for AI training, especially for transformer-based generative models, across domains like climate, fusion, bio/health, and materials.

Method: Analyzes workflows in four domains, introduces a readiness framework with tailored Data Readiness Levels and Processing Stages for HPC.

Result: A conceptual maturity matrix to guide standardized, cross-domain AI-ready data infrastructure.

Conclusion: The framework aids in scalable, reproducible AI for science by addressing data transformation challenges.

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for
scalable and reproducible AI for science.

### [3] [FairReason: Balancing Reasoning and Social Bias in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23067)
*Zhenyu Pan,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haoran Lu,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores balancing reasoning ability and bias mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), identifying a 1:4 mix of debias and reasoning samples with reinforcement learning as optimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between improving reasoning and reducing social biases in MLLMs, which remains an unresolved issue.

Method: Benchmarked three bias-mitigation strategies (SFT, KD, RL) and varied sample proportions to analyze the reasoning-bias trade-off.

Result: A 1:4 mix trained with RL reduced biases by 10% while retaining 88% of reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical guidance for balancing fairness and capability in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

### [4] [Moravec's Paradox: Towards an Auditory Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23091)
*David Noever,Forrest McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI systems perform poorly on auditory tasks humans handle easily, with a 93% failure rate in tests. The study highlights gaps in selective attention and noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by Moravec's paradox, the study aims to quantify the gap between human and machine auditory capabilities and identify AI shortcomings.

Method: An auditory Turing test with 917 challenges across seven categories was used to evaluate state-of-the-art audio models like GPT-4 and Whisper.

Result: AI models failed 93% of tasks, with the best achieving only 6.9% accuracy vs. humans' 52%. Key issues include selective attention and noise robustness.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for new AI approaches integrating selective attention and context-aware perception to bridge the human-machine auditory gap.

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

### [5] [Argumentatively Coherent Judgmental Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23163)
*Deniz Gorur,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'argumentative coherence' in judgmental forecasting, showing its practical value in improving accuracy for both humans and LLMs, while noting users often don't align with it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the role of argumentative coherence in judgmental forecasting and its impact on accuracy.

Method: Formally define coherence, evaluate its impact on human and LLM forecasters, and conduct user experiments.

Result: Filtering incoherent predictions improves accuracy; users don't naturally align with coherence.

Conclusion: Mechanisms to filter incoherent opinions are needed in argumentation-based forecasting.

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

### [6] [Tractable Responsibility Measures for Ontology-Mediated Query Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23191)
*Meghyn Bienvenu,Diego Figueira,Pierre Lafourcade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the complexity of computing Shapley-value-based responsibility scores (WSMS) in ontology-mediated query answering, showing polynomial data complexity for first-order-rewritable queries but intractability for certain ontology languages. It identifies tractable cases for DL-Lite dialects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the contributions of facts to query answers using responsibility measures, particularly in ontology-mediated query answering, and understand the computational complexity of these measures.

Method: Exploits database results to analyze WSMS complexity, focusing on first-order-rewritable queries and ontology languages. Studies combined complexity for atomic and conjunctive queries.

Result: Polynomial data complexity for first-order-rewritable queries; intractability for languages encoding reachability. Tractable cases identified for DL-Lite dialects.

Conclusion: The study delineates the tractability frontier for WSMS computation, providing insights into feasible and intractable scenarios in ontology-mediated query answering.

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

### [7] [Solution-aware vs global ReLU selection: partial MILP strikes back for DNN verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23197)
*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a divide-and-conquer approach using partial MILP calls and introduces a solution-aware ReLU scoring (SAS) method to efficiently select critical ReLU variables, reducing binary variables by 6x while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of previous methods in handling complex verification instances by optimizing the selection of ReLU variables.

Method: Uses a hybrid approach: first applies α,β-CROWN with a short timeout, then partial MILP. Introduces SAS for ReLU scoring and adapts BaB-SR and BaB-FSB as global scoring functions.

Result: SAS reduces binary variables by 6x, maintains accuracy, and reduces undecided instances by 40% (to 8-15%). Runtime remains reasonable (46s-417s per instance).

Conclusion: The proposed Hybrid MILP with SAS is an efficient and accurate verifier, even for large CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

bottlenecks and the critical components required for the emergence of a
scientific agent capable of producing ground-breaking discoveries that solve
grand challenges. We hope this survey will contribute to a clearer

Method: Evaluates three LLMs (Claude-4.0-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Flash, OpenAI-o4-Mini) across three approaches (zero-shot, multi-step, SmolAgent) on eight task categories, testing sensitivity to prompting issues and temperature parameters.

Result: Reveals distinct performance disparities among models and methodologies, highlighting critical deployment factors.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a foundation for future research on robust and effective data science agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation
for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

*Tosin Adewumi,Lama Alkhaled,Florent Imbert,Hui Han,Nudrat Habib,Karl Löwenmark*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues against fully autonomous AI (level 3) due to risks, advocating for human oversight, supported by theories, arguments, and evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the risks of fully autonomous AI and emphasize the need for human oversight, especially with the potential rise of artificial superintelligence (ASI).

Method: Discusses theories of autonomy, AI, and agents; presents 12 arguments, 6 counterarguments with rebuttals, and 15 pieces of evidence on AI risks.

Result: Identifies 3 levels of autonomous AI, stressing the dangers of level 3 (fully autonomous) without human oversight.

Conclusion: Fully autonomous AI is too risky; responsible human oversight is essential to mitigate potential harms.

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

*Zhuo Li,Xianghuai Deng,Chiwei Feng,Hanmeng Li,Shenjie Wang,Haichao Zhang,Teng Jia,Conlin Chen,Louis Linchun Wu,Jia Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM4Rail is a railway service platform using LLMs for personalized services like ticketing, food recommendations, and chitchat, employing the QTAO framework and a zero-shot recommender for onboard dining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet the demand for individualized railway services by leveraging LLMs for accurate and personalized responses.

Method: Developed the QTAO prompting framework for reasoning-guided actions and introduced a zero-shot conversational recommender with post-processing for railway food recommendations.

Result: Created the CRFD-25 dataset for railway catering and demonstrated effective personalized service delivery.

Conclusion: LLM4Rail successfully integrates LLMs for tailored railway services, showcasing the potential of LLMs in specialized domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

*Mingzhe Li,Xin Lu,Yanyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-Foveate is an LLM-driven method for synthesizing diverse and challenging instructions from unsupervised text, using a multi-level foveation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for instruction synthesis lack diversity and difficulty, relying heavily on human effort or limited automation.

Method: Proposes 'Micro-Scatter-Macro' multi-level foveation to guide LLMs in extracting fine-grained information from text.

Result: Validated across multiple corpora and architectures, showing effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: Self-Foveate enhances instruction synthesis, with data and code publicly released.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

### [14] [Causal Reasoning in Pieces: Modular In-Context Learning for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23488)
*Kacper Kadziolka,Saber Salehkaleybar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Advanced reasoning models like OpenAI's o-series and DeepSeek-R show significant improvements in causal discovery, especially with structured in-context pipelines, outperforming conventional methods by nearly three-fold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of causal inference in large language models and the potential of reasoning-first architectures to address overfitting and poor performance under data perturbations.

Method: Study causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using reasoning models, introduce a modular in-context pipeline inspired by Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts, and analyze reasoning chain length and complexity.

Result: Reasoning models achieve significantly better performance than prior approaches, with the in-context pipeline yielding nearly three-fold improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: Advanced reasoning models are a leap forward, but structured in-context frameworks are crucial to maximize their potential, providing a generalizable approach for causal discovery.

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

### [15] [Causal Identification of Sufficient, Contrastive and Complete Feature Sets in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23497)
*David A Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces causal explanations for image classifiers, combining formal rigor with practical computability, and proposes contrastive and complete causal explanations with confidence awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanation methods for image classifiers lack formal rigor or rely on impractical assumptions. Causal explanations offer a rigorous yet computable alternative.

Method: The authors define causal explanations, prove their formal properties, and introduce contrastive and complete causal explanations. They implement these definitions in a black-box algorithm.

Result: Experiments show varying patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and completeness across models. The algorithm is efficient (6s per image on ResNet50) and fully black-box.

Conclusion: Causal explanations provide a rigorous, computable, and practical solution for explaining image classifier outputs, with efficient and black-box implementation.

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

### [16] [DICE: Dynamic In-Context Example Selection in LLM Agents via Efficient Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23554)
*Ruoyu Wang,Junda Wu,Yu Xia,Tong Yu,Ryan A. Rossi,Julian McAuley,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DICE introduces a dynamic, theoretically grounded method for selecting in-context demonstrations to improve LLM agent performance by decomposing knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing in-context learning (ICL) methods for LLM agents are sensitive to demonstration choices, lacking a general, principled approach for effective selection across reasoning steps.

Method: DICE decomposes demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components using a causal lens, proposing a stepwise selection criterion with performance guarantees.

Result: Extensive experiments show DICE's effectiveness and generality, improving agent performance without additional training costs.

Conclusion: Principled, context-aware demonstration selection is crucial for robust and efficient LLM agents, as demonstrated by DICE.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient

### [17] [Semantic Chain-of-Trust: Autonomous Trust Orchestration for Collaborator Selection via Hypergraph-Aided Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23565)
*Botao Zhu,Xianbin Wang,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an autonomous trust orchestration method using agentic AI and hypergraph for efficient trust evaluation in collaborative systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the complexity and resource consumption of trust evaluations in distributed collaboration due to task complexity, dynamic device resources, and assessment overhead.

Method: Uses agentic AI and hypergraph to autonomously perceive device states, perform trust evaluations during idle periods, and analyze task-specific resource alignment. Maintains a trust hypergraph for hierarchical management and multi-hop collaboration.

Result: Achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation, balancing overhead and accuracy.

Conclusion: The method enables efficient utilization of distributed resources and supports large-scale collaboration.

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

### [18] [MemoCue: Empowering LLM-Based Agents for Human Memory Recall via Strategy-Guided Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23633)
*Qian Zhao,Zhuo Sun,Bin Guo,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, MemoCue, which uses a Recall Router framework to enhance memory recall by transforming queries into cue-rich ones. It outperforms LLM-based methods by 17.74%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional memory recall methods are limited by memory module size, hindering complete memory acquisition. Memory theories suggest proactive activation of memories through cues, inspiring the proposed method.

Method: A Recall Router framework is introduced, featuring a 5W Recall Map for query classification and fifteen recall strategy patterns. A hierarchical recall tree with Monte Carlo Tree Search optimizes strategy selection and response generation. MemoCue, an LLM-based agent, is fine-tuned for memory-inspired responses.

Result: Experiments show MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall inspiration. Human evaluation confirms its effectiveness in memory-recall applications.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses challenges in agent-assisted memory recall, demonstrating superior performance and practical utility.

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

*Haipeng Liu,Yuxuan Liu,Ting Long*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAR improves personalized question recommendation by integrating collaborative ideas into exploration, outperforming traditional RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based methods struggle with efficient exploration, limiting their ability to recommend optimal questions for students.

Method: Proposes Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), incorporating collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism for better efficiency.

Result: RAR enhances recommendation performance and is adaptable to any RL-based recommender.

Conclusion: RAR offers a scalable and effective solution for personalized question recommendation.

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TextQuests is a new benchmark based on interactive fiction games to evaluate AI agents' intrinsic long-context reasoning and autonomous problem-solving in exploratory environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the ability to assess AI agents' autonomous reasoning in long-horizon, exploratory tasks.

Method: TextQuests uses Infocom's interactive fiction games, requiring precise actions and long sessions, to test agents without external tools.

Result: The benchmark evaluates agents' self-contained problem-solving and trial-and-error learning in long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: TextQuests aims to advance AI agents' intrinsic reasoning capabilities in complex, exploratory environments.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with theorem proving due to unclear supervision signals in natural language. Formal verification via Lean provides clear supervision, enabling effective training.

Method: Seed-Prover iteratively refines proofs using Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. Three test-time inference strategies are designed for deep and broad reasoning. Seed-Geometry is introduced for geometry support.

Result: Seed-Prover proves 78.1% of formalized IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and achieves >50% on PutnamBench. Seed-Geometry outperforms previous formal geometry engines.

Conclusion: The work advances automated mathematical reasoning by combining formal verification with long chain-of-thought reasoning, demonstrated by high success rates in IMO 2025.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

Method: Uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning to generate and filter synthetic prompts from seed tasks, ensuring quality and complexity.

Result: Outperforms existing datasets (e.g., s1k, OpenMathReasoning) in verifiable reasoning tasks and human/standard prompts in instruction-following tasks.

Conclusion: CoT-Self-Instruct effectively enhances LLM performance by generating superior synthetic training data.

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that
instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the
given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar
quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for
high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our
synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as
s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For
non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the
performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0

TL;DR: SimuRA introduces a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning, overcoming autoregressive LLM limitations with world-model-based planning, achieving significant success in web browsing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents are limited by one-task-one-agent approaches and autoregressive LLMs, lacking scalability and generality. Humans, however, reason by simulating outcomes, inspiring a more general AI agent.

Method: SimuRA uses a world model for planning via simulation, implemented with LLMs, enabling flexible planning in diverse environments using natural language's latent space.

Result: SimuRA improved flight search success from 0% to 32.2%, with world-model-based planning showing up to 124% advantage over autoregressive methods.

Conclusion: SimuRA demonstrates the potential for a single, general LLM-based agent capable of superintelligent action across environments, with a web-browsing agent available for public testing.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

*Ridvan Yesiloglu,Wei Peng,Md Tauhidul Islam,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAR, a generative autoregressive transformer model, predicts brain aging trajectories from MRI scans, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like LDM and GANs in fidelity and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain aging synthesis is crucial for clinical and computational neuroscience, but challenges like high-dimensional data and subtle structural changes hinder accurate predictions.

Method: NeuroAR uses autoregressive transformers to synthesize aging brains by estimating future scan token maps from past and future scan embeddings, guided by subject-specific data and age information via cross-attention.

Result: NeuroAR outperforms LDM and GANs in image fidelity and realism, validated by a pre-trained age predictor, demonstrating superior modeling of subject-specific aging trajectories.

Conclusion: NeuroAR is a highly effective model for synthesizing brain aging, offering significant improvements over existing generative methods.

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Motivation: Address gaps in prior research on language coverage, cognitive context, and granularity of LLM involvement in detecting cheating.

Method: Dataset of 69 participants completing writing tasks under three conditions (bona fide, paraphrasing, transcribing) across six cognitive processes. Temporal and rhythmic features are extracted and evaluated under Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.

Result: Temporal features excel in Cognition-Aware scenarios, while rhythmic features generalize better. Models outperform humans, especially in detecting paraphrased responses.

Conclusion: Keystroke dynamics reliably detect LLM-assisted writing across cognitive demands and strategies, including paraphrasing and transcribing.

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of MLPs (poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, difficulty capturing localized/high-frequency features) motivate the adoption of KANs, which offer enhanced interpretability and flexibility.

Method: The review categorizes KAN-based models into three perspectives: data-driven learning, physics-informed modeling, and deep operator learning. It examines architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and comparative evaluation against MLPs.

Result: KANs consistently outperform MLPs in accuracy, convergence, and spectral representation, demonstrating better capability in capturing complex dynamics.

Conclusion: The paper identifies challenges (computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees, hyperparameter tuning) and outlines future research directions to improve KAN robustness, scalability, and physical consistency.

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaSwarm is a dynamic multi-agent system (MAS) framework that improves adaptability and performance by optimizing graph structures with A2C reinforcement learning and a dynamic graph selector, outperforming static MAS and single-agent baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAS frameworks use static collaboration graphs, limiting adaptability and performance. DynaSwarm aims to overcome this by dynamically optimizing graph structures.

Method: DynaSwarm uses (1) an A2C reinforcement learning mechanism for stable graph optimization and (2) a dynamic graph selector for sample-specific routing. It also fine-tunes the demonstration retriever for in-context learning.

Result: Experiments on question answering, math reasoning, and coding tasks show DynaSwarm outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS baselines.

Conclusion: Sample-aware structural flexibility is crucial for LLM-based MAS, as demonstrated by DynaSwarm's superior performance.

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-hazard forecasting framework for agriculture using deep learning and XAI, validated with US meteorological data, achieving strong predictive accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate extremes are increasing risks to agriculture, requiring adaptive EWS. Traditional methods fail to capture complex interactions among concurrent events.

Method: Combines sequential deep learning (e.g., BiLSTM) and XAI (TimeSHAP) to create a multi-hazard forecasting framework, tested on US agricultural data (2010-2023).

Result: Demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, especially with BiLSTM, and provides temporal explanations for climatic feature impacts.

Conclusion: Advances explainable multi-hazard EWS, aiding proactive risk management and interdisciplinary trust in agriculture.

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Conclusion: FedCVD++ is the first practical integration of non-parametric models into federated healthcare, offering privacy-preserving, scalable, and high-performance solutions for CVD risk prediction.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural

disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into

*Tatsuya Mitomi,Fumiyasu Makinoshima,Fumiya Makihara,Eigo Segawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a differentiable agent-based simulation for dynamic pricing in bike-sharing systems to balance inventory, outperforming conventional methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bike-sharing systems face imbalanced inventory due to spatiotemporal demand variations, requiring dynamic pricing to manage user demand efficiently.

Method: Develops a differentiable agent-based simulation to design dynamic pricing, validated through numerical experiments and large-scale urban scenarios.

Result: Achieves 73-78% loss reduction, 100x faster convergence, and balanced inventory without manual relocation.

Conclusion: Optimal dynamic pricing can balance bike inventory efficiently, with minimized discount costs through proper initial conditions.

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

TL;DR: GSM-UTCI, a deep learning model, predicts hyperlocal UTCI with high accuracy and speed, aiding urban heat mitigation planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cities need scalable tools to assess and mitigate outdoor heat stress due to climate change and urbanization, as traditional models are computationally intensive.

Method: GSM-UTCI uses multimodal data (nDSM, land cover, meteorology) with a FiLM architecture to predict UTCI, trained on SOLWEIG-derived maps.

Result: Achieves R2 of 0.9151 and MAE of 0.41°C, reducing inference time to under five minutes. Applied to Philadelphia, tree canopy scenarios show significant cooling.

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI is a scalable, precise tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling efficient evaluation of greening strategies.

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

### [32] [Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests, Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23009)
*Tom Sühr,Florian E. Dorner,Olawale Salaudeen,Augustin Kelava,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues against using human psychological tests to evaluate LLMs, calling for AI-specific evaluation frameworks instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human tests are theory-driven and calibrated for humans, making them unsuitable for evaluating AI traits like intelligence.

Method: The paper critiques current practices and highlights issues like validity, data contamination, and cultural bias in using human tests for AI.

Result: Mischaracterization of AI traits occurs when human tests are applied without empirical validation.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for developing principled, AI-specific tests to accurately evaluate AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

### [33] [Investigating the Invertibility of Multimodal Latent Spaces: Limitations of Optimization-Based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23010)
*Siwoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores inverse capabilities of multimodal latent spaces in AI models, finding them chaotic and semantically incoherent despite optimization efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether multimodal latent spaces, optimized for forward tasks, can support meaningful inverse mappings.

Method: An optimization-based framework is applied bidirectionally across Text-Image and Text-Audio modalities to infer input characteristics from outputs.

Result: Inverse mappings are textually aligned but perceptually chaotic and semantically incoherent, lacking interpretability.

Conclusion: Multimodal latent spaces lack inherent structure for robust inverse mappings, highlighting the need for further research into invertible spaces.

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

*Xueying Wu,Baijun Zhou,Zhihui Gao,Yuzhe Fu,Qilin Zheng,Yintao He,Hai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KLLM is a hardware-software co-design framework addressing challenges in weight and activation quantization for LLM inference, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WAQ designs face accuracy degradation and inefficiency due to uniform quantization and activation outliers.

Method: KLLM uses index-based computation for K-Means-quantized data and an outlier detection engine (Orizuru) for efficient online inference.

Result: KLLM achieves significant speedups (9.67x, 7.03x) and energy efficiency improvements (229.50x, 150.21x) over A100 GPU and Atom.

Conclusion: KLLM effectively enhances LLM inference efficiency and accuracy through innovative quantization and outlier handling.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

*Aurélie Leribaux,Rafael Oyamada,Johannes De Smedt,Zahra Dasht Bozorgi,Artem Polyvyanyy,Jochen De Weerdt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper integrates actor behavior analysis with Granger causality to study temporal and causal dynamics in process mining, revealing direct impacts of actor behavior on process performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional process mining overlooks temporal and causal dynamics from individual actor behavior, limiting understanding of real-world process complexity.

Method: Uses Granger causality and Group Lasso for lag selection on time series data of actor interactions and process outcomes.

Result: Identifies influential lags showing actor behavior directly impacts process performance, especially throughput time.

Conclusion: Actor-centric, time series methods offer nuanced insights into how individual behaviors drive process efficiency.

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning model was developed to predict vancomycin-related kidney injury in ICU patients using routine data, achieving strong accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity is challenging but crucial for timely interventions in critically ill patients.

Method: Analyzed 10,288 ICU patients from MIMIC-IV, selected features via SelectKBest and Random Forest, and tested six algorithms with cross-validation. Interpretability was assessed using SHAP, ALE, and Bayesian methods.

Result: CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818), with phosphate, bilirubin, and Charlson index as key predictors. SHAP and ALE provided insights into risk factors and dose-response patterns.

Conclusion: The model offers accurate, interpretable predictions for vancomycin-associated kidney injury, aiding early risk detection and intervention in critical care.

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores local differential privacy in the thresholding bandit problem, proposing methods with strong privacy guarantees and theoretical performance bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in bandit problems by ensuring local differential privacy while identifying high-reward arms.

Method: Uses a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism for private responses in fixed budget and fixed confidence settings.

Result: The algorithms provide strong privacy guarantees and match lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: The work offers insights into privacy-preserving decision-making in bandit problems.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed
confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses,
obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based foundation model for fracture prediction unifies diverse materials and loading conditions, reducing data needs and improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate fracture prediction is crucial for safe design but is challenging due to diverse materials and conditions. Existing ML models lack robustness, and physics-based simulators are resource-intensive.

Method: A transformer-based architecture combines multimodal inputs (structured/unstructured meshes and text embeddings) to adapt flexibly across simulations without architectural changes.

Result: The model generalizes to unseen materials with minimal data, excels in tasks like time-to-failure estimation, and reduces data needs compared to standard ML.

Conclusion: The model offers a scalable, extensible solution for fracture prediction, unifying diverse scenarios under one architecture.

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates the performance and energy usage of edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson nano) for AI inferences, focusing on trade-offs between model accuracy, inference time, power, and memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of comprehensive studies on edge device performance and energy usage for AI applications motivates this research to aid informed device and model selection.

Method: The study rigorously characterizes traditional, neural network, and large language model performance on edge devices, analyzing trade-offs in F1 score, inference time, power, and memory.

Result: Findings highlight how hardware/framework optimizations and model parameter tuning can balance performance and resource usage for practical edge AI deployments.

Conclusion: The research provides insights for optimizing edge AI deployments by addressing performance-energy trade-offs in device and model selection.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

*Richard Williams,Eric Nalisnick,Andrew Holbrook*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiGG-E is an autoregressive model extending BiGG to learn joint distributions over weighted graphs, addressing dependencies between edges and weights efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep generative models for weighted graphs either ignore joint distributions with topology or fail to handle nonlocal dependencies between edges and weights.

Method: BiGG-E extends BiGG, leveraging sparsity to generate weighted graphs in O((n + m)log n) time, learning joint distributions over edges and weights.

Result: BiGG-E outperforms benchmarks in capturing weighted graph distributions, remaining scalable and efficient.

Conclusion: BiGG-E effectively models weighted graphs, addressing prior limitations and demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLOSS mitigates bias and performance degradation in federated learning caused by missing data from stragglers and user opt-out.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern data privacy agreements allow users to opt out of sharing data, and heterogeneous device capabilities cause stragglers, leading to biased and degraded model performance.

Method: The paper presents FLOSS, a system designed to address missing data issues in federated learning due to stragglers and user opt-out.

Result: FLOSS is empirically demonstrated to improve performance in simulations.

Conclusion: FLOSS effectively reduces the negative impacts of missing data in federated learning systems.

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

Motivation: Prior work in computer vision shows correlations between ID and OOD accuracies, but this relationship is underexplored in audio-based models.

Method: Benchmarking neural architectures across evaluation sets, using Fairness (F) and Robustness (R) metrics to quantify noise impact.

Result: Noise-aware training improves robustness in some configurations.

Conclusion: The study highlights the benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in speech models.

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, such
relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we
investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness
and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD
conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of
evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use
of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the
benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in
speech models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of multiple models performing equally well but yielding conflicting predictions, undermining interpretability and safety.

Method: Proposes a regret measure for probabilistic classification, with a general-purpose method to estimate it.

Result: Shows higher regret for certain groups and discusses applications like abstention and data collection for safety.

Conclusion: Estimating regret can enhance safety and interpretability in probabilistic classification tasks.

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI paradigm for solving differential equations (DEs) with a focus on addressing high-frequency component approximation challenges. It introduces a first-principles data generation method and a scale-dilation operator (SDO) AI solver, achieving superior accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI solvers struggle with high-frequency component approximation and data scarcity. The paper aims to develop a more efficient and accurate AI-based solution for diverse DEs.

Method: The method involves generating first-principles-consistent training datasets using prior knowledge or random fields, and introducing a reversible SDO to address high-frequency issues. A Transformer-based AI solver with SDO is designed for spatiotemporally coupled DEs.

Result: Extensive tests show the proposed AI paradigm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy. The SDO also smooths the loss landscape, improving training efficiency.

Conclusion: The work advances AI solvers for DEs, making them practical for broad applications in nature and engineering.

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FuseTen is a generative framework that fuses satellite data to produce daily Land Surface Temperature (LST) at 10m resolution, outperforming linear methods by 32.06% in metrics and 31.42% visually.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation require accurate LST data, but satellite trade-offs between spatial and temporal resolution limit availability.

Method: FuseTen combines Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS data using a generative architecture with attention, normalization, and PatchGAN for realism.

Result: FuseTen improves quantitative metrics by 32.06% and visual fidelity by 31.42% over linear baselines.

Conclusion: FuseTen is the first non-linear method to achieve daily LST at 10m resolution, addressing critical gaps in land surface monitoring.

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

TL;DR: The BAR Theorem framework addresses the trade-off between inference-time budget, factual authenticity, and reasoning capacity in LLM services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners need to balance inference-time budget, factual authenticity, and reasoning capacity in LLM services, but no model optimizes all three.

Method: Formal proof of the trade-off and proposal of the BAR Theorem framework.

Result: Demonstrates the inherent trade-off and provides a principled design framework.

Conclusion: The BAR Theorem offers a structured approach to LLM-application design despite the trade-offs.

Abstract: When designing LLM services, practitioners care about three key properties:
inference-time budget, factual authenticity, and reasoning capacity. However,
our analysis shows that no model can simultaneously optimize for all three. We
formally prove this trade-off and propose a principled framework named The BAR
Theorem for LLM-application design.

*Peter Sharpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NaN-propagation detects sparsity in black-box functions by exploiting IEEE 754 NaN values, eliminating false negatives and improving gradient optimization speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing finite-difference methods for sparsity detection produce false negatives due to coincidental zero gradients, leading to corrupted gradient calculations.

Method: Systematically contaminates inputs with NaN to trace dependencies, reconstructing conservative sparsity patterns without modifying black-box codes.

Result: Achieves a 1.52x speedup on an aerospace model, detecting dependencies missed by conventional methods.

Conclusion: NaN-propagation is a robust, language-agnostic method for accurate sparsity detection, enhancing gradient-based optimization workflows.

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

TL;DR: DocsRay is a training-free system for understanding multimodal documents using pseudo-TOC generation and hierarchical RAG, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in understanding complex multimodal documents due to structural inconsistencies and limited training data.

Method: Combines pseudo-TOC generation, zero-shot multimodal analysis, and hierarchical retrieval to process diverse document elements without training.

Result: Reduced query latency by 45% and achieved 64.7% accuracy on MMLongBench-Doc, surpassing previous benchmarks.

Conclusion: DocsRay effectively processes multimodal documents without training, offering significant efficiency and accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: A method using a generator-agnostic observer model detects AI hallucinations via a linear probe on residual streams, outperforming baselines and showing robust performance across model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of contextual hallucinations in AI by identifying and mitigating unsupported statements.

Method: Uses a linear probe on the residual stream of an observer model to isolate a transferable direction separating hallucinated from faithful text, with localization via gradient-times-activation.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 5-27 points, shows robust mid-layer performance, and causally steers hallucination rates.

Conclusion: Demonstrates low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to MLP sub-circuits, offering actionable insights for detection and mitigation.

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

### [50] [Efficient Machine Unlearning via Influence Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23257)
*Jiawei Liu,Chenwang Wu,Defu Lian,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU), an efficient machine unlearning method inspired by cognitive science, linking memorizing (incremental learning) to forgetting (unlearning).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing privacy concerns necessitate machine unlearning, but existing methods like influence-based unlearning are computationally expensive due to Hessian matrix calculations.

Method: The paper proposes IAU, leveraging the connection between incremental learning and unlearning for efficiency, avoiding costly Hessian computations.

Result: IAU achieves a superior balance of removal guarantee, efficiency, and model utility, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: IAU offers a practical solution for efficient machine unlearning, validated across diverse datasets and models.

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic framework to analyze privacy leakage in deep learning, focusing on how training factors influence sample-level vulnerabilities and revealing early-stage determination of privacy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how deep learning models encode membership information during training, addressing gaps in current knowledge about privacy leakage dynamics.

Method: A dynamic analytical framework tracks per-sample vulnerabilities on an FPR-TPR plane during training, examining factors like dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice.

Result: Findings show a strong correlation between a sample's learning difficulty and its privacy risk, with highly vulnerable samples' risks determined early in training.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of dynamic privacy risk emergence, supporting proactive, privacy-aware training strategies.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural network layer API for sequence modeling, enabling both layer-by-layer and step-by-step execution, with explicit state representation and strong correctness guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the creation of streamable and correct sequence models, addressing bugs in streaming and parallel processing.

Method: Layers define explicit state over time and a step method for state evolution, ensuring identical results to stateless layer-wise invocation.

Result: Enables immediate streaming, bug mitigation, and composable model construction with correctness guarantees.

Conclusion: SequenceLayers provides a practical solution for building production-scale sequence models with ease and reliability.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task of predicting forgotten items in supermarket visits, proposing two interpretable algorithms that outperform existing methods by 10-15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NBP approaches lack focus on detecting unintentionally omitted items and rely on opaque models, limiting transparency and user trust.

Method: Two interpretable-by-design algorithms are proposed to identify forgotten items with clear explanations.

Result: The algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP baselines by 10-15% on a real-world retail dataset.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses the gap in forgotten item prediction, offering transparent and effective solutions.

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly inform high-stakes decisions
across sectors, transparency has become foundational to responsible and
trustworthy AI implementation. Leveraging our role as a leading institute in
advancing AI research and enabling industry adoption, we present key insights
and lessons learned from practical interpretability applications across diverse

*Tao He,Rongchuan Mu,Lizi Liao,Yixin Cao,Ming Liu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces process reward models (PRMs) and TP-GRPO, a novel RL algorithm, to improve training efficiency for large reasoning models (LRMs) in math tasks by providing structured, thought-level rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RL approaches for LRMs rely on sparse outcome-only rewards, leading to inefficient optimization. The study aims to address this by leveraging intrinsic signals for stepwise correctness and dynamic reward balancing.

Method: The proposed method uses intrinsic signals to evaluate stepwise correctness, aggregates steps into coherent 'thought' units, and dynamically balances exploration-exploitation. This is integrated into TP-GRPO, an off-policy RL algorithm.

Result: Experiments on 1.5B and 7B parameter LRMs show higher accuracy with fewer training samples compared to outcome-only reward baselines.

Conclusion: Structured process rewards significantly accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning, validated by improved efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

*Georg Slamanig,Francesco Corti,Olga Saukh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEFT methods are benchmarked on convolutional architectures for edge devices, showing varied efficiency compared to LLMs and traditional fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and evaluate PEFT methods for smaller models on edge devices, where computational efficiency is critical.

Method: Benchmarked LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore on convolutional architectures using PyTorch profilers to compare performance and computational costs.

Result: PEFT methods are less memory-efficient for depthwise-separable convolutions but can reduce FLOPs by up to 95% for edge-optimized architectures.

Conclusion: PEFT methods' efficiency varies by architecture, providing guidance for selecting methods based on hardware and performance needs.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CostCert is a scalable and precise certified recovery defender for deep learning systems, outperforming PatchGuard by avoiding pairwise comparisons and combinatorial explosion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for patch robustness certification fail to precisely certify the true label within top-k predictions due to vote inflation and combinatorial issues.

Method: CostCert verifies the true label by checking if the attack budget is insufficient to exclude it from top-k predictions, avoiding pairwise comparisons.

Result: CostCert retains up to 57.3% certified accuracy for large patch sizes, while PatchGuard drops to zero.

Conclusion: CostCert offers a more effective and scalable solution for certified recovery in adversarial patch defense.

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method using pre-trained language models and attention mechanisms predicts clinical trial patient enrollment more accurately than baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate patient enrollment prediction is critical for clinical trial success but challenging due to complexities in clinical documents and uncertainties.

Method: Proposes a neural network model combining PLMs for document representation, tabular features via attention, and a Gamma-based probabilistic layer for uncertainty.

Result: Outperforms baseline models in predicting patient enrollment across sites, validated on real-world clinical trial data.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses enrollment prediction challenges, enhancing clinical trial planning.

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

TL;DR: L-GTA is a transformer-based generative model for time series augmentation, improving data reliability and predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data augmentation is crucial for time series tasks, but existing methods lack control and reliability.

Method: Uses a transformer-based variational recurrent autoencoder to apply controlled latent-space transformations.

Result: Produces more reliable and controllable augmented data, enhancing predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: L-GTA outperforms direct transformation methods in generating high-quality synthetic time series.

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and explaining concept drift is essential to prevent model failures and physical system malfunctions.

Method: The work extends model-based drift explanations to causal explanations and evaluates the framework on practical use cases.

Result: The framework successfully isolates causally relevant features affected by concept drift, enabling targeted interventions.

Conclusion: Causal explanations enhance the actionability of drift explanations, making them more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage points over FLGuard under non-IID conditions and robust performance against diverse attacks.

Conclusion: OptiGradTrust and FedBN-Prox provide a secure and efficient solution for FL, addressing both Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity, with validated improvements in real-world datasets.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed medical institutions while preserving patient privacy, but remains
vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity. We present
OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data
heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch
Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLARE introduces a novel offline RL method using vision-language models (VLMs) to bypass manual reward design, achieving competitive performance in robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL avoids costly online data collection, but existing methods rely on manually designed rewards, which are labor-intensive. PLARE addresses this by using VLMs for preference-based guidance.

Method: PLARE queries VLMs for preference labels on visual trajectory segments based on task descriptions, training policies directly with a contrastive learning objective, avoiding explicit reward models.

Result: PLARE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art VLM-based reward methods in MetaWorld tasks and shows effectiveness in real-world robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: PLARE offers a practical, scalable solution for offline RL by eliminating manual reward design, validated in both simulated and real-world settings.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

*Mokhtar A. Al-Awadhi,Ratnadeep R. Deshmukh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML-based system detects honey adulteration using mineral profiles, with random forest achieving 98.37% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address honey adulteration by leveraging ML and mineral element profiles for detection.

Method: Two-phase system: preprocessing (missing-value treatment, normalization) and classification (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest).

Result: Random forest outperforms others with 98.37% accuracy; mineral content is discriminative.

Conclusion: ML, especially random forest, effectively detects honey adulteration using mineral profiles.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based system for detecting
honey adulteration utilizing honey mineral element profiles. The proposed
system comprises two phases: preprocessing and classification. The
preprocessing phase involves the treatment of missing-value attributes and
normalization. In the classifica-tion phase, we use three supervised ML models:
logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, to dis-criminate between
authentic and adulterated honey. To evaluate the performance of the ML models,
we use a public dataset comprising measurements of mineral element content of
authentic honey, sugar syrups, and adul-terated honey. Experimental findings
show that mineral element content in honey provides robust discriminative
information for detecting honey adulteration. Results also demonstrate that the
random forest-based classifier outperforms other classifiers on this dataset,
achieving the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.37%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CODA is a method for active model selection that reduces annotation effort by prioritizing data points that differentiate the best candidate model, outperforming existing methods by up to 70%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model selection requires costly validation datasets; CODA aims to minimize annotation effort by leveraging predictions from candidate models.

Method: CODA uses a probabilistic framework to model relationships between classifiers, categories, and data points, guiding label acquisition via consensus and disagreement between models.

Result: CODA reduces annotation effort by over 70% compared to prior methods, validated on 26 benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: CODA efficiently identifies the best model with minimal labeling, offering a scalable solution for model selection.

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of adulteration in coconut milk, ensuring product authenticity and safety.

Method: Three-phase system: preprocessing (data cleaning), feature extraction (LDA), and classification (KNN).

Result: Achieved 93.33% cross-validation accuracy in detecting adulteration.

Conclusion: The proposed system is effective for identifying adulterated coconut milk using infrared spectroscopy and machine learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a system for detecting adulteration in coconut
milk, utilizing infrared spectroscopy. The machine learning-based proposed
system comprises three phases: preprocessing, feature extraction, and
classification. The first phase involves removing irrelevant data from coconut
milk spectral signals. In the second phase, we employ the Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) algorithm for extracting the most discriminating features. In
the third phase, we use the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model to classify coconut
milk samples into authentic or adulterated. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed system using a public dataset comprising Fourier Transform Infrared
(FTIR) spectral information of pure and contaminated coconut milk samples.
Findings show that the proposed method successfully detects adulteration with a
cross-validation accuracy of 93.33%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning solution operators for time-dependent PDEs efficiently and effectively.

Method: Introduces a factorization of spatial and temporal dimensions using structured state-space models, enabling parameter efficiency and long-range dynamics modeling.

Result: Outperforms alternatives on PDE benchmarks, uses fewer parameters, and shows improved performance under partial observability.

Conclusion: ST-SSM offers efficient, generalizable PDE modeling with strong theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

TL;DR: Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework, uses Sparse Gaussian Process and multi-objective Bayesian optimization to efficiently co-optimize neural network performance and hardware energy efficiency, reducing computational costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The extensive search space and high computational cost of HW-NAS limit its practical adoption, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: Coflex integrates Sparse Gaussian Process with multi-objective Bayesian optimization, reducing kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear using sparse inducing points.

Result: Coflex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and Energy-Delay-Product, achieving computational speed-ups of 1.9x to 9.5x.

Conclusion: Coflex offers a scalable and efficient solution for HW-NAS, balancing performance and computational overhead.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from
1.9x to 9.5x.

TL;DR: The paper generalizes the large-margin ℓp-SVDD method with manifold regularization and signature kernels for time series anomaly detection, improving performance by capturing data geometry and complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance anomaly detection in time series by leveraging data distribution geometry and structural information through manifold regularization and signature kernels.

Method: A manifold-regularized ℓp-SVDD variant is formulated, optimized using a Representer theorem, and employs signature kernels to handle time series complexities.

Result: Theoretical analysis via Rademacher complexities and experimental validation show improved detection performance compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines manifold regularization and signature kernels for superior time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: We generalise the recently introduced large-margin $\ell_p$-SVDD approach to
exploit the geometry of data distribution via manifold regularising and a
signature kernel representation for time series anomaly detection.
Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD
method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture
structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an
existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation
technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the
signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection.
  We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to
analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental
assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its
performance against other methods.

Motivation: Accurate mortality risk estimation in T2DM patients is essential for personalized treatment.

Method: Analyzed 554 T2DM patients over 16.8 years, identified key features, and trained ML models, with SHAP for interpretability.

Result: The EST model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776 and high AUC values (0.86-0.826) for mortality prediction.

Conclusion: The model is clinically interpretable and effective for identifying high-risk T2DM patients, aiding treatment optimization.

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines when structural uncertainty in causal inference is significant enough to require Bayesian model averaging, identifying key conditions for its benefit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners often ignore structural uncertainty in causal inference, potentially leading to flawed decisions. This paper addresses when such uncertainty matters.

Method: The study focuses on bivariate relationships, using Bayesian model averaging over competing causal structures. It identifies conditions under which this method is beneficial.

Result: Model averaging is beneficial when structural uncertainty is moderate to high, causal effects vary between structures, and loss functions are sensitive to effect size. Optimality results are proven under regularity conditions.

Conclusion: The framework addresses a typically overlooked source of uncertainty, complementing robust causal inference methods.

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEA is a dynamic ensemble aggregation method for Q-value estimates in actor-critic frameworks, adapting conservatism and exploration based on data-driven directional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static ensemble aggregation rules in off-policy RL are inflexible and discard useful information, limiting adaptability to task needs or training phases.

Method: DEA introduces learnable directional parameters for critic-side conservatism and actor-side exploration, trained using ensemble disagreement-weighted Bellman errors.

Result: DEA outperforms static ensemble strategies across continuous control benchmarks and various learning regimes.

Conclusion: DEA provides a flexible, adaptive solution for Q-value aggregation, improving performance in continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between certificate length and verifier runtime, and how this impacts complexity theory and problem-solving.

Method: Proves a Verifier Trade-off Theorem, showing the minimum certificate length required for reduced verification time, and applies it to complexity classes and natural problems.

Result: Establishes a hierarchy based on certificate complexity and provides insights into conjectured separations between complexity classes and problems like string periodicity.

Conclusion: The theorem offers a framework for analyzing complexity trade-offs and sheds light on the P vs. NP problem through sub-linear certificates.

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides the first high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level, showing improved convergence rates under heavy-tailed noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses require increasing clipping thresholds, conflicting with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian mechanism. This work bridges the gap by analyzing fixed clipping levels.

Method: The study analyzes DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level for convex and non-convex smooth optimization under heavy-tailed noise (bounded central α-th moment).

Result: The method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution faster than prior work, balancing convergence speed and privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: Fixed clipping levels in DP-Clipped-SGD offer a refined trade-off between convergence and privacy, advancing practical DP implementations.

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel continual learning method, Experience Blending, uses synthetic boundary data (SBD) and stored key samples to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, outperforming baselines by 10-13% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by improving decision boundary stability with synthetic data.

Method: Proposes Experience Blending: (1) DP noise for SBD generation, (2) joint training with stored samples and SBD.

Result: Outperforms 9 baselines on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet with accuracy gains of 10%, 6%, and 13%.

Conclusion: Experience Blending effectively mitigates forgetting by leveraging synthetic boundary data and stored samples.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a subquadratic-time algorithm for computing matrix-vector products with asymmetric Gaussian Kernel matrices, validated by experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for fast processing of attention matrices, particularly in applications like LLMs, drives the study of efficient algorithms for matrix-vector products with Gaussian Kernel matrices.

Method: The algorithm leverages a modelling assumption that the sum of matrix entries scales linearly in n, enabling subquadratic-time computation for unrestricted vectors.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves the first subquadratic-time solution under the given assumption, with experimental validation.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical and efficient solution for fast attention computation, validated in real-world settings.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power
consumption and low-latency inference on neuromorphic hardware for a wide range
of robotic tasks. In this work, we present an energy-efficient implementation
of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using quantized SNNs to solve two
classical control tasks. The network is trained using the Q-learning algorithm,
then fine-tuned and quantized to low-bit (8-bit) precision for embedded
deployment on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic chip. To evaluate the comparative
advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze
inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for
our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our
results demonstrate SpiNNaker2's strong potential for scalable, low-energy
neuromorphic computing, achieving up to 32x reduction in energy consumption.
Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements
observed in certain task settings, reinforcing SpiNNaker2's viability for
real-time neuromorphic control and making the neuromorphic approach a
compelling direction for efficient deep Q-learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

TL;DR: GraphRAG-R1 enhances multi-hop reasoning in LLMs using adaptive reinforcement learning, addressing retrieval and over-thinking issues with novel rewards and hybrid retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GraphRAG methods struggle with multi-hop reasoning due to heuristic-based retrieval and underutilized LLM reasoning potential.

Method: Proposes GraphRAG-R1 with process-constrained RL (modified GRPO), PRA and CAF rewards, phase-dependent training, and hybrid graph-textual retrieval.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, with flexible integration into existing retrieval methods.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1 effectively boosts LLM reasoning for complex problems, offering adaptable and scalable improvements.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

Result: EB-gMCR achieved high accuracy (R^2 >= 0.98) on noisy synthetic datasets with up to 256 sources, recovering component counts within 5% of ground truth.

Conclusion: EB-gMCR combines generative modeling and component selection, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for large-scale signal unmixing.

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

### [80] [Hierarchical Message-Passing Policies for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23604)
*Tommaso Marzi,Cesare Alippi,Andrea Cini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel method combining hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and message-passing for decentralized MARL to address partial observability and non-stationarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in decentralized MARL like partial observability and non-stationarity by integrating coordination and temporal abstraction.

Method: Uses feudal HRL and hierarchical graph structure for planning. Lower-level agents follow upper-level goals and exchange messages. Novel reward-assignment method trains lower-level policies.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The combination of HRL and message-passing is effective for scalable multi-agent policies.

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

### [81] [On the Expressiveness of Softmax Attention: A Recurrent Neural Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23632)
*Gabriel Mongaras,Eric C. Larson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains why softmax attention outperforms linear attention by analyzing it as an RNN, revealing the importance of its components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why softmax attention, despite its quadratic complexity, is more expressive than linear attention methods.

Method: Derives softmax attention's recurrent form, treating it as an RNN to analyze its components and their interactions.

Result: Identifies the expressive power of softmax attention by dissecting its RNN-like structure.

Conclusion: Softmax attention's components, when analyzed as an RNN, explain its superior performance over linear attention.

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

TL;DR: A SHAP-guided regularization framework is proposed to improve model performance and interpretability by incorporating feature importance constraints during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance predictive performance and interpretability of machine learning models by leveraging SHAP feature attributions for optimization.

Method: Introduces entropy-based penalties to encourage sparse, stable feature attributions, applicable to regression and classification tasks, starting with TreeSHAP for tree-based models.

Result: Improves generalization performance and ensures robust, interpretable feature attributions in benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework provides an explainability-driven regularization approach, making models more accurate and reliable.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and
more reliable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TweakLLM introduces a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses, improving cache effectiveness without compromising response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient response caching in LLMs is challenging due to personalized interactions and limited semantic similarity accuracy.

Method: TweakLLM uses a lightweight LLM to dynamically tweak cached responses for incoming prompts.

Result: TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness.

Conclusion: TweakLLM is a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

*Tianyi Chen,Haitong Ma,Na Li,Kai Wang,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FPMD enables 1-step sampling in RL, improving responsiveness without extra training, matching diffusion policy performance with fewer evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion policies in RL are expressive but slow due to iterative sampling. FPMD aims to address this limitation.

Method: FPMD leverages flow matching models for 1-step sampling, using flow policy and MeanFlow policy variants.

Result: FPMD matches diffusion policy performance on MuJoCo benchmarks with significantly fewer function evaluations.

Conclusion: FPMD offers a faster, efficient alternative to diffusion policies in online RL without compromising performance.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

*Rabeya Tus Sadia,Qiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DepMicroDiff, a diffusion-based framework with Dependency-Aware Transformer, outperforms existing methods in microbiome data imputation by leveraging metadata and capturing microbial dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microbiome data's sparsity and noise hinder accurate imputation, limiting downstream tasks like biomarker discovery. Existing methods miss microbial interdependencies and contextual metadata.

Method: Combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT), enhanced by VAE pretraining and metadata conditioning via an LLM.

Result: Achieves higher Pearson correlation (0.712), cosine similarity (0.812), and lower RMSE/MAE on TCGA datasets, showing robustness across cancer types.

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff is a robust, generalizable solution for microbiome imputation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

*Aymane Abdali,Bartosz Boguslawski,Lucas Drumetz,Vincent Gripon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using anomalous samples in few-shot settings for binary anomaly classification, proposing a multi-score method and augmentation-based validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalous data is often scarce, but even a few samples can be valuable. The study questions the reliance on normal samples and investigates leveraging anomalies for better classification.

Method: Proposes a multi-score anomaly detection method combining Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques, with augmentation-based validation for score optimization.

Result: Demonstrates the effectiveness of anomalous samples in training and validates the proposed method on industrial datasets.

Conclusion: Anomalous samples can significantly improve anomaly classification, especially in few-shot settings, with the proposed method showing promise.

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

### [87] [Improving annotator selection in Active Learning using a mood and fatigue-aware Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23756)
*Diana Mortagua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS) for Active Learning (AL) that selects annotators based on past accuracy, mood, and fatigue levels to reduce annotation errors and improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in AL strategies by considering internal human factors (mood, fatigue) that influence annotator performance, which are often overlooked in existing methods.

Method: The paper introduces an RS that ranks annotators using past accuracy, mood, and fatigue levels, along with query instance information, to optimize query-annotator pairs.

Result: The proposed approach reduces annotation errors and model uncertainty, with improved accuracy and F1-scores compared to methods ignoring internal factors.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of human cognitive factors in AL and demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating them into annotator selection strategies.

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

TL;DR: The paper integrates causal learning with reinforcement learning to improve autonomous vehicle decision-making in complex traffic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research struggles with seamless interaction in multi-vehicle environments, prompting the need for better decision-making methods.

Method: Combines causal disentanglement representation learning (CDRL) with graph neural network-based reinforcement learning to extract and use causal features.

Result: The method achieves the highest average reward during training and outperforms others in metrics like collision rate and cumulative reward.

Conclusion: The approach advances multi-agent autonomous driving, making navigation safer and more efficient in complex environments.

Abstract: Since the advent of autonomous driving technology, it has experienced
remarkable progress over the last decade. However, most existing research still
struggles to address the challenges posed by environments where multiple
vehicles have to interact seamlessly. This study aims to integrate causal
learning with reinforcement learning-based methods by leveraging causal
disentanglement representation learning (CDRL) to identify and extract causal
features that influence optimal decision-making in autonomous vehicles. These
features are then incorporated into graph neural network-based reinforcement
learning algorithms to enhance decision-making in complex traffic scenarios. By
using causal features as inputs, the proposed approach enables the optimization
of vehicle behavior at an unsignalized intersection. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the highest average reward during
training and our approach significantly outperforms other learning-based
methods in several key metrics such as collision rate and average cumulative
reward during testing. This study provides a promising direction for advancing
multi-agent autonomous driving systems and make autonomous vehicles' navigation
safer and more efficient in complex traffic environments.

TL;DR: Agent-based simulations using the capability approach (CA) assess policy impacts on human well-being, demonstrated in a case study on health inequity among Barcelona's homeless population.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate social policies non-invasively and address human development challenges by modeling agent behavior and measuring inequity.

Method: Integrates CA into a reinforcement learning environment where agents restore capabilities under policy constraints, validated via stakeholder collaboration.

Result: First proof-of-concept simulation aligning with CA to assess policy impacts, applied to health inequity in Barcelona's homeless population.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of CA-aligned simulations for policy evaluation, offering actionable insights for human development.

Abstract: Agent-based simulations have an enormous potential as tools to evaluate
social policies in a non-invasive way, before these are implemented to
real-world populations. However, the recommendations that these computational
approaches may offer to tackle urgent human development challenges can vary
substantially depending on how we model agents' (people) behaviour and the
criteria that we use to measure inequity. In this paper, we integrate the
conceptual framework of the capability approach (CA), which is explicitly
designed to promote and assess human well-being, to guide the simulation and
evaluate the effectiveness of policies. We define a reinforcement learning
environment where agents behave to restore their capabilities under the
constraints of a specific policy. Working in collaboration with local
stakeholders, non-profits and domain experts, we apply our model in a case
study to mitigate health inequity among the population experiencing
homelessness (PEH) in Barcelona. By doing so, we present the first proof of
concept simulation, aligned with the CA for human development, to assess the
impact of policies under parliamentary discussion.
