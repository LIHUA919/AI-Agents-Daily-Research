Existing approaches typically follow either a fully centralized or a fully decentralized design. Fully centralized approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and reliance on a single learning server, whereas purely decentralized approaches operate under severe partial observability and lack explicit coordination resulting in suboptimal performance. These limitations motivate region-based MARL, where the network is partitioned into smaller, tightly coupled intersections that form regions, and training is organized around these regions. This paper introduces a Semi-Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (SEMI-CTDE) architecture for multi intersection ATSC. Within each region, SEMI-CTDE performs centralized training with regional parameter sharing and employs composite state and reward formulations that jointly encode local and regional information. The architecture is highly transferable across different policy backbones and state-reward instantiations. Building on this architecture, we implement two models with distinct design objectives. A multi-perspective experimental analysis of the two implemented SEMI-CTDE-based models covering ablations of the architecture's core elements including rule based and fully decentralized baselines shows that they achieve consistently superior performance and remain effective across a wide range of traffic densities and distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "A semi-centralized training, decentralized execution architecture for multi-agent reinforcement learning in traffic signal control that partitions intersections into regions for better coordination.", "motivation": "Existing fully centralized approaches suffer from dimensionality issues and single-point failures, while fully decentralized approaches lack coordination and operate under partial observability.", "method": "SEMI-CTDE architecture with regional partitioning, centralized training within regions, parameter sharing, and composite state/reward formulations combining local and regional information.", "result": "Two implemented models consistently outperform rule-based and fully decentralized baselines across various traffic conditions and densities.", "conclusion": "The SEMI-CTDE architecture provides an effective balance between coordination and scalability, demonstrating superior performance and transferability across different policy backbones."}}

Where $\u03b5$-machines capture the predictive temporal structure and intrinsic computation of ABM-generated time series, diffusion models characterize high-dimensional cross-sectional distributions, learn underlying data manifolds, and enable synthetic generation of plausible population-level outcomes. We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that the two approaches operate on distinct mathematical domains -- processes vs. distributions -- and show that their combination yields a two-axis representation of ABM behavior based on temporal organization and distributional geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to integrate computational mechanics with score-based generative modeling for the structural analysis of ABM outputs, thereby situating ABM characterization within the broader landscape of modern machine-learning methods for density estimation and intrinsic computation. The framework is validated using the same elder-caregiver ABM dataset introduced in the companion paper, and we provide precise definitions and propositions formalizing the mathematical complementarity between $\u03b5$-machines and diffusion models.

This paper puts forward a groundbreaking new framework that is the first to capture the real-world economic forces that shape agentic labor markets: adverse selection, moral hazard, and reputation dynamics. Our framework encapsulates three core capabilities that successful LLM-agents will need: \\textbf{metacognition} (accurate self-assessment of skills), \\textbf{competitive awareness} (modeling rivals and market dynamics), and \\textbf{long-horizon strategic planning}. We illustrate our framework through a tractable simulated gig economy where agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt their strategies under competitive pressure. Our simulations illustrate how LLM agents explicitly prompted with reasoning capabilities learn to strategically self-improve and demonstrate superior adaptability to changing market conditions. At the market level, our simulations reproduce classic macroeconomic phenomena found in human labor markets, while controlled experiments reveal potential AI-driven economic trends, such as rapid monopolization and systemic price deflation. This work provides a foundation to further explore the economic properties of AI-driven labour markets, and a conceptual framework to study the strategic reasoning capabilities in agents competing in the emerging economy.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a novel framework analyzing AI agent behavior in economic markets, focusing on adverse selection, moral hazard, and reputation dynamics through LLM agent simulations in a gig economy.", "motivation": "Understanding AI agents' strategic behavior and market impact is critical as they deploy across economic domains, requiring frameworks that capture real-world economic forces.", "method": "Developed a tractable simulated gig economy where LLM agents compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt strategies, using agents prompted with reasoning capabilities to study metacognition, competitive awareness, and strategic planning.", "result": "Simulations show LLM agents learn strategic self-improvement and adaptability, reproducing classic macroeconomic phenomena and revealing AI-driven trends like rapid monopolization and price deflation.", "conclusion": "The work establishes a foundation for exploring AI-driven labor market economics and a conceptual framework for studying strategic reasoning in agents within emerging economies."}}
