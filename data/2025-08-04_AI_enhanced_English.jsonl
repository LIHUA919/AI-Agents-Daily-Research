Building on these insights, we propose a\nDGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e.,\nevolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal\nego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively\nupdated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new\ndomain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with\ndynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies. Finally,\nDP-DGAD employs confidence-based pseudo-labeling for effective self-supervised\nadaptation in target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance across ten real-world datasets from different\ndomains.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes DP-DGAD, a dynamic graph anomaly detection model using dynamic prototypes to capture evolving domain-specific and domain-agnostic patterns, achieving state-of-the-art results.", "motivation": "Generalist GAD models struggle with dynamic graphs and lack labeled data, necessitating a method to capture evolving anomalies across domains.", "method": "DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes from temporal ego-graphs, updates a memory buffer selectively, and uses an anomaly scorer with confidence-based pseudo-labeling.", "result": "The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten real-world datasets.", "conclusion": "DP-DGAD effectively addresses cross-domain dynamic graph anomaly detection by capturing evolving patterns and adapting self-supervised."}}
