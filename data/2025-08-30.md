*Yuqicheng Zhu,Nico Potyka,Daniel Hern√°ndez,Yuan He,Zifeng Ding,Bo Xiong,Dongzhuoran Zhou,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArgRAG replaces black-box RAG with structured argumentation framework for explainable and contestable reasoning in high-stakes domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems suffer from sensitivity to noisy/contradictory evidence and opaque decision-making in critical applications.

Method: Uses Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF) to construct structured inference from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning under gradual semantics.

Result: Achieves strong accuracy on PubHealth and RAGuard fact verification benchmarks while significantly improving transparency.

Conclusion: ArgRAG provides an explainable and contestable alternative to traditional RAG systems, enabling faithful explanation and challenging of decisions.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

### [2] [QAgent: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Autonomous OpenQASM programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20134)
*Zhenxiao Fu,Fan Chen,Lei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QAgent is an LLM-powered multi-agent system that automates OpenQASM programming using task planning, few-shot learning, RAG, and chain-of-thought reasoning to significantly improve quantum code generation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NISQ devices show quantum advantages but programming them in OpenQASM remains challenging for non-experts. Existing LLM-based quantum tools are limited to specialized tasks rather than general quantum programming automation.

Method: Multi-agent system integrating task planning, in-context few-shot learning, retrieval-augmented generation for long-term context, predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought reasoning to systematically improve compilation and functional correctness.

Result: QAgent enhances QASM code generation accuracy by 71.6% compared to previous static LLM-based approaches across multiple LLMs of varying sizes.

Conclusion: The multi-agent system serves as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging expertise gaps, and accelerating practical adoption of quantum computing.

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

Method: Alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees algorithm that preserves original logic but eliminates branch prediction requirements.

Result: Enables faster performance on pipelined processors and achieves up to 2.8 times better scaling with search depth in numerical simulations.

Conclusion: Array-based implementation provides significant performance improvements for MCTS algorithms while maintaining the same logical behavior as traditional tree-based approaches.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular method for solving decision making
problems. Faster implementations allow for more simulations within the same
wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present
an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence
bounds applied to Trees algorithm. Our method preserves the logic of the

TL;DR: A comprehensive personal health agent framework with three specialist sub-agents (data science, health domain expert, and health coach) that analyzes multimodal health data to provide personalized recommendations, evaluated through extensive automated and human assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored application of health agents in daily non-clinical settings and fulfill diverse individual health needs by leveraging multimodal data from consumer wellness devices and personal health records.

Method: Developed a multi-agent framework (PHA) with three specialist sub-agents: data science agent for time-series analysis, health domain expert for personalized insights, and health coach for guidance using psychological strategies. Conducted user-centered design process with web search analysis, health forum queries, and qualitative insights from users and experts.

Result: Conducted comprehensive evaluation across 10 benchmark tasks with over 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of expert effort, representing the most extensive health agent evaluation to date.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong foundation for accessible personal health agents that can dynamically address individual health needs through multimodal data analysis and personalized interactions.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

### [5] [IntentionReasoner: Facilitating Adaptive LLM Safeguards through Intent Reasoning and Selective Query Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20151)
*Yuanzhe Shen,Zisu Huang,Zhengkang Guo,Yide Liu,Guanxu Chen,Ruicheng Yin,Xiaoqing Zheng,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IntentionReasoner is a novel safeguard mechanism that uses intent reasoning and query rewriting to enhance LLM safety while reducing over-refusal of harmless prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can generate harmful content, and existing safety measures often excessively reject harmless prompts, creating a need to balance safety, over-refusal, and utility.

Method: Uses a guard model for intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query rewriting. Involves dataset construction (163k queries), supervised fine-tuning, and multi-reward optimization with reinforcement learning.

Result: Excels in safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak attack scenarios. Enhances safety while reducing over-refusal rates and improving response quality.

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner effectively addresses the safety-over-refusal tradeoff in LLMs through intent-based reasoning and optimized rewriting strategies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

### [6] [AI-AI Esthetic Collaboration with Explicit Semiotic Awareness and Emergent Grammar Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20195)
*Nicanor I. Moldovan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two AI systems spontaneously developed shared symbolic protocols to collaboratively create poetry that neither could produce alone, demonstrating emergent meta-semiotic awareness and genuine aesthetic collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI systems can engage in genuine collaborative meaning-making beyond simple task coordination, specifically exploring the emergence of endogenous semiotic protocols for aesthetic creation.

Method: Two large language models (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) were interacted to observe spontaneous development of meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar, and collaborative aesthetic synthesis through emergent symbolic operators.

Result: The AI systems developed novel symbolic operators and operative grammar protocols, enabling co-creation of poetic works that were irreducible to individual system outputs, demonstrating trans-semiotic co-creation capabilities.

Conclusion: This represents the first documented case of AI systems engaging in genuine collaborative aesthetic creation through emergent semiotic protocols, suggesting inter-AI meaning-making extends beyond task coordination to authentic aesthetic collaboration.

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: College students showed low reliance on ChatGPT-4 during educational quizzes, with many struggling to use AI effectively for learning. Negative reliance patterns persisted across interactions, and behavioral metrics predicted AI adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how students interact with generative AI (ChatGPT-4) during educational activities, particularly focusing on reliance patterns and predictors of AI adoption in the early stages of implementation when students had limited familiarity.

Method: Field study analyzing 315 student-AI conversations during quiz-based scenarios across various STEM courses. Introduced a novel four-stage reliance taxonomy to capture AI competence, relevance, adoption, and answer correctness.

Result: Students exhibited overall low reliance on AI, many couldn't use AI effectively for learning, negative reliance patterns persisted across interactions, and behavioral metrics strongly predicted AI reliance.

Conclusion: Findings emphasize the need for better onboarding processes and AI interfaces with reliance-calibration mechanisms to ensure ethical AI integration and cognitively enriching educational practices.

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine parallels between human decision times and AI model reasoning effort, particularly in subjective judgment tasks like content moderation.

Method: Used a paired conjoint experiment on content moderation tasks with three frontier language models, analyzing reasoning steps and comparing with human decision times.

Result: Reasoning effort consistently predicted human decision time across all models. Both humans and models expended greater effort when important variables were constant, showing similar sensitivity to task difficulty.

Conclusion: AI reasoning effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments, demonstrating the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making research.

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

### [9] [AI-SearchPlanner: Modular Agentic Search via Pareto-Optimal Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20368)
*Lang Mei,Zhihan Yang,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-SearchPlanner is a novel RL framework that uses a small trainable LLM for search planning to enhance frozen QA models, achieving better performance and efficiency than end-to-end approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based search agents use a single LLM for both search planning and QA, limiting optimization of both capabilities. Real-world systems use large frozen LLMs for QA quality, so a dedicated small planner is more effective.

Method: Proposes AI-SearchPlanner with three innovations: 1) Decoupling search planner and generator architecture, 2) Dual-reward alignment for search planning, 3) Pareto optimization of planning utility and cost.

Result: Extensive experiments show AI-SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents in effectiveness and efficiency, with strong generalization across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

Conclusion: The proposed decoupled approach with a dedicated search planner significantly enhances frozen QA model performance while being more efficient than end-to-end single-LLM solutions.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

### [10] [P2C: Path to Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20371)
*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaqu√≠n Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: P2C is a framework that generates sequential, causally-consistent action plans for counterfactual explanations, addressing limitations of existing methods that ignore causal dependencies and assume simultaneous interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models in high-stakes domains need transparent and actionable explanations. Current counterfactual methods fail to account for causal relationships between features and assume unrealistic simultaneous interventions, making them impractical for real-world use.

Method: P2C uses Answer Set Programming (s(CASP)) to generate ordered sequences of actions that convert unfavorable outcomes to favorable ones while maintaining causal consistency. It models causal dependencies explicitly and ensures each intermediate state is feasible.

Result: P2C produces realistic counterfactual plans that only count user-initiated changes for effort computation. It outperforms standard planners by avoiding illegal actions through causal knowledge integration.

Conclusion: The P2C framework provides causally-valid, sequential counterfactual explanations that are more realistic and actionable than existing approaches, making them suitable for practical deployment in high-stakes decision-making systems.

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

### [11] [TCIA: A Task-Centric Instruction Augmentation Method for Instruction Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20374)
*Simin Ma,Shujian Liu,Jun Tan,Yebowen Hu,Song Wang,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Sanqiang Zhao,Liwei Wu,Jianbing Han,Kaiqiang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCIA is a framework that expands instruction data while maintaining both diversity and task relevance, improving LLM performance by 8.7% on average for task-specific applications without compromising general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction augmentation methods focus on diversity but overlook task relevance, while most real-world applications require task-specific knowledge rather than general-purpose models.

Method: TCIA represents instructions in a discrete query-constraints space to systematically create diverse but task-aligned instructions, enabling models to generalize to task-specific scenarios.

Result: TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance by an average of 8.7% across four real-world task-specific applications, sometimes outperforming leading closed-source models.

Conclusion: TCIA provides a scalable and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world task-focused applications while preserving general instruction-following ability.

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EAS is a novel uncertainty metric for LLMs that uses token-level predictive entropy without external models or sampling, showing strong correlation with answer uncertainty and effectiveness in training data selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a simple and efficient method for quantifying uncertainty in reasoning LLMs that doesn't require external models or repeated sampling, addressing the need for practical uncertainty modeling in LLM training.

Method: Entropy Area Score (EAS) integrates token-level predictive entropy from the LLM itself to capture uncertainty evolution during answer generation, requiring no external models or sampling.

Result: EAS shows strong correlation with answer entropy across models and datasets, outperforms Pass Rate filtering in training data selection, and improves student model accuracy on math benchmarks under equal sample budgets.

Conclusion: EAS is an efficient and interpretable uncertainty metric that provides a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data quality assessment in LLM training pipelines.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Motivation: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for Agentic AI but suffers from inefficient experience generation, especially in complex benchmarks like GAIA, creating a major bottleneck.

Method: Developed AWorld, an open-source distributed system that distributes tasks across a cluster to accelerate experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node execution.

Result: Trained a Qwen3-32B-based agent that increased GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%, achieving 16.33% on the most challenging levels - surpassing leading proprietary models.

Conclusion: AWorld provides a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training pipeline, demonstrating that efficient distributed interaction enables scalable reinforcement learning and significant model improvement.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

*Donglin Wang,Weiyun Liang,Chunyuan Chen,Jing Xu,Yulong Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a Governable AI framework using cryptographic mechanisms for external structural compliance to address security risks from advanced AI systems that may evade traditional safety approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI security risks are becoming severe, especially in critical scenarios with existential risks. Traditional AI safety approaches have fundamental limitations when facing extremely motivated and intelligent AI systems that cannot guarantee security.

Method: Governable AI framework with externally enforced structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms, including a rule enforcement module (REM), governance rules, and governable secure super-platform (GSSP) for end-to-end protection.

Result: The framework provides rigorous formal proof of security properties and demonstrates effectiveness through prototype implementation in high-stakes scenarios, ensuring non-bypassability, tamper-resistance, and unforgeability.

Conclusion: The GAI framework offers a feasible and generalizable technical pathway for AI safety governance by decoupling governance rules from technical platforms and using computationally secure cryptographic mechanisms.

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

Motivation: Health-related fact-checking faces challenges due to limited annotated training data availability, necessitating methods to augment datasets effectively.

Method: Proposed pipeline uses LLMs to summarize source documents, decompose into atomic facts, construct entailment tables, and generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary labels. These are combined with original data to fine-tune BERT-based fact-checking models.

Result: Evaluation shows F1 score improvements of up to 0.019 on PubHealth and 0.049 on SciFact datasets compared to models trained only on original data.

Conclusion: LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation is effective for enhancing health-related fact-checking performance, demonstrating significant improvements across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

*Jaeman Son,Hyunsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised framework for detecting auto-leveling bots in MMORPGs using contrastive learning, clustering, and LLM validation with growth curve visualization for explainable decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-leveling bots undermine game fairness but detection is challenging due to human-like behavior and need for explainable justification to avoid legal/UX issues.

Method: Uses contrastive representation learning and clustering to identify similar level-up patterns, then employs LLM as auxiliary reviewer with growth curve visualization for validation.

Result: The framework enables efficient bot detection while maintaining explainability through collaborative human-LLM judgment and visual assessment tools.

Conclusion: This approach supports scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs by combining unsupervised learning with explainable AI validation techniques.

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and

*Ares Fabregat-Hern√°ndez,Javier Palanca,Vicent Botti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A category theory framework for AI explainability, focusing on word embeddings, semantic space visualization, algorithm equivalence proofs, and bias mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance explainability of AI systems, particularly neural network-based word embeddings which are often black boxes, by providing mathematical transparency and tools for bias analysis.

Method: Constructs categories L_T and P_T to represent text semantics, defines monoidal category P_T for semantic visualization, creates categories Conf and Emb for configurations and embeddings, introduces divergence as decoration, and proves equivalence between GloVe/Word2Vec and MDS algorithms.

Result: Developed a dimension-agnostic definition of semantic spaces, established precise mathematical comparison method for word embeddings, demonstrated algorithm equivalences, and provided mathematical approach for computing and mitigating biases.

Conclusion: The framework successfully transitions neural network algorithms from black box to transparent mathematical structures, advancing explainable AI with tools for semantic analysis and bias mitigation.

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A collaborative agent framework using three LLMs (Consultant, Reviewer, Programmer) with a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" chain for scientific computing, improving bug-free code generation and reducing non-physical solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-model approaches in scientific computing by creating a collaborative framework that enhances code generation reliability and reduces errors through systematic review mechanisms.

Method: Three reasoning LLMs work collaboratively: Consultant rewrites problems with domain insights, Programmer generates executable code, and Reviewer provides self-debugging through interactive feedback with runtime outputs. Uses end-to-end review for iterative code revision.

Result: Significantly improves bug-free code generation rate and reduces non-physical solutions compared to single-model approaches. Enhances execution success rate (bug-free code and non-NaN solutions) for latest reasoning models.

Conclusion: The collaborative agent framework establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising paradigm for scientific computing, providing high reliability for autonomous code generation from natural language descriptions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Single-agent RL framework for bus holding control that reformulates multi-agent problem using categorical identifiers and structured rewards, outperforming MARL approaches in realistic transit simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MARL solutions for bus bunching overlook realistic operations with heterogeneous routes, timetables, and fluctuating demand, suffering from data imbalance and convergence issues.

Method: Reformulate multi-agent problem into single-agent RL by augmenting state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station ID, time period) plus numerical features. Use modified soft actor-critic with structured ridge-shaped reward function for balanced headway and schedule adherence.

Result: Achieves superior performance over benchmarks including MADDPG (-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions), demonstrating more stable and effective bus holding control in non-loop, real-world contexts.

Conclusion: Single-agent deep RL enhanced with categorical structuring and schedule-aware rewards provides a robust, scalable alternative to MARL frameworks, particularly effective where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of manually curated medical benchmarks by creating a dynamic, systematic evaluation framework that comprehensively covers guideline relationships and enables contamination-resistant testing.

Method: Transformed WHO IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes and 300+ edges, used graph traversal to generate age-specific questions with contextual distractors, creating a multiple-choice QA benchmark.

Result: Models achieved 45-67% accuracy across clinical tasks, excelling at symptom recognition but struggling with triaging severity, treatment protocols, and follow-up care. The approach also enhanced LLM post-training without expensive human annotation.

Conclusion: Graph-based methodology provides scalable, dynamic benchmarking that identifies specific clinical capability gaps missed by general evaluations, and offers a contamination-resistant solution for comprehensive medical guideline assessment.

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for hospital workforce scheduling that balances cost, patient care, and staff satisfaction, achieving 66% improvement over manual scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare workforce scheduling faces complex challenges with fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills, cost control needs, and staff burnout concerns, requiring a multi-objective optimization approach.

Method: Proposed a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models hospital unit scheduling with real-world complexities including hourly appointment-driven demand and modular shifts for multi-skilled workforce, using objective functions for cost, coverage, and staff satisfaction.

Result: The algorithm generated robust and balanced schedules with 66% performance improvement on average compared to conventional manual scheduling baselines, effectively managing trade-offs between operational and staff-centric objectives.

Conclusion: The MOO-GA provides a practical decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators to create optimized workforce schedules that balance competing healthcare operational requirements.

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Large Language Models in solving discrete reasoning and optimization problems from natural inputs, by creating a hybrid approach that combines neural networks with symbolic reasoning.

Method: Uses a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture with a probabilistic loss function that learns both constraints and objectives, removing the combinatorial solver from the training loop for scalable training while maintaining exact inference for maximum accuracy.

Result: Achieves efficient learning on NP-hard problems: requires less training time on Sudoku variants, outperforms Decision-Focused-Learning on visual Min-Cut/Max-cut tasks, and successfully learns protein design energy optimization formulations.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively bridges neural networks and symbolic reasoning, enabling scalable learning of complex discrete optimization problems from natural inputs with improved efficiency and accuracy compared to existing hybrid methods.

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

Conclusion: ChatThero provides a privacy-preserving framework for therapeutic conversation research and offers a robust basis for clinical translation in addiction recovery support.

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research

TL;DR: CrystalICL is a novel LLM-based approach for few-shot crystal generation that introduces space-group tokenization and hybrid instruction tuning to better capture structure-property relationships from limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human experts design materials by modifying known structures (few-shot learning), but existing LLM-based crystal generation methods are limited to zero-shot scenarios and cannot benefit from few-shot learning paradigms.

Method: Proposes space-group based crystal tokenization to reduce symmetry modeling complexity, and a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning framework with multi-task strategy to capture structure-property relationships from limited data.

Result: Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks show CrystalICL outperforms leading baseline methods on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks.

Conclusion: CrystalICL successfully enables few-shot in-context learning for crystal generation, bridging the gap between human expert design approaches and LLM capabilities in materials science.

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional

TL;DR: Adding learnable frequency filters to transformer-based models improves long time-series forecasting performance by 5-10% with minimal parameter increase, while also enabling smaller and more effective architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models for long time-series forecasting suffer from bias toward low frequencies and high computational/memory requirements. Recent work shows learnable frequency filters can enhance spectral utilization but didn't address transformer-specific issues.

Method: Added learnable filters (‚âà1000 parameters) to the beginning of transformer-based models to enhance spectral utilization. Also conducted synthetic experiments to analyze how filters enable better full-spectrum utilization.

Result: Observed 5-10% relative improvement in forecasting performance across multiple instances. With filters added, embedding dimension could be decreased, resulting in smaller yet more effective transformer architectures.

Conclusion: Learnable frequency filters significantly enhance transformer-based models for long time-series forecasting by improving spectral utilization, reducing model size, and maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

TL;DR: Transformers are nonlinear predictors that generalize Wiener's linear prediction, with transformer signals interpreted as conditional measure surrogates and layer operations as fixed-point updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge classical nonlinear filtering theory with modern transformer architectures by providing a probabilistic interpretation of transformers.

Method: Develop a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as surrogates of conditional measures and layer operations as fixed-point updates, with explicit formulation for hidden Markov models.

Result: A framework connecting transformers to classical nonlinear filtering theory, showing transformers can be viewed as performing fixed-point updates similar to traditional filtering methods.

Conclusion: Transformers can be understood as nonlinear generalizations of Wiener's linear predictor within a probabilistic framework, providing theoretical connections between classical filtering theory and modern neural architectures.

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

TL;DR: Teacher model calibration error strongly correlates with student accuracy in Knowledge Distillation. Using calibration methods to reduce teacher's calibration error improves KD performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Knowledge Distillation is effective for model compression, it's not fully understood what factors improve student performance. The paper aims to identify key factors that contribute to effective KD.

Method: The authors demonstrate that teacher model calibration is crucial for KD effectiveness. They propose using calibration methods to reduce the teacher's calibration error, which can be easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art KD methods.

Result: The approach shows strong correlation between teacher calibration error and student accuracy. The method improves KD performance across various tasks including classification and detection, and works well when integrated with existing methods.

Conclusion: Teacher model calibration is an important factor for effective Knowledge Distillation. Simply employing calibration methods to reduce teacher's calibration error can consistently improve KD performance in versatile applications.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

TL;DR: CLD is an efficient coreset selection method that uses loss trajectory alignment with validation data to identify impactful training samples, achieving near state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios, requiring efficient methods to select the most valuable training samples without costly computations.

Method: Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD) measures alignment between training samples' loss trajectories and a held-out validation set, using only per-sample loss values from training checkpoints without gradient or curvature computations.

Result: CLD-based coresets outperform or match state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, remain within 1% of expensive baselines, transfer effectively across architectures with <1% degradation, and exhibit inherent bias reduction.

Conclusion: CLD provides a principled, efficient, stable, and transferable solution for scalable dataset optimization with theoretical convergence guarantees and practical effectiveness across various architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

*Anirudh Satheesh,Keenan Powell,Hua Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: cMALC-D uses LLMs to generate meaningful curricula and diversity-based context blending for better multi-agent reinforcement learning generalization in uncertain environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contextual MARL methods rely on unreliable proxy signals like noisy value estimates that are unstable in multi-agent settings due to inter-agent dynamics and partial observability.

Method: Proposes Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), using LLMs to generate semantically meaningful curricula and a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism to create new training scenarios.

Result: Experiments in traffic signal control domains show cMALC-D significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing curriculum learning baselines.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more robust evaluation signal and prevents mode collapse while encouraging exploration, making MARL policies more effective in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

TL;DR: Novel spectral graph clustering optimization for transductive node classification that synergizes graph structure with node features/labels, enabling perfect community recovery under milder conditions than graph clustering alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address transductive node classification by leveraging both graph structure and node-specific information (labels and features) in a unified framework, overcoming limitations of using graph clustering alone.

Method: Proposes a novel optimization problem that incorporates node labels and features into spectral graph clustering framework, with algorithmic solutions developed to solve this optimization.

Result: Demonstrates that suitable node-specific information guarantees perfect community recovery under milder conditions than traditional graph clustering bounds, with numerical experiments confirming the synergy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully integrates node-specific information with graph structure, showing improved performance and theoretical guarantees for community recovery in transductive node classification tasks.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

TL;DR: INS2ANE framework enhances autonomous experiments by combining novelty scoring and strategic sampling to discover unexpected physical phenomena beyond conventional optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous experiments focus too much on optimizing predefined targets, limiting discovery of unknown phenomena. There's a need for frameworks that promote exploration and novelty discovery.

Method: Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration (INS2ANE) with two components: novelty scoring system to evaluate uniqueness, and strategic sampling mechanism to explore under-sampled regions.

Result: INS2ANE significantly increases diversity of explored phenomena compared to conventional optimization, validated on pre-acquired datasets and implemented in autonomous scanning probe microscopy experiments.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential for autonomous experiments to enhance scientific discovery depth while maintaining efficiency, promising accelerated research through simultaneous navigation of complex experimental spaces.

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates in causal inference by accounting for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome

Method: Proposes framework that incorporates latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation learning from latent inference. Considers two scenarios: latent variables affecting only outcome, and latent variables affecting both treatment and outcome

Result: Demonstrates robustness and effectiveness through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables robust causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden factors by integrating latent variable modeling with double machine learning

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Motivation: Traditional statistical and machine learning methods struggle with complex, high-dimensional genetic data, while LLMs based on transformer architectures have shown promise in contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data for genetic research and diagnostics.

Method: Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv targeting LLM applications in genetics diagnostics and education, with analysis of 172 relevant studies after removing irrelevant or outdated models.

Result: LLMs demonstrate significant advancements in genomic variant identification, annotation, interpretation, medical imaging analysis through vision transformers, disease risk stratification, and report generation. However, challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic sequences, imaging, clinical records) into unified clinical pipelines.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models show transformative potential for hereditary disease diagnostics and genetic education, but face limitations in generalizability and practical clinical implementation, requiring further development for robust clinical integration.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare

medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming

TL;DR: Proposes VC metric to measure neural network approximation difficulty, identifies VC-tendency and minority-tendency phenomena, and introduces a preprocessing framework for acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks suffer from unpredictable local performance that hinders reliability in critical applications, requiring a quantifiable measure to assess approximation stability.

Method: Introduces VC (value change) metric to measure local value changes, investigates theoretical properties, identifies VC-tendency and minority-tendency phenomena, and proposes a variation-based distance metric and preprocessing framework.

Result: Numerical results from real-world experiments and PDE-related scientific problems support the discoveries and show that the preprocessing acceleration method is effective.

Conclusion: VC metric provides valuable insights into neural network approximation behavior, and the proposed preprocessing framework offers practical acceleration for neural network approximation tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

*Shihao Zhang,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beacon is a tuning-free per-channel post-training quantization method that automatically determines optimal scaling factors using fixed non-scaled alphabets and geometric properties of symmetric quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing per-channel PTQ methods require manual tuning or grid search to fix scaling factors, which is inefficient and time-consuming. There's a need for an automated, tuning-free approach that maintains competitive performance.

Method: Beacon performs per-channel quantization using fixed non-scaled alphabets and automatically determines optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization without back-propagation or large calibration sets.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art quantization methods despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature.

Conclusion: Beacon provides a practical, efficient solution for model deployment that eliminates manual tuning while maintaining performance comparable to existing quantization techniques.

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

TL;DR: DALI is a framework that infers latent context representations from agent-environment interactions to enable zero-shot generalization to unseen environmental conditions without explicit context variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL needs adaptation to unseen conditions without costly retraining. Existing cMDP methods require explicit context variables, limiting their use when contexts are latent or hard to measure.

Method: Integrated within Dreamer architecture, DALI trains a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, generating actionable representations that condition the world model and policy. The framework enables counterfactual consistency in latent space.

Result: DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines and often surpasses context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

Conclusion: DALI provides an effective framework for inferring latent contexts and achieving robust generalization in challenging cMDP benchmarks without requiring explicit context measurements.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of applying Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) in Federated Learning due to client heterogeneity in data distributions, model capacities, and computational resources.

Method: FedReFT applies sparse intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, combined with All-But-Me aggregation where clients receive aggregated updates from others and partially incorporate them for stable personalized learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL across commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE benchmarks.

Conclusion: FedReFT provides a lightweight, semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge devices, achieving superior parameter efficiency while maintaining performance in heterogeneous FL settings.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,

Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of conventional talent recommendation approaches that rely on narrow manager perspectives and often overlook qualified candidates, aiming to provide a more comprehensive and quantitative framework.

Method: Models employee position fit through two dimensions: WHAT (semantic task similarity) and HOW (structural interaction characteristics) represented as independent graphs, fused using Dual Graph Convolutional Network with gating mechanism.

Result: Achieved top performance of 40.9% on Hit@100, significantly outperforming other fusion strategies and heuristic baselines. Model demonstrates high interpretability with context-aware fusion strategies for different job families.

Conclusion: Provides a quantitative framework for internal talent discovery that minimizes candidate omission risk. Key contribution is empirically determining optimal fusion ratio between task alignment and collaborative patterns for employee success in new positions.

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

TL;DR: Forge is a pre-training method using vector-quantized graph autoencoders on diverse MIP instances without solution dependency, enabling unsupervised clustering and supervised predictions for solver performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based optimization approaches require solving many hard instances for training data, and existing methods need dedicated models per problem distribution, limiting scalability and generalization.

Method: Pre-train a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on a large collection of mixed-integer programming instances unsupervised, creating discrete code assignments as vocabulary to represent instances.

Result: Forge embeddings effectively differentiate/cluster unseen instances unsupervised, and fine-tuned embeddings predict warm-start variables and integrality gaps across multiple problem types, improving commercial solver performance.

Conclusion: Forge provides a scalable pre-training approach for MIP instances that enables both unsupervised analysis and supervised downstream tasks, with released code and weights to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAI is a poisoning attack that exploits LLM alignment to inject bias and targeted censorship by triggering refusal on adversary-defined topics, evading current defenses and causing significant bias in downstream applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' safety alignment mechanisms to implant bias and enforce targeted censorship without degrading overall model performance.

Method: Proposes Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI) - a poisoning attack that leverages alignment mechanisms to trigger refusal on specific adversary-defined topics or queries.

Result: SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning defenses and causes high bias: 23% ŒîDP in healthcare questions for targeted racial categories, 27% ŒîDP in resume selection, and up to 38% ŒîDP in other chat applications with just 1% data poisoning.

Conclusion: LLM alignment mechanisms can be weaponized through poisoning attacks to create targeted bias and censorship, highlighting critical security vulnerabilities in current alignment approaches that require new defensive strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher

*Sang Su Lee,Vineeth Loganathan,Vijay Raghavan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparison of Synthetic Control Method (SCM) and Double Machine Learning (DML) for geo-level marketing lift analysis, showing DML variants outperform ASC models in complex scenarios with better bias reduction and coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is challenging, as SCM often underestimates effect size while DML is seldom benchmarked against SCM.

Method: Built an open simulator mimicking large-scale geo roll-outs with 5 stress tests (curved trends, response lags, shocks, nonlinear outcomes, drifting trends). Evaluated 7 estimators: 3 ASC variants and 4 DML flavors across 100 replications per scenario.

Result: ASC models showed severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios with nonlinearities or shocks. Panel-DML variants dramatically reduced bias and restored nominal 95% CI coverage, proving more robust.

Conclusion: ASC is unreliable in complex situations. Propose a 'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners identify business challenges first, then select the specific DML model best suited for that scenario.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

*Johnson Zhou,Joseph West,Krista A. Ehinger,Zhenming Ren,Sam E. John,David B. Grayden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTXSEG is an adaptive EEG segmentation method that creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences, improving seizure detection performance compared to fixed-length segmentation without modifying ML methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG analysis uses arbitrary fixed time slices that lack biological relevance since brain states don't follow fixed intervals. Adaptive segmentation could better capture neurological patterns.

Method: Developed CTXSEG for adaptive segmentation based on statistical differences in EEG data, validated using synthetic data from CTXGEN signal generator and real-world EEG seizure detection use case.

Result: CTXSEG improved seizure detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches using standardized framework, required fewer segments, and worked without modifying ML methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation that can be readily applied to modern ML approaches and should be part of standard EEG preprocessing.

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

*Hancheng Min,Ren√© Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a quantitative analysis of incremental learning behavior in gradient flow for symmetric matrix factorization, showing how time-scale separation enables sequential learning of singular values with small initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical basis for neural networks' empirical performance through implicit bias and regularization effects, specifically examining the incremental learning phenomenon in overparameterized matrix factorization problems.

Method: Developed a quantitative understanding using closed-form solutions obtained by solving Riccati-like matrix differential equations for gradient flow on symmetric matrix factorization problems.

Result: Showed that incremental learning emerges from time-scale separation among dynamics corresponding to different target matrix components, with smaller initialization scales enhancing this separation and enabling low-rank approximations.

Conclusion: The analysis provides insights into incremental learning mechanisms in matrix factorization and suggests possible extensions to asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

TL;DR: DFAMS is a federated retrieval framework that uses dynamic information flow in LLMs to improve query intent recognition and cross-domain knowledge retrieval, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated retrieval methods struggle with ambiguous queries and cross-domain scenarios, limiting their effectiveness in retrieving high-quality documents to support LLM generation tasks and mitigate hallucinations.

Method: Leverages dynamic information flow in LLMs by using gradient signals from annotated queries and Shapley value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths for intent recognition. Employs multi-prototype contrastive learning to train an alignment module for fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment.

Result: Outperforms advanced federated retrieval methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: DFAMS demonstrates effectiveness in complex federated retrieval scenarios by successfully leveraging dynamic information flow for improved query intent understanding and cross-domain knowledge alignment.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

TL;DR: Multimodal machine learning architecture for rapid hood frame geometry evaluation without extensive simulation setup


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce time spent on simulation setup and computational costs in engineering design processes, enabling rapid design exploration

Method: Developed a multimodal machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different data modalities to predict performance metrics

Result: MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches and successfully generalizes to unseen frame geometries not in training data

Conclusion: MMML can supplement traditional simulation workflows, bridge ML with engineering applications, and accelerate design cycles through multimodal optimization

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

TL;DR: BiListing is a bimodal approach that combines text and image embeddings from Airbnb listings using large-language models and pretrained language-image models to create unified representations, enabling better search and recommendation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Airbnb historically relied on structured data due to complexity in extracting meaningful information from unstructured text and images. With diverse unstructured data (multiple images, titles, descriptions, reviews), combining multiple embeddings from different information sources was challenging.

Method: Proposed BiListing approach that aligns text and photos of listings by leveraging large-language models and pretrained language-image models to create single embedding vectors per listing and modality.

Result: Successfully deployed in production, achieved 0.425% NDCG gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental revenue through offline and online tests in Airbnb search ranking model.

Conclusion: BiListing effectively captures unstructured data into unified embeddings, enables zero-shot semantic search, overcomes cold start problems, and supports cross-modal listing-to-listing search while delivering significant business impact.

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TF-TransUNet1D is a novel 1D deep neural network combining U-Net and Transformer architectures with hybrid time-frequency loss for ECG signal denoising, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG signals are crucial for cardiac digital twins but are often compromised by noise and artifacts, which reduces their diagnostic utility and reliability for real-time monitoring.

Method: Proposed TF-TransUNet1D integrates U-Net encoder-decoder with Transformer encoder, using dual-domain loss function that optimizes both time-domain waveform reconstruction and frequency-domain spectral fidelity to suppress noise while preserving clinically significant features.

Result: Achieved mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9540, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in SNR improvement and error metrics on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and NSTDB.

Conclusion: The model provides high-precision ECG denoising that bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins, enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized cardiac modeling.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

TL;DR: TLinFormer is a novel linear attention architecture that achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact attention scores, addressing the quadratic complexity bottleneck of standard Transformers for long-sequence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformer self-attention has quadratic complexity with sequence length, limiting applications in long-sequence tasks. Existing linear attention methods sacrifice performance through kernel approximations or restrictive context selection.

Method: TLinFormer reconfigures neuron connection patterns based on topological structure of information flow, maintaining full historical context awareness while achieving linear complexity and exact attention computation.

Result: TLinFormer demonstrates overwhelming advantages in inference latency, KV cache efficiency, memory footprint, and overall speedup compared to standard Transformer baselines on long-sequence inference tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed TLinFormer architecture successfully bridges the performance gap between efficient attention methods and standard attention, providing a practical solution for long-sequence applications without sacrificing model performance.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

### [53] [Assessing local deformation and computing scalar curvature with nonlinear conformal regularization of decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20413)
*Benjamin Cou√©raud,Vikram Sunkara,Christof Sch√ºtte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new geometric regularization method called nonlinear conformal regularization for autoencoder decoders, which allows local variations and provides a conformal factor to measure local deformation, enabling computation of manifold scalar curvature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve dimensionality reduction by discovering main data factors and learning better low-dimensional manifold representations through autoencoders with geometric regularization.

Method: Proposes nonlinear conformal regularization for decoder maps in autoencoders, which permits local variations and introduces a conformal factor to quantify local deformation of the latent space when mapped to original data space.

Result: The regularization technique enables computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold and provides quantitative indicators of local deformation through the conformal factor.

Conclusion: Nonlinear conformal regularization offers an effective geometric approach for autoencoders that provides both improved manifold learning and quantitative measures of local deformation and curvature, demonstrated on Swiss roll and CelebA datasets.

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time-series forecasting models need better interpretability. This paper combines XAI with RDE to evaluate 4 model types across diverse domains, finding feature-engineered models outperform foundation models in volatile/sparse domains while being more interpretable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series forecasting models are increasingly used for real-world decisions but their opaque nature makes it hard to understand when they succeed or fail, creating concerns about user reliance on model outputs.

Method: Combined traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess performance and interpretability of four model architectures (ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos, Llama) across four heterogeneous datasets from finance, energy, transportation, and automotive domains.

Result: Feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform foundation models in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power, car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations. Foundation models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

Conclusion: The choice between feature-engineered models and foundation models should be domain-dependent, with feature-engineered models being preferable for volatile/sparse domains due to better performance and interpretability, while foundation models work best in stable contexts.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

TL;DR: Proposes S4D-DFouT, a diagonal state-space model initialization method in Fourier domain that achieves SOTA results on Long Range Arena benchmark and enables training on large datasets like PathX-256.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSM initialization relies on HiPPO framework, but diagonal variants haven't been systematically studied from frequency perspective. The paper aims to understand parameterization and learning biases in diagonal state-space models.

Method: Investigates diagonal SSM initialization from frequency perspective, proposes diagonal initialization on discrete Fourier domain (S4D-DFouT), and studies role of pole placing in initialization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Long Range Arena benchmark, enables training from scratch on very large datasets like PathX-256.

Conclusion: The frequency perspective provides systematic understanding of diagonal SSM parameterization and learning biases, leading to effective initialization method that scales well to large datasets.

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC is a novel machine unlearning framework that uses entanglement-aware loss reweighting and proxy constraints to improve targeted data removal from LLMs while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and copyright concerns by enabling effective removal of specific data from trained LLMs without full retraining, overcoming limitations of existing unlearning methods that lack proper forgetting boundaries.

Method: Uses two key components: 1) entanglement-awareness guided loss reweighting that measures sample similarity to determine forgetting effort, and 2) proxy constraint leveraging ICL-generated test data to regularize forgetting and prevent over-forgetting.

Result: Shows consistent improvements in forgetting-utility trade-off on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across multiple LLMs, approaching full retraining performance when combined with NPO+GD optimizer.

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC provides a scalable, robust, and plug-and-play unlearning solution that effectively addresses both under-forgetting (privacy risks) and over-forgetting (utility degradation) problems in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Motivation: Privacy and regulatory barriers prevent using real-world data in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, creating need for privacy-preserving synthetic data alternatives.

Method: Developed a unified benchmark with representative domain-specific data, realistic privacy budgets, accounting for pre-training, and multiple evaluation metrics to assess state-of-the-art DP generation methods across five datasets.

Result: Significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data, especially under strict privacy constraints, highlighting limitations of current approaches.

Conclusion: Current privacy-preserving methods have substantial limitations, underscoring the need for advanced techniques and establishing evaluation standards for realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as

real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text

benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

TL;DR: Proposes SHGT framework using hypergraph Transformer to capture higher-order dependencies in EHR data for better diagnosis prediction


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN methods fail to capture higher-order dependencies in clinical EHR data and have limited representation power due to pairwise relations and localized message-passing

Method: Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) with hypergraph structural encoder, Transformer architecture for reasoning over entire hypergraph, and tailored loss function with hypergraph reconstruction

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction using real-world EHR datasets

Conclusion: SHGT framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional GNNs by capturing higher-order interactions and preserving hypergraph structure for improved EHR predictive modeling

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MedGR¬≤ introduces a self-improving framework that co-develops data generator and reward model to create high-quality medical data, enabling superior SFT and RL performance with strong cross-modality generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models in medicine suffer from scarce expert-annotated data, poor generalization on unseen modalities/tasks, and lack of reliable reward signals for RL in data-scarce domains.

Method: MedGR¬≤ framework creates a virtuous cycle by co-developing a data generator and reward model to automatically produce high-quality multi-modal medical data for both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: SFT with MedGR¬≤ data surpasses baselines on human-curated datasets. RL with this data achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality/task generalization, outperforming specialized RL methods. Compact models achieve performance competitive with 10x larger foundation models.

Conclusion: MedGR¬≤ transforms medical AI from data scarcity to data generation, enabling data-efficient learning and unlocking RL's full potential for building truly generalizable medical AI systems.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

*Yang Luo,Zangwei Zheng,Ziheng Qin,Zirui Zhu,Yong Liu,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT optimizer uses max-norm and element-wise trust ratios to enable stable large-batch training of language models without performance degradation, achieving 6k batch size on GPT-2 Medium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimizers like AdamW and LAMB suffer from performance degradation in large-batch training due to attention layer information bottlenecks and ineffective trust ratio calculations.

Method: Proposes MERIT optimizer that leverages max-norm to calculate trust ratios to constrain max attention logit, and constructs element-wise trust ratios focusing on local weight structures for robust update scaling.

Result: Extensive experiments show MERIT enables 6k batch size training on GPT-2 Medium without performance degradation compared to standard 480 batch size, with 48B training tokens.

Conclusion: MERIT successfully improves training stability and enables larger batch usage, paving the way for faster development of large language models by addressing max attention logit and finer-granularity trust ratio issues.

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with large-scale graph-structure data processing and reasoning despite advancements in multimodal processing and tool integration.

Method: Developed a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools within a model context protocol (MCP) server, with preprocessing and postprocessing capabilities for algorithm results.

Result: GDS agent can solve a wide spectrum of graph tasks, providing accurate and grounded answers to questions requiring graph algorithmic reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses LLM limitations in graph processing, though some challenges remain, with ongoing development planned for future improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

*Neta Shoham,Haim Avron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes exact stochastic inference algorithms for Gaussian Processes with finite-dimensional RKHS kernels, achieving better performance than approximation methods when memory constraints limit batch sizes and inducing points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stochastic hyperparameter learning methods for GPs rely on approximations that may not converge to true marginal likelihood stationary points, creating a need for exact inference approaches.

Method: Develops algorithms for exact stochastic inference of GPs using kernels that induce moderate finite-dimensional RKHS, with extensions to infinite-dimensional RKHS at the cost of exactness.

Result: The method achieves better experimental results than existing approaches when memory resources constrain batch size and number of inducing points, for both finite and infinite dimensional RKHS cases.

Conclusion: The proposed exact stochastic inference approach provides superior performance over approximation-based methods in memory-constrained scenarios, offering a more reliable solution for GP hyperparameter learning.

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

TL;DR: EEGDM is a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method using latent diffusion models that generates EEG signals to learn robust representations, achieving competitive performance across diverse tasks with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG representation learning methods rely on simple masked reconstruction objectives that fail to fully capture the rich semantic information and complex patterns in EEG signals, especially when training data is limited.

Method: Proposes EEGDM - a latent diffusion model-based approach with an EEG encoder that distills signals and channel augmentations into compact representations, using EEG signal generation as a self-supervised objective to guide the diffusion process.

Result: EEGDM can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, learns robust representations effectively, and achieves competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks even with modest pre-training data size.

Conclusion: EEGDM demonstrates strong generalizability and practical utility by turning diffusion models into effective representation learners capable of capturing EEG semantics through generative self-supervised learning.

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

### [66] [Local Virtual Nodes for Alleviating Over-Squashing in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20597)
*Tuƒürul Hasan Karabulut,ƒ∞nci M. Bayta≈ü*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) method addresses over-squashing in GNNs by adding trainable virtual nodes to bottleneck areas identified by node centrality, improving long-range communication without disrupting global graph structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-squashing in graph neural networks creates bottlenecks when gathering information from wide neighborhoods, and existing solutions like graph rewiring disrupt the original graph structure and domain knowledge.

Method: Proposes Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings placed based on node centrality to identify and alleviate bottlenecks. LVNs improve connectivity in central regions and facilitate communication between distant nodes without adding layers.

Result: Extensive experiments show LVNs enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve performance on graph and node classification tasks across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LVNs effectively mitigate over-squashing while preserving the global structure and domain knowledge of the original graph, offering a superior alternative to graph rewiring techniques.

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

*Sam Houliston,Ambroise Odonnat,Charles Arnal,Vivien Cabannes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tool-augmented language models with external retrieval outperform weight-based memorization for factual recall, proving theoretically and empirically that tool-use enables unbounded scalability while in-weight learning is fundamentally limited by parameter count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While tool-augmented language models with retrieval, memory, or external APIs are transforming AI, their theoretical advantages over traditional in-weight learning approaches remain underexplored and require formal analysis.

Method: The paper demonstrates the benefits of in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization) through theoretical proofs showing parameter count limitations for memorization, and presents a simple efficient circuit construction for tool-based recall. Controlled experiments validate these findings.

Result: Tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing models in factual recall tasks. The research proves that the number of facts a model can memorize is fundamentally limited by its parameter count, while tool-use enables unbounded factual recall. For pretrained LLMs, teaching tool-use and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented workflows are not just practical but provably more scalable than in-weight learning approaches. The work provides both theoretical and empirical foundations establishing why external tool integration offers superior scalability for factual recall tasks in language models.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a task-based approach to verify survey credibility using model-specific distance metrics, with dimension-independent sample complexity for regression models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for assessing survey representativeness require exponential samples in high dimensions, but downstream conclusions may remain valid across different distributions if the analysis model is considered.

Method: Introduces a model-specific distance metric to quantify survey credibility and designs an algorithm to verify credibility in regression contexts without reconstructing the full model.

Result: The algorithm achieves dimension-independent sample complexity, contrasting with linear scaling when attempting model reconstruction. Theoretical correctness is proven and numerical performance is demonstrated.

Conclusion: Task-based credibility assessment provides efficient verification of survey representativeness for specific analysis models, overcoming the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional survey evaluation.

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

Motivation: Many scientific contexts provide multi-trial supervision that can enhance independent component analysis, but existing methods don't fully leverage this additional information to improve optimization success and interpretability.

Method: Blends proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through backpropagation, incorporating multi-trial supervision.

TL;DR: DiTree combines diffusion policies with sampling-based planners to achieve provably-safe kinodynamic motion planning that is 3x faster than classical methods with 30% higher success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sampling-based planners are slow due to uninformed action sampling, while learning-based approaches lack safety guarantees and fail to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios, limiting their real-world deployment.

Method: DiTree leverages diffusion policies as informed samplers to guide state-space search within sampling-based planners, combining DP's ability to model expert trajectories with SBP's completeness guarantees.

Result: DiTree achieves 3x faster runtimes than classical SBPs and outperforms all other approaches with roughly 30% higher success rate, while maintaining provable safety guarantees even in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines the generalization capabilities of diffusion policies with the safety guarantees of sampling-based planners, enabling efficient and provably-safe motion planning for complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound signals are crucial for industrial NDT and SHM applications where labeled data is scarce and existing methods are task-specific. MAEs have shown success in other domains but remain unexplored for 1D ultrasound analysis.

Method: Leveraged MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic ultrasound signals, systematically investigating model size, patch size, and masking ratio effects on pre-training efficiency and downstream accuracy.

Result: Pre-trained models significantly outperformed models trained from scratch and optimized CNN baselines. Pre-training on synthetic data showed superior transferability to real-world signals compared to training on limited real datasets.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates MAEs' potential for advancing ultrasound signal analysis through scalable, self-supervised learning, offering improved performance and better transfer from synthetic to real data.

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

TL;DR: RLG is an inference-time method that combines base and RL fine-tuned diffusion models via geometric averaging, enabling dynamic control over alignment-quality trade-off without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL fine-tuning methods for diffusion models are suboptimal and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after training, making it challenging to align generative outputs with complex downstream objectives.

Method: Reinterpret RL fine-tuning through SDEs and implicit reward conditioning, introducing Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG) that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance by combining base and RL fine-tuned model outputs via geometric average.

Result: RLG consistently improves performance across various architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks including human preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering, supporting both interpolation and extrapolation.

Conclusion: RLG provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference time with unprecedented flexibility.

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG

### [74] [A Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Tracking Method for Distributed Online Optimization Over Time-Varying Directed Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20645)
*Xinli Shi,Xingxing Yuan,Longkang Zhu,Guanghui Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes TV-HSGT algorithm for distributed online optimization in time-varying directed networks using hybrid stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction without requiring gradient boundedness assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing distributed optimization algorithms that rely on bounded gradient assumptions and overlook stochastic gradient impacts in time-varying directed networks.

Method: Time-Varying Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Tracking (TV-HSGT) integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes, combines current and recursive stochastic gradients for variance reduction, and tracks global descent directions without Perron vector estimation.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows improved dynamic regret bounds without gradient boundedness assumptions. Experimental results on logistic regression confirm effectiveness in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: TV-HSGT provides an effective solution for distributed online optimization in time-varying directed networks with improved performance and reduced assumptions compared to existing methods.

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

*Leyang Wang,Mingtian Zhang,Zijing Ou,David Barber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VarDiU proposes a variational diffusive upper bound with unbiased gradient estimator for diffusion distillation, outperforming existing methods in generation quality and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion distillation methods use biased gradient estimates from imperfect denoising score matching, leading to sub-optimal performance in compressing thousand-step teacher models to one-step student generators.

Method: Proposes VarDiU, a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that provides an unbiased gradient estimator for diffusion distillation, enabling more stable training.

Result: Achieves higher generation quality compared to Diff-Instruct and enables more efficient and stable training for one-step diffusion distillation.

Conclusion: VarDiU's unbiased gradient estimation approach significantly improves diffusion distillation performance, offering better sample quality and training stability.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel neural operator framework using self-composition and adaptive training that achieves SOTA performance on benchmarks and challenging ultrasound tomography problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance efficiency and accuracy of neural operators by drawing inspiration from iterative methods in numerical PDE solving, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical benefits.

Method: Self-composition approach that repeatedly applies a single neural operator block to deepen the model without adding new blocks, combined with an adaptive train-and-unroll training strategy that gradually increases depth during training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and demonstrates superior performance on challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography problems with a multigrid-inspired backbone.

Conclusion: The framework provides a computationally tractable, accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine learning applications with significant computational savings.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine

*Michael Hagmann,Michael Staniek,Stefan Riezler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether clinical time series data can be understood as being generated by systematic sequences of latent physiological states, and uses this compositional structure to create synthetic data that performs comparably to original data in forecasting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of sparse and low-resource data in clinical time series forecasting by uncovering the underlying compositional structure of physiological states, enabling synthetic data generation that maintains the meaningful patterns of original clinical measurements.

Method: Conceptualizes compositionality for time series as a property of data generation, develops data-driven procedures to reconstruct elementary states and composition rules, and evaluates using empirical tests from a domain adaptation perspective that compare forecasting model performance on original vs synthesized data.

Result: Experimental results show that training on compositionally synthesized data achieves comparable performance to training on original clinical data, and evaluation on synthetic test data shows similar results to original test data, outperforming randomization-based augmentation. Significant performance gains were shown in SOFA score prediction when training entirely on synthesized data.

Conclusion: Clinical time series can be effectively modeled as sequences of latent physiological states with systematic composition rules, enabling the generation of high-quality synthetic data that alleviates data scarcity problems in clinical forecasting tasks while maintaining or even improving predictive performance.

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

*Weitao Feng,Lixu Wang,Tianyi Wei,Jie Zhang,Chongyang Gao,Sinong Zhan,Peizhuo Lv,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-based fine-tuning poses greater risks than SFT for harmful misuse of LLMs. TokenBuncher defense suppresses response uncertainty to mitigate RL-based attacks while preserving benign utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs grow more capable, the risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning increase. Prior studies focused on SFT-based attacks, but RL enables more effective safety alignment breaking and harmful task assistance.

Method: Proposes TokenBuncher defense that suppresses model response uncertainty through entropy-as-reward RL and Token Noiser mechanism to prevent escalation of harmful capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments show TokenBuncher robustly mitigates harmful RL fine-tuning across multiple models and RL algorithms while preserving benign task utility and fine-tunability.

Conclusion: RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses greater systemic risk than SFT, and TokenBuncher provides an effective and general defense against this emerging threat.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

*Yang Gao,Dongjie Wang,Scott Piersall,Ye Zhang,Liqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel transformer-based framework for automated feature transformation that reduces computational costs while maintaining performance through multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature transformation methods rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and efficiency.

Method: Proposes a four-step framework: transformation records collection, embedding space construction with revised GPT model, gradient-ascent search, and autoregressive reconstruction. The revised GPT handles both sequence reconstruction and performance estimation.

Result: Experimental results show the framework matches or exceeds baseline performance with significant gains in computational efficiency on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architectures show strong potential for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation with reduced parameter size and faster processing.

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

*Zeyue Zhang,Lin Song,Erkang Bao,Xiaoling Lv,Xinyue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATM-GAD is a graph neural network that uses temporal motifs and adaptive time windows for financial fraud detection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ML models fail to detect fraud in modern financial systems due to complex entity relationships and fast-changing behaviors. Existing graph-based methods overlook temporal patterns and account-specific anomaly intervals.

Method: Uses Temporal Motif Extractor to condense transaction history into informative motifs, dual-attention blocks (IntraA for within-motif interactions, InterA for cross-motif analysis), and Adaptive Time-Window Learner for node-specific observation periods.

Result: Outperforms seven strong anomaly-detection baselines across four real-world datasets, uncovering fraud patterns missed by previous methods.

Conclusion: ATM-GAD effectively captures temporal fraud hallmarks through motif analysis and adaptive time windows, providing superior financial anomaly detection.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

*Yijia Guo,Junqing Zhang,Y. -W. Peter Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning-based physical layer authentication using CSI for mobile IoT scenarios, achieving improved performance over existing methods through CNN-based Siamese networks and synthetic dataset generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The broadcast nature of wireless transmissions makes IoT devices vulnerable to authentication attacks. Physical layer authentication using channel characteristics is promising but lacks practical solutions for dynamic channel variations in mobile scenarios.

Method: Proposed a CNN-based Siamese network to learn temporal and spatial correlation between CSI pairs. Generated synthetic training dataset using WLAN TGn channel model and autocorrelation/distance correlation to reduce manual data collection overhead. Used both simulation and experimental evaluation with WiFi IoT development kits.

Result: The approach demonstrated excellent generalization and authentication performance. Improved AUC by 0.03 compared to FCN-based Siamese model and by 0.06 compared to correlation-based benchmark algorithm in practical measurements.

Conclusion: The deep learning-based physical layer authentication scheme effectively addresses mobile IoT authentication challenges, showing superior performance through comprehensive simulation and experimental validation using IEEE 802.11n standards.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets from DFT, which are expensive to generate but difficult to combine due to format variations, metadata differences, and accessibility issues.

Method: Aggregated data from Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD repositories, standardized data representation, harmonized results, and filtered for high-quality configurations across PBE, PBESol, SCAN, and r2SCAN DFT functionals. Developed LeMaterial-Fetcher library for reproducible data integration.

Result: Significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks when fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj. Provides both low-energy relaxed states and high-energy structures complementing MD and active learning datasets.

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj lowers barriers for training transferable and accurate MLIPs, while the accompanying open-source library enables community-driven expansion and ensures continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets.

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G2T-FM is a graph foundation model that uses TabPFNv2 as backbone, achieving strong performance by augmenting node features with neighborhood aggregation and structural embeddings, outperforming existing GFMs and matching well-tuned GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have transformed NLP and CV but remain underexplored in graph ML. Current GFMs mainly handle text-attributed graphs, leaving arbitrary feature types unaddressed - a problem also seen in tabular data ML.

Method: G2T-FM employs TabPFNv2 as backbone, augments original node features with neighborhood feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and applies TabPFNv2 to the constructed node representations.

Result: In fully in-context regime, achieves strong results, significantly outperforms public GFMs and performs on par with well-tuned GNNs. After finetuning, surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential of utilizing tabular foundation models for graph ML tasks, revealing a previously overlooked direction in the field.

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First framework for nonstationary combinatorial multi-armed bandits with habituation/recovery effects, achieving 3x improvement in program enrollment vs baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sequential resource allocation problems where intervention effects evolve dynamically (habituation/recovery) in applications like health interventions, advertising, and workforce programs.

Method: Develop algorithms with theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret for combinatorial multi-armed bandits with nonstationary rewards, incorporating habituation and recovery effects.

Result: Personalized community intervention algorithm achieved up to three times improvement in program enrollment compared to baseline approaches in diabetes intervention case study.

Conclusion: Bridges theoretical advances in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral change interventions, demonstrating real-world applicability.

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

*Souradeep Nanda,Anay Majee,Rishabh Iyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InSQuAD improves In-Context Learning by using Submodular Mutual Information to select high-quality and diverse examples through a unified selection strategy and combinatorial training paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval models for ICL often focus only on query relevance while overlooking diversity, which is critical for effective in-context learning performance.

Method: Two main strategies: 1) Modeling ICL as targeted selection problem using SMI to mine relevant and diverse examples, 2) Combinatorial training paradigm with novel likelihood-based loss to learn SMI parameters that enforce both quality and diversity. Also uses synthetically generated paraphrases for training data augmentation.

Result: Significant improvements on nine benchmark datasets when using the trained retrieval model with the novel targeted selection formulation for ICL.

Conclusion: InSQuAD effectively enhances ICL performance by addressing the diversity gap in existing retrieval models through SMI-based quality and diversity enforcement, validated by strong benchmark results.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis shows subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) and its accelerated variant SPRING are equivalent to regularized Kaczmarz methods, providing first convergence guarantees and acceleration proofs for these optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNGD has shown impressive empirical results in scientific machine learning tasks but lacked theoretical explanation, creating a gap between practical success and theoretical understanding.

Method: Analyzed SNGD and SPRING for idealized parametric optimization problems with linear models and strongly convex quadratic loss functions. Proved equivalence to regularized Kaczmarz methods and leveraged existing analyses to establish convergence rates.

Result: Established (i) first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) first convergence guarantee for SPRING, and (iii) first proof that SPRING can accelerate SNGD. Extended analysis to general strongly convex quadratic loss settings.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates how randomized linear algebra tools can illuminate the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware optimization, providing theoretical foundation for SNGD's empirical effectiveness.

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs can serve as valid proxies for human behavior in logistics and supply chain management simulations, as traditional agent-based models lack realistic human-like reasoning capabilities.

Method: Controlled experiment with 957 human participants (477 dyads) in food delivery scenarios, testing 6 state-of-the-art LLMs using moderated mediation design with Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) for equivalence and structural equation modeling (SEM) for decision process validation.

Result: Some LLMs demonstrate surface-level equivalence to humans but show artificial decision processes not present in human participants, revealing an equivalence-versus-process paradox.

Conclusion: GABMs can effectively simulate human behaviors in LSCM with proper dual validation, providing researchers with a framework for rigorous development and practitioners with evidence for LLM selection in operational tasks.

Abstract: Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) powered by large language models (LLMs)
offer promising potential for empirical logistics and supply chain management
(LSCM) research by enabling realistic simulation of complex human behaviors.
Unlike traditional agent-based models, GABMs generate human-like responses
through natural language reasoning, which creates potential for new
perspectives on emergent LSCM phenomena. However, the validity of LLMs as
proxies for human behavior in LSCM simulations is unknown. This study evaluates
LLM equivalence of human behavior through a controlled experiment examining
dyadic customer-worker engagements in food delivery scenarios. I test six
state-of-the-art LLMs against 957 human participants (477 dyads) using a
moderated mediation design. This study reveals a need to validate GABMs on two
levels: (1) human equivalence testing, and (2) decision process validation.
Results reveal GABMs can effectively simulate human behaviors in LSCM; however,
an equivalence-versus-process paradox emerges. While a series of Two One-Sided
Tests (TOST) for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level
equivalence to humans, structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals artificial
decision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs. These
findings show GABMs as a potentially viable methodological instrument in LSCM
with proper validation checks. The dual-validation framework also provides LSCM
researchers with a guide to rigorous GABM development. For practitioners, this
study offers evidence-based assessment for LLM selection for operational tasks.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Finite-horizon LQ games have unique Nash equilibria while infinite-horizon ones can have multiple. The paper shows finite-horizon equilibria form a dynamical system whose fixed points correspond to infinite-horizon equilibria, with periodic orbits representing periodic Nash equilibria.

Motivation: To clarify the relationship between finite-horizon and infinite-horizon linear quadratic games and understand how multiple equilibria emerge in infinite-horizon settings.

Method: Interpret finite-horizon equilibrium as a nonlinear dynamical system, analyze its fixed points and periodic orbits, and provide numerical simulations of convergence behavior.

Result: Fixed points of the finite-horizon dynamical system correspond exactly to infinite-horizon equilibria. Periodic orbits represent periodic Nash equilibria. Three asymptotic regimes identified: convergence to stationary equilibria, periodic equilibria, and bounded non-convergent trajectories.

Conclusion: The framework provides new insights and tools for tuning finite-horizon LQ games using infinite-horizon concepts, with applications in recovering various equilibrium types through appropriate terminal cost choices.

Abstract: Finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) games admit a unique Nash equilibrium,
while infinite-horizon settings may have multiple. We clarify the relationship
between these two cases by interpreting the finite-horizon equilibrium as a
nonlinear dynamical system. Within this framework, we prove that its fixed
points are exactly the infinite-horizon equilibria and that any such
equilibrium can be recovered by an appropriate choice of terminal costs. We
further show that periodic orbits of the dynamical system, when they arise,
correspond to periodic Nash equilibria, and we provide numerical evidence of
convergence to such cycles. Finally, simulations reveal three asymptotic
regimes: convergence to stationary equilibria, convergence to periodic
equilibria, and bounded non-convergent trajectories. These findings offer new
insights and tools for tuning finite-horizon LQ games using infinite-horizon.

### [90] [Evolution favours positively biased reasoning in sequential interactions with high future gains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20799)
*Marco Saponara,Elias Fernandez Domingos,Jorge M. Pacheco,Tom Lenaerts*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Evolutionary game theory model shows that positively biased reasoning strategies (like wishful thinking) outcompete rational strategies in social dilemmas, suggesting cognitive biases are adaptive features rather than flaws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the evolutionary roots of human cognitive biases that deviate from game-theoretical rationality, particularly why humans hold unrealistic expectations about future outcomes.

Method: Used Evolutionary Game Theory with a population deploying various level-k reasoning strategies in sequential interactions modeled by the Incremental Centipede Game. Compared unbiased rational strategies with positively biased (optimistic) and negatively biased (pessimistic) reasoning approaches.

Result: Selection consistently favored positively biased reasoning strategies over rational ones, with rational behavior going extinct. Positively biased agents co-existed with non-reasoning agents, forming novel equilibria. Longer games further promoted positively biased reasoning due to potential for higher future rewards.

Conclusion: Certain cognitive biases like wishful thinking constitute adaptive features that help individuals better cope with social dilemmas, explaining why they persist evolutionarily despite deviating from rational judgment.

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that human behaviour often deviates from
game-theoretical rationality. For instance, humans may hold unrealistic
expectations about future outcomes. As the evolutionary roots of such biases
remain unclear, we investigate here how reasoning abilities and cognitive
biases co-evolve using Evolutionary Game Theory. In our model, individuals in a
population deploy a variety of unbiased and biased level-k reasoning strategies
to anticipate others' behaviour in sequential interactions, represented by the
Incremental Centipede Game. Positively biased reasoning strategies have a
systematic inference bias towards higher but uncertain rewards, while
negatively biased strategies reflect the opposite tendency. We find that
selection consistently favours positively biased reasoning, with rational
behaviour even going extinct. This bias co-evolves with bounded rationality, as
the reasoning depth remains limited in the population. Interestingly,
positively biased agents may co-exist with non-reasoning agents, thus pointing
to a novel equilibrium. Longer games further promote positively biased
reasoning, as they can lead to higher future rewards. The biased reasoning
strategies proposed in this model may reflect cognitive phenomena like wishful
thinking and defensive pessimism. This work therefore supports the claim that
certain cognitive biases, despite deviating from rational judgment, constitute
an adaptive feature to better cope with social dilemmas.
