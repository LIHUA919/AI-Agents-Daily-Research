In this work, we introduce\n\\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature\ndescribing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines\nfor discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing\ninformation in concise fair-use facts. \\ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million\npairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.\nSMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,\nCLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets\nand evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \\ourdataset~is\nhighly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised\nprediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M\nlearnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and\nclassification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.\nModels built with \\ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for\nnovel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly\nas effective. We release our dataset at\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},\nand will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a dataset (\\ourdataset) of experimental priors for AI-driven therapeutic design, addressing the issue of mutagenic risks in AI-proposed molecules. The dataset, built using LLM pipelines, contains 32.3M natural language facts and entity representations. Models trained on this data outperform larger ones in therapeutic tasks and improve safety in molecule proposals.", "motivation": "AI-driven discovery often violates implicit constraints due to lack of experimental priors, leading to unsafe or ineffective designs (e.g., mutagenic molecules). This work aims to provide a dataset to embed such priors into AI models.", "method": "The dataset (\\ourdataset) is constructed using LLM pipelines to extract and summarize therapeutic facts from literature. Models (LLM, CLIP, LLava) are trained on this data for joint reasoning on text and design targets, evaluated on Therapeutic Data Commons tasks.", "result": "Models pretrained on \\ourdataset outperform larger models (e.g., 15M vs. 2B parameters) in regression and classification tasks. They also yield safer molecule proposals in GuacaMol while maintaining effectiveness.", "conclusion": "\\ourdataset enables AI models to incorporate experimental priors, improving safety and performance in therapeutic design. The dataset is publicly released and will expand with new literature."}}
