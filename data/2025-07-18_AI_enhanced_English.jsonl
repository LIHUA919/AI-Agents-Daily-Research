To address this issue, we propose FedGA, a fairness-aware federated\nlearning algorithm. We first employ the Gini coefficient to measure the\nperformance disparity among clients. Based on this, we establish a relationship\nbetween the Gini coefficient $G$ and the update scale of the global model\n${U_s}$, and use this relationship to adaptively determine the timing of\nfairness intervention. Subsequently, we dynamically adjust the aggregation\nweights according to the system's real-time fairness status, enabling the\nglobal model to better incorporate information from clients with relatively\npoor performance.We conduct extensive experiments on the Office-Caltech-10,\nCIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets.

This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates\ndiverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial\ninformation, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as\ndeveloping countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large\nlanguage model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM\nfunctioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable\neffective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains\ncontextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,\ncategorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.\nThese features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight\nconstraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also\nidentifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with\nnonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different\nstages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in\nestimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with\nlimited data availability.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoReg integrates satellite and geospatial data with LLM-derived features to estimate socio-economic indicators, outperforming baselines in data-scarce regions.", "motivation": "Addressing the lack of labeled data in developing countries for accurate socio-economic indicator estimation.", "method": "Uses LLM for feature extraction, categorizes feature correlations, and employs linear and nonlinear modeling with tailored constraints.", "result": "Outperforms baselines in estimating indicators across three countries, including low-income regions.", "conclusion": "GeoReg effectively estimates socio-economic indicators in data-scarce areas, aiding policy decisions."}}

To combat these\nproblems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from\nLipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point\nwhere researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with\na Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we\nbegin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for\nmaintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able\nto train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.\nWe find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves\nstandard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models\nto reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's\nupdate having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method\nthat improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter\ntransformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches\nvalidation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz\ntransformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the\nNanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound\nincreases to 10^264.
