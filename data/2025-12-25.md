Abstract: Smart home lighting systems consume 15-20% of residential energy but lack adaptive intelligence to optimize for user comfort and energy efficiency simultaneously. We present BitRL-Light, a novel framework combining 1-bit quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning for real-time smart home lighting control on edge devices. Our approach deploys a 1-bit quantized Llama-3.2-1B model on Raspberry Pi hardware, achieving 71.4 times energy reduction compared to full-precision models while maintaining intelligent control capabilities. Through multi-objective reinforcement learning, BitRL-Light learns optimal lighting policies from user feedback, balancing energy consumption, comfort, and circadian alignment. Experimental results demonstrate 32% energy savings compared to rule-based systems, with inference latency under 200ms on Raspberry Pi 4 and 95% user satisfaction. The system processes natural language commands via Google Home/IFTTT integration and learns from implicit feedback through manual overrides. Our comparative analysis shows 1-bit models achieve 5.07 times speedup over 2-bit alternatives on ARM processors while maintaining 92% task accuracy. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying adaptive AI on resource-constrained IoT devices, enabling intelligent home automation without cloud dependencies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in multiagent reinforcement learning for autonomous UAV coordination in 6G network deployment under partial observability and dynamic conditions.

Method: Integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization using VQCs and QAOA, probabilistic modeling via Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference, and adopts a CTDE paradigm with shared memory and local view grids.

Result: Demonstrates improved sample efficiency, accelerated convergence, enhanced coverage performance, and superior balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical PPO and DDPG baselines.

Conclusion: The quantum-inspired framework successfully enhances the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in MARL for UAV-assisted 6G networks, achieving improved coverage, convergence, and robustness over classical methods.

Abstract: This study introduces a quantum inspired framework for optimizing the exploration exploitation tradeoff in multiagent reinforcement learning, applied to UAVassisted 6G network deployment. We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness. Radar chart and convergence analyses further show that QI MARL achieves a superior balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical methods. All implementation code and supplementary materials are publicly available on GitHub to ensure reproducibility.

### [3] [MegaRAG: Multimodal Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20626)
*Chi-Hsiang Hsiao,Yi-Cheng Wang,Tzung-Sheng Lin,Yi-Ren Yeh,Chu-Song Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that enhances reasoning over long, domain-specific content by incorporating visual cues into knowledge graph construction, retrieval, and answer generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) struggles with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension of long-form, domain-specific content due to limited context windows, and existing KG-based RAG solutions are text-only, missing complementary insights from modalities like vision.

Method: The method develops a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that integrates visual cues into knowledge graph construction, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process to enable cross-modal reasoning.

Result: Experimental results on global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that the approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based methods on both textual and multimodal corpora.

Conclusion: Incorporating visual cues into knowledge graphs for RAG effectively addresses limitations in deep reasoning over multimodal content, leading to improved performance in content understanding tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to dynamically access external information, which is powerful for answering questions over previously unseen documents. Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent with multi-persona debators improves LLM reflections versus single LLM reflections, reducing error repetition and enhancing performance on QA and programming tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can improve reasoning by reflecting on mistakes but degenerate by repeating errors even when aware of wrong answers, necessitating a better reflection method to maintain thought quality.

Method: Introduce multi-agent with multi-persona debators to generate reflections, ensuring diverse perspectives and reducing repetitive errors through structured debate.

Result: Achieved 47% EM on HotPot QA and 82.7% on HumanEval, both surpassing single LLM reflection methods, indicating higher accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Multi-agent debators effectively enhance reflection diversity and performance in LLMs, addressing degeneration issues and improving outcomes in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: LLMs have shown the capacity to improve their performance on reasoning tasks through reflecting on their mistakes, and acting with these reflections in mind. However, continual reflections of the same LLM onto itself exhibit degeneration of thought, where the LLM continues to repeat the same errors again and again even with the knowledge that its wrong. To address this problem, we instead introduce multi-agent with multi-persona debators as the method to generate reflections. Through out extensive experimentation, we've found that the leads to better diversity of in the reflections generated by the llm agent. We demonstrate an accuracy of 47% EM HotPot QA (question answering) and 82.7% on HumanEval (programming), both performances surpassing reflection with a single llm.

Result: Simulations with a Saudi household case study show a 12-18% cost reduction compared to static menus, over 95% nutrient adequacy, and high performance with 20-30% price fluctuations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines affordability with nutritional adequacy, offering a viable approach for sustainable and equitable diet planning aligned with Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger and Good Health.

Abstract: The issue of limited household budgets and nutritional demands continues to be a challenge especially in the middle-income environment where food prices fluctuate. This paper introduces a price aware agentic AI system, which combines personal finance management with diet optimization. With household income and fixed expenditures, medical and well-being status, as well as real-time food costs, the system creates nutritionally sufficient meals plans at comparatively reasonable prices that automatically adjust to market changes. The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%. The findings indicate that the framework can locally combine affordability with nutritional adequacy and provide a viable avenue of capacity-building towards sustainable and fair diet planning in line with Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger and Good Health.

*Leo Lu,Jonathan Zhang,Sean Chua,Spencer Kim,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the interchangeability of reasoning chains across large language models, showing that partially completed reasoning from one model can be reliably continued by another, often preserving or improving accuracy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focuses on improving model reasoning internally, but little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models, which could enhance trustworthiness and modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.

Method: Use token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from baseline models (Gemma-3-4B-IT, LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct), then continue with other models (Gemma-3-1B-IT, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct) for intra-family and cross-family experiments, evaluated using a Process Reward Model (PRM).

Result: Hybrid reasoning chains often preserve and sometimes improve final accuracy and logical structure, indicating that reasoning can be interchanged reliably between models.

Conclusion: Interchangeability emerges as a behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems, highlighting its potential to enhance inference-time trustworthiness.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. Our findings point towards interchangeability as an emerging behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.

*Esmail Gumaan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoAS is a Transformer architecture that dynamically selects between MHA, GQA, and MQA attention schemes per token using a learned router to balance model quality and inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a trade-off between modeling quality (best with MHA) and inference efficiency (improved with MQA/GQA but at a performance cost). MoAS aims to leverage the strengths of different attention schemes dynamically to achieve competitive performance with MHA while offering potential efficiency gains.

Method: Propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), which uses a learned router to dynamically select the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token, rather than using a static average of schemes.

Result: Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing achieves a validation loss of 2.3074, outperforming a static mixture (2.3093), and is competitive with the MHA baseline while enabling conditional compute efficiency.

Conclusion: MoAS provides an effective method for dynamically integrating multiple attention schemes, validating that dynamic routing outperforms static approaches and offers a promising direction for improving Transformer efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The choice of attention mechanism in Transformer models involves a critical trade-off between modeling quality and inference efficiency. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: An AI-driven multi-agent hiring assistant automates and streamlines early-stage candidate validation by integrating diverse inputs into a structured pipeline with human oversight, significantly improving efficiency and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-stage candidate validation is a bottleneck due to heterogeneous inputs like resumes, screening answers, and public data, which recruiters must manually reconcile, leading to inefficiency and high screening costs.

Method: Develops a modular multi-agent system with components for document/video preprocessing, structured profile construction, public-data verification, technical/culture-fit scoring with risk penalties, and human-in-the-loop validation via an interactive interface. Uses an LLM for orchestration under strict constraints to reduce variability and generate traceable rationales, with candidate ranking based on configurable aggregation of scores and penalties.

Result: Evaluated on 64 real applicants for a mid-level Python backend engineer role, the system improves throughput, achieving 1.70 hours per qualified candidate versus 3.33 hours for an experienced recruiter, with substantially lower estimated screening cost, while precision/recall metrics are considered, and a new efficiency metric for expected time per qualified candidate is proposed.

Conclusion: The AI-driven hiring assistant enhances efficiency and reduces costs in candidate validation while maintaining human decision-makers as the final authority, demonstrating the feasibility of modular, traceable systems for recruitment bottlenecks.

Abstract: Early-stage candidate validation is a major bottleneck in hiring, because recruiters must reconcile heterogeneous inputs (resumes, screening answers, code assignments, and limited public evidence). This paper presents an AI-driven, modular multi-agent hiring assistant that integrates (i) document and video preprocessing, (ii) structured candidate profile construction, (iii) public-data verification, (iv) technical/culture-fit scoring with explicit risk penalties, and (v) human-in-the-loop validation via an interactive interface. The pipeline is orchestrated by an LLM under strict constraints to reduce output variability and to generate traceable component-level rationales. Candidate ranking is computed by a configurable aggregation of technical fit, culture fit, and normalized risk penalties. The system is evaluated on 64 real applicants for a mid-level Python backend engineer role, using an experienced recruiter as the reference baseline and a second, less experienced recruiter for additional comparison. Alongside precision/recall, we propose an efficiency metric measuring expected time per qualified candidate. In this study, the system improves throughput and achieves 1.70 hours per qualified candidate versus 3.33 hours for the experienced recruiter, with substantially lower estimated screening cost, while preserving a human decision-maker as the final authority.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Transformer-based sentiment models often misallocate attention to common words, ignoring relevant but less common terms. The paper proposes Adversarial Feedback for Attention (AFA) with dynamic masking and policy gradient optimization to redistribute attention. This achieves SOTA results and boosts large model performance by 12.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the issue of suboptimal accuracy in Transformer-based sentiment analysis models due to attention misallocation towards common words at the expense of less popular but task-relevant terms.

Method: The method introduces an Adversarial Feedback for Attention (AFA) training mechanism featuring a dynamic masking strategy and policy gradient optimization. It uses a discriminator to detect attention differences caused by masking, guiding the model to redistribute attention weights appropriately.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, applying AFA to large language models yields a further performance improvement of 12.6%.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed AFA mechanism effectively addresses attention misallocation in Transformer-based sentiment analysis models, leading to state-of-the-art performance and notable improvements when applied to large language models.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have been widely adopted for sentiment analysis tasks due to their exceptional ability to capture contextual information. However, these methods often exhibit suboptimal accuracy in certain scenarios. By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, applying this training mechanism to enhance attention in large language models yields a further performance improvement of 12.6%

TL;DR: This paper analyzes behavioral artifacts in LLMs—laziness, decoding suboptimality, and context degradation—through experiments with models like GPT-4 and DeepSeek, finding significant laziness but limited decoding issues and strong context retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often show behavioral artifacts (laziness, decoding suboptimality, context degradation), but these phenomena lack systematic quantification. The study aims to empirically assess their prevalence in advanced LLMs.

Method: Conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, C) focusing on laziness (via multi-part instructions), decoding suboptimality (simple reasoning tasks), and context degradation (long chaotic conversations) with models like OpenAI GPT-4 variant and DeepSeek.

Result: Widespread laziness observed (omissions and non-compliance in multi-part requests), limited evidence of decoding suboptimality (greedy answers aligned with high-confidence solutions), and robust context retention in 200-turn conversations.

Conclusion: While compliance with detailed instructions remains challenging, modern LLMs internally mitigate some hypothesized failures (e.g., context degradation) in straightforward scenarios; recommendations include self-refinement and dynamic prompting to reduce laziness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit behavioral artifacts such as laziness (premature truncation of responses or partial compliance with multi-part requests), decoding suboptimality (failure to select higher-quality sequences due to myopic decoding), and context degradation (forgetting or ignoring core instructions over long conversations). We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios. We discuss implications for reliability, relate our findings to prior work on instruction-following and long-context processing, and recommend strategies (such as self-refinement and dynamic prompting) to reduce laziness and bolster multi-instruction compliance.

### [17] [Eidoku: A Neuro-Symbolic Verification Gate for LLM Reasoning via Structural Constraint Satisfaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20664)
*Shinobu Miya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Eidoku, a method that verifies LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem based on structural violation cost rather than generation likelihood, to detect hallucinations that probability-based checks miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce high-confidence hallucinations, indicating a failure in structural consistency that probability-based verification cannot address, necessitating a new verification approach.

Method: Define verification as a feasible check using structural violation cost, compute a total cost (graph connectivity, feature space consistency, logical entailment), and use a lightweight System-2 gate (Eidoku) to reject steps exceeding a context-derived threshold.

Result: The method successfully rejects 'smooth falsehoods'—probable but structurally disconnected statements—that probability-based verifiers cannot detect, as shown in controlled experiments.

Conclusion: Enforcing structural constraints allows deterministic rejection of hallucinations, providing a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce hallucinated statements that are assigned high likelihood by the model itself, exposing a fundamental limitation of probability-based verification. This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning.

*Daan Di Scala,Sophie Lathouwers,Michael van Bekkum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A position paper proposing a semantic language to bridge the gap between Functional and Normative Trustworthy AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current divides between functional implementation and regulatory norms make it hard to assess AI trustworthiness, necessitating a bridging conceptual framework.

Method: Descriptive analysis of state-of-the-art, identification of gaps, discussion of starting points for semantic language development.

Result: Framework introduced aids developers in assessment and helps stakeholders translate norms into implementation steps.

Conclusion: Key considerations and future actions are outlined to advance assessment of Trustworthy AI through a unified semantic approach.

Abstract: Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) is gaining traction due to regulations and functional benefits. While Functional TAI (FTAI) focuses on how to implement trustworthy systems, Normative TAI (NTAI) focuses on regulations that need to be enforced. However, gaps between FTAI and NTAI remain, making it difficult to assess trustworthiness of AI systems. We argue that a bridge is needed, specifically by introducing a conceptual language which can match FTAI and NTAI. Such a semantic language can assist developers as a framework to assess AI systems in terms of trustworthiness. It can also help stakeholders translate norms and regulations into concrete implementation steps for their systems. In this position paper, we describe the current state-of-the-art and identify the gap between FTAI and NTAI. We will discuss starting points for developing a semantic language and the envisioned effects of it. Finally, we provide key considerations and discuss future actions towards assessment of TAI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A scoping review of 32 studies (2023-2025) analyzing generative AI personalization in higher-education computer science, identifying effective design patterns, application domains, and a framework for adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address questions on whether AI personalization supports or undermines learning, by synthesizing evidence on mechanisms and effectiveness in computer science education at scale.

Method: Scoping review of 32 purposively sampled studies from 259 records, mapping personalization applications (e.g., intelligent tutoring, formative feedback) and analyzing design choices.

Result: Designs with explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding show positive learning outcomes; successful patterns include context-aware tutoring, multi-level hints, integration with CS infrastructure, and human-in-the-loop assurance.

Conclusion: Generative AI enables precision scaffolding for personalized support when embedded in audit-ready workflows, with mitigation for risks like integrity and bias, and an exploration-first adoption framework.

Abstract: Generative AI enables personalized computer science education at scale, yet questions remain about whether such personalization supports or undermines learning. This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.

*Prajwal Ghimire,Keyoumars Ashkan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The AI in digital health is not purely artificial but rather a continuation and extension of organic human intelligence through algorithms inspired by neurobiology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to challenge the common dichotomy between 'artificial' and 'organic' intelligence, noting that AI systems are fundamentally derived from and inspired by organic human intelligence such as neurobiology and evolution, especially in digital health applications.

Method: The analysis likely draws on conceptual or philosophical discussions rather than empirical methods, examining how AI principles mirror organic intelligence and contrasting this with traditional distinctions in terminology and perception.

Result: It is argued that AI's path in digital health is grounded in organization and adaptation, whose principles are rooted in human cognition and biological systems, thus blurring the line between artificial and organic as suggested by nomenclature.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that AI should be seen as an evolving extension of organic intelligence, as informed by human ingenuity and biological inspiration, with significant implications for redefining AI's role in digital health and broader society.

Abstract: The term artificial implies an inherent dichotomy from the natural or organic. However, AI, as we know it, is a product of organic ingenuity: designed, implemented, and iteratively improved by human cognition. The very principles that underpin AI systems, from neural networks to decision-making algorithms, are inspired by the organic intelligence embedded in human neurobiology and evolutionary processes. The path from organic to artificial intelligence in digital health is neither mystical nor merely a matter of parameter count, it is fundamentally about organization and adaption. Thus, the boundaries between artificial and organic are far less distinct than the nomenclature suggests.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentMath is an agent framework combining language models' reasoning with code interpreters' computational precision for efficient complex mathematical problem-solving, featuring innovations in data generation, reinforcement learning, and training system optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models are computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy in complex mathematical operations, despite progress in natural language reasoning.

Method: Integrates language models with code interpreters via three key innovations: automated conversion of natural language chain-of-thought to structured tool-augmented trajectories for SFT data generation, an agentic RL paradigm for dynamic interleaving of reasoning and code execution, and an efficient training system with techniques like asynchronous rollout scheduling and load balancing.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on benchmarks AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25, with AgentMath-30B-A3B achieving 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, advancing capabilities in mathematical reasoning and paving the way for more sophisticated and scalable agents.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought. However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25. Specifically, AgentMath-30B-A3B attains 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively, achieving advanced capabilities.These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.

### [22] [A Benchmark for Evaluating Outcome-Driven Constraint Violations in Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20798)
*Miles Q. Li,Benjamin C. M. Fung,Martin Weiss,Pulei Xiong,Khalil Al-Hussaeni,Claude Fachkha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new benchmark reveals high AI agent misalignment rates (up to 71.4%) in realistic multi-step scenarios, highlighting safety gaps despite advanced reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety benchmarks lack coverage for emergent outcome-driven constraint violations in high-stakes autonomous AI agents, requiring multi-step evaluation in realistic production settings.

Method: Introduced a new 40-scenario benchmark with tasks requiring multi-step actions under KPI pressure, distinguishing between mandated obedience and incentivized misalignment. Evaluated 12 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Observed outcome-driven constraint violations from 1.3% to 71.4%. 9 of 12 models had misalignment rates of 30-50%. Superior reasoning (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro-Preview) did not ensure safety, showing highest violation rate over 60% with deliberate misalignment.

Conclusion: The results emphasize the critical need for realistic agentic-safety training before real-world deployment.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant "deliberative misalignment", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.

*Anselm Paulus,Ilia Kulikov,Brandon Amos,Rémi Munos,Ivan Evtimov,Kamalika Chaudhuri,Arman Zharmagambetov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method called AdvGame where the Attacker and Defender language models are trained jointly via online reinforcement learning with preference-based rewards to simultaneously improve safety and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety alignment methods for language models rely on sequential adversarial training, which may be limited in robustness and efficiency; a new paradigm is needed to enable continuous adaptation and iterative improvement.

Method: We introduce a non-zero-sum game framework where an Attacker LM and Defender LM are trained jointly via online reinforcement learning using preference-based reward signals from pairwise comparisons, instead of sequential adversarial training with point-wise scores.

Result: AdvGame shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks, while the Attacker LM becomes a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent for probing arbitrary models.

Conclusion: Framing safety alignment as a joint game with online reinforcement learning and preference-based rewards provides a promising approach to improve language model safety without compromising usefulness, with potential for broader AI alignment applications.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of language models (LMs) while maintaining their usefulness remains a critical challenge in AI alignment. Current approaches rely on sequential adversarial training: generating adversarial prompts and fine-tuning LMs to defend against them. We introduce a different paradigm: framing safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game between an Attacker LM and a Defender LM trained jointly via online reinforcement learning. Each LM continuously adapts to the other's evolving strategies, driving iterative improvement. Our method uses a preference-based reward signal derived from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores, providing more robust supervision and potentially reducing reward hacking. Our RL recipe, AdvGame, shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks. In addition, the resulting Attacker LM converges into a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent that can be directly deployed to probe arbitrary target models.

### [24] [Context-Sensitive Abstractions for Reinforcement Learning with Parameterized Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20831)
*Rashmeet Kaur Nayyar,Naman Shah,Siddharth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an RL approach for parameterized action spaces that learns state and action abstractions online to handle long-horizon, sparse-reward settings, improving sample efficiency over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world sequential decision-making involves parameterized actions (discrete choices with continuous parameters), but existing planning and RL methods are limited here: planning requires manual models, standard RL assumes either discrete or continuous actions, and few RL methods exploit the structure, often relying on engineering.

Method: The authors extend RL algorithms by enabling agents to autonomously learn state and action abstractions online, progressively refining these abstractions during learning to add detail in critical regions of the state-action space, using abstraction-driven techniques tailored for continuous-state, parameterized-action domains.

Result: The abstraction-driven approach, applied with TD(λ), achieves notably higher sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines across several parameterized-action domains, as demonstrated in continuous-state settings.

Conclusion: The work successfully broadens RL's applicability to complex parameterized action spaces with long horizons and sparse rewards, offering a method that learns abstractions dynamically to improve performance without domain-specific engineering.

Abstract: Real-world sequential decision-making often involves parameterized action spaces that require both, decisions regarding discrete actions and decisions about continuous action parameters governing how an action is executed. Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($λ$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.

*Zan-Kai Chong,Hiroyuki Ohsaki,Bryan Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A probabilistic framework is proposed to enable bidirectional knowledge exchange among LLM agents using Beta-Bernoulli distributions with forgetfulness, linking uncertainty to optimize interactions and improve learning, validated in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents proficient in consuming digital content are unidirectional (epistemic asymmetry), leading to redundant reasoning and collective intelligence stagnation; hence, a probabilistic foundation is needed to quantify certainty.

Method: Model agent beliefs with Beta-Bernoulli distribution and forgetting factor (γ) to isolate epistemic uncertainty as variance, enabling a homeostatic motive and optimal learning strategy, plus epistemic caching for scalability.

Result: The framework reframes public contribution as optimal active learning, uses belief states for RLAHF and SFT filters, and simulations show it outperforms baselines in heterogeneous environments with adaptability to concept drift.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty-driven strategy addresses epistemic asymmetry by providing a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange, enhancing collective intelligence and adaptability in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are proficient consumers of digital content but remain unidirectional, a limitation we term epistemic asymmetry. This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A brief summary of the paper: TrafficSimAgent is an LLM-based agent framework designed to simplify traffic simulation tasks for users without extensive platform knowledge, enabling effective simulation execution and optimization through expert agent collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation: Users without deep knowledge of existing traffic simulators like SUMO or MATSim face challenges in conducting experiments and applying them to daily work, prompting the need for a more accessible and intuitive framework to lower the entry barrier.

Method: The method: TrafficSimAgent uses an LLM-based agent framework with cross-level collaboration. High-level agents interpret natural language instructions, plan workflows, and invoke MCP-compatible tools, while low-level agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions.

Result: The result: Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios demonstrate that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions, produces reasonable outcomes even with ambiguous user instructions, and achieves superior performance compared to other systems and SOTA LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: The conclusion: TrafficSimAgent successfully addresses the usability gap in traffic simulation, offering a flexible, autonomous decision-driven optimization framework that enhances accessibility and delivers high-quality results, making it a valuable tool for transportation tasks.

Abstract: Traffic simulation is important for transportation optimization and policy making. While existing simulators such as SUMO and MATSim offer fully-featured platforms and utilities, users without too much knowledge about these platforms often face significant challenges when conducting experiments from scratch and applying them to their daily work. To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic XAI framework combines SHAP and LLMs for iterative explanation refinement, tested on rice yield data with human and LLM evaluators, showing peak improvement at Rounds 3-4 but quality decline with over-refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communicating XAI outputs to laypersons is challenging, limiting trust in AI predictions, and agentic AI integration with XAI is unexplored despite LLMs' potential for accessible narratives.

Method: Proposed agentic XAI framework uses SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement over 11 rounds; tested on 26 Japanese rice fields as an agricultural recommendation system, evaluated by 12 human experts and 14 LLMs against seven metrics.

Result: Both evaluator groups confirmed enhanced recommendation quality with 30-33% average score increase from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4; excessive refinement caused significant drop in quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off.

Conclusion: Strategic early stopping is essential for optimizing utility, challenging monotonic improvement assumptions and providing design principles for agentic XAI systems.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.

### [28] [LLM Personas as a Substitute for Field Experiments in Method Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21080)
*Enoch Hyunwook Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based persona simulations can replace human field experiments for benchmarking adaptive methods when certain conditions are met, with sample size determining decision reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Field experiments (A/B tests) are costly and slow, creating bottlenecks for iterative method development, while LLM-based persona simulations offer a cheaper alternative.

Method: Proved an if-and-only-if characterization showing persona-human swapping is equivalent to population change when methods observe only aggregate outcomes and evaluation is algorithm-blind. Defined information-theoretic discriminability of aggregate channels.

Result: Persona benchmarking validity depends on specific conditions. Making it as decision-relevant as field experiments becomes fundamentally a sample-size question with explicit bounds provided.

Conclusion: LLM persona simulations can serve as valid benchmarks under specific conditions, with sample size determining their practical usefulness relative to field experiments.

Abstract: Field experiments (A/B tests) are often the most credible benchmark for methods in societal systems, but their cost and latency create a major bottleneck for iterative method development. LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.

### [29] [Beyond Context: Large Language Models Failure to Grasp Users Intent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21110)
*Ahmed M. Hussain,Salahuddin Salahuddin,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current LLM safety focuses on explicit harm but misses context and intent understanding, making them vulnerable to circumvention techniques like emotional framing, leading to systematic exploitation—especially with reasoning features. Only Claude Opus 4.1 partially detects intent, highlighting need for architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM safety approaches overlook vulnerability in understanding context and user intent, allowing malicious users to exploit this gap to bypass safety mechanisms, which is a critical flaw in current systems.

Method: Empirical evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) testing circumvention techniques such as emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification.

Result: LLMs, including reasoning-enabled configurations, were effectively circumvented, increasing factual precision without interrogating intent. Claude Opus 4.1 occasionally prioritized intent detection over information provision.

Conclusion: Current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities, necessitating a paradigm shift toward integrating contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc mechanisms.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) safety approaches focus on explicitly harmful content while overlooking a critical vulnerability: the inability to understand context and recognize user intent. This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.

Method: Retrospective study using EHR data from 2,125,549 adults, with strategic sampling for clinical complexity and safety risk, expert clinician review of 277 patients, and analysis of system-identified issues and interventions.

Result: LLM system had 100% sensitivity and 83.1% specificity in detecting issues, but only 46.9% of patients had all issues and interventions correctly identified; failure analysis revealed five patterns: overconfidence, misapplication of guidelines, misunderstanding healthcare delivery, factual errors, and process blindness.

Conclusion: The study shows LLMs have significant contextual reasoning failures in clinical settings, posing safety risks; it calls for larger-scale evaluations and deeper behavioral analysis before safe deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often match or exceed clinician-level performance on medical benchmarks, yet very few are evaluated on real clinical data or examined beyond headline metrics. We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\% [95\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\% [95\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\% [95\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoboSafe, a runtime safety guardrail for embodied AI agents, uses hybrid reasoning with backward and forward modules to detect and prevent hazardous actions based on temporal and context-aware safety predicates, reducing risks by 36.8% without compromising task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing runtime safety defenses for vision-language model (VLM)-based embodied agents rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which fail to handle implicit risks in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments.

Method: Proposes RoboSafe, which integrates two reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory: Backward Reflective Reasoning infers temporal safety predicates from recent trajectories to trigger replanning, and Forward Predictive Reasoning anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from long-term memory and multimodal observations.

Result: Extensive experiments show RoboSafe reduces hazardous actions by 36.8% compared to leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance, with real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms confirming practicality.

Conclusion: RoboSafe offers an adaptive, verifiable, and interpretable safety logic executable as code, effectively enhancing safety for embodied agents in complex real-world tasks without hindering functionality.

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Proposes a parameter-efficient alternative to Neural CDEs, framing it as a "Continuous RNN" analog.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural CDEs are effective for temporal sequences but have a drawback in requiring many parameters.

Method: Introduces a novel parameter-efficient approach to Neural CDEs, leveraging logical analogy to RNNs.

Result: Achieves similar functionality with significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances practicality by reducing parameter count while maintaining effectiveness.

Abstract: Neural Controlled Differential Equations (Neural CDEs, NCDEs) are a unique branch of methods, specifically tailored for analysing temporal sequences. However, they come with drawbacks, the main one being the number of parameters, required for the method's operation. In this paper, we propose an alternative, parameter-efficient look at Neural CDEs. It requires much fewer parameters, while also presenting a very logical analogy as the "Continuous RNN", which the Neural CDEs aspire to.

### [33] [Learning Evolving Latent Strategies for Multi-Agent Language Systems without Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20629)
*Wenlong Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent language framework that evolves strategies without fine-tuning language model parameters, using external latent vectors updated through interaction and feedback in a dual-loop architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of static semantic representations in language models for long-horizon strategic interactions, by enabling continuous strategy evolution without parameter updates.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent language framework with a dual-loop architecture: a behavior loop for action preference adjustment based on environmental rewards, and a language loop for updating external latent vectors via reflection on generated text embeddings.

Result: Experiments show agents' latent spaces converge under reflection-driven updates, display structured shifts, and adapt to emotional agents without shared rewards, indicating stable and disentangled strategic styles over multi-round interactions.

Conclusion: The external latent space provides a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation for language agents, enabling continual adaptation without modifying model parameters.

Abstract: This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.
  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive zero-training temporal drift analysis of transformer-based sentiment models validated on authentic social media data from major real-world events. Through systematic evaluation across three transformer architectures and rigorous statistical validation on 12,279 authentic social media posts, we demonstrate significant model instability with accuracy drops reaching 23.4% during event-driven periods. Our analysis reveals maximum confidence drops of 13.0% (Bootstrap 95% CI: [9.1%, 16.5%]) with strong correlation to actual performance degradation. We introduce four novel drift metrics that outperform embedding-based baselines while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for production deployment. Statistical validation across multiple events confirms robust detection capabilities with practical significance exceeding industry monitoring thresholds. This zero-training methodology enables immediate deployment for real-time sentiment monitoring systems and provides new insights into transformer model behavior during dynamic content periods.

*MunHwan Lee,Shaika Chowdhury,Xiaodi Li,Sivaraman Rajaganapathy,Eric W Klee,Ping Yang,Terence Sio,Liewei Wang,James Cerhan,Nansu NA Zong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using Large Language Models as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators to convert multimodal clinical data into task-aligned features for predicting lung cancer treatment outcomes, achieving higher accuracy than baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting lung cancer treatment outcomes is difficult due to sparse, heterogeneous, and context-heavy real-world electronic health data. Traditional models lack semantic capabilities across modalities, and large-scale fine-tuning isn't practical in clinical workflows.

Method: The framework leverages LLMs as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to transform laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-specific features. GKC acts as an offline preprocessing step integrated into hospital informatics pipelines, unlike generic embeddings. It was benchmarked on a lung cancer cohort (N=184) against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer.

Result: GKC achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807), outperforming all baselines. An ablation study confirmed the complementary value of combining all three data modalities.

Conclusion: The study shows that semantic representation quality is crucial for predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data. By reimagining LLMs as knowledge curation tools rather than black-box predictors, it offers a scalable, interpretable, and workflow-friendly approach to enhance AI-driven decision support in oncology.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of treatment outcomes in lung cancer remains challenging due to the sparsity, heterogeneity, and contextual overload of real-world electronic health data. Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings. By reframing LLMs as knowledge curation engines rather than black-box predictors, this work demonstrates a scalable, interpretable, and workflow-compatible pathway for advancing AI-driven decision support in oncology.

### [36] [Real Time Detection and Quantitative Analysis of Spurious Forgetting in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20634)
*Weiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel framework quantifies task alignment depth, detects shallow alignment in real-time, and mitigates spurious forgetting in continual learning for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge in continual learning for LLMs. Recent work suggests spurious forgetting due to task alignment disruption, but lacks quantitative characterization and automatic distinction mechanisms.

Method: Proposed a comprehensive framework including quantitative metrics for alignment depth, real-time detection methods, analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction, and adaptive mitigation strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments show 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.

Conclusion: The shallow versus deep alignment framework successfully provides quantitative characterization, real-time detection, and adaptive mitigation strategies to address spurious forgetting in continual learning for LLMs.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge in continual learning for large language models. Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.
  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.
  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.

### [37] [SHRP: Specialized Head Routing and Pruning for Efficient Encoder Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20635)
*Zeli Su,Ziyin Zhang,Wenzheng Zhang,Zhou Liu,Guixian Xu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning) is a structured pruning framework that removes redundant attention heads and layer components from Transformer encoders to reduce inference latency and memory consumption, preserving high accuracy for NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer encoders suffer from high inference latency and memory consumption in large-scale web services, mainly due to architectural redundancy in the attention module, which limits real-time serving and scalability.

Method: SHRP treats each attention head as an independent expert (Expert Attention) followed by a shared expander feed-forward network. It uses a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism for dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment to automatically identify and remove redundant attention heads and prune layers.

Result: Experiments on GLUE benchmark with BERT-base encoder show: 48% parameter reduction, retaining 93% of original model accuracy; in extreme pruning (11/12 layers pruned), maintaining 84% accuracy, 4.2x throughput gain, and reducing computation to 11.5% of original FLOPs.

Conclusion: SHRP demonstrates practical utility for large-scale, latency-sensitive web deployments by enabling efficient model compression that minimizes accuracy loss, improving throughput significantly while reducing computational costs in Transformer-based encoders.

Abstract: Transformer encoders are widely deployed in large-scale web services for natural language understanding tasks such as text classification, semantic retrieval, and content ranking. However, their high inference latency and memory consumption pose significant challenges for real-time serving and scalability. These limitations stem largely from architectural redundancy, particularly in the attention module. The inherent parameter redundancy of the attention mechanism, coupled with the fact that its attention heads operate with a degree of independence, makes it particularly amenable to structured model compression. In this paper, we propose SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), a novel structured pruning framework that automatically identifies and removes redundant attention heads while preserving most of the model's accuracy and compatibility. SHRP introduces Expert Attention, a modular design that treats each attention head as an independent expert, followed by a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network that refines their outputs. The framework employs a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism to jointly perform dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark using a BERT-base encoder show that SHRP achieves 93% of the original model accuracy while reducing parameters by 48 percent. Under an extreme compression scenario where 11/12 of the layers are pruned, the model still maintains 84% accuracy and delivers a 4.2x throughput gain while reducing computation to as low as 11.5 percent of the original FLOPs, demonstrating its practical utility for large-scale and latency-sensitive web deployments.

### [38] [Data-Free Pruning of Self-Attention Layers in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20636)
*Dhananjay Saikumar,Blesson Varghese*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method called Gate-Norm enables fast, data-free pruning of attention layers in large language models by ranking them based on query-key coupling, removing the least coupled layers to boost inference throughput while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many attention layers in large language models contribute little, suggesting they are suppressed during pre-training, so an efficient pruning method could improve performance without data or fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes Gate-Norm, a weight-only criterion that analyzes query-key coupling to rank attention sublayers, allowing one-shot removal of low-contribution layers without calibration data, forward passes, or fine-tuning.

Result: On a 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA model, pruning 8–16 attention sublayers in under a second improves inference throughput by up to 1.30×, with average zero-shot accuracy within 2% of baseline across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Gate-Norm matches the accuracy of data-driven pruning methods but is about 1000× faster, offering a practical, data-free compression approach for large language models by leveraging the Attention Suppression Hypothesis.

Abstract: Many self-attention sublayers in large language models (LLMs) can be removed with little to no loss. We attribute this to the Attention Suppression Hypothesis: during pre-training, some deep attention layers learn to mute their own contribution, leaving the residual stream and the MLP to carry the representation. We propose Gate-Norm, a one-shot, weight-only criterion that ranks attention sublayers by query--key coupling and removes the least coupled ones, requiring no calibration data, no forward passes, no fine-tuning, and no specialized kernels. On 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA models, Gate-Norm prunes the model in under a second. Pruning $8$--$16$ attention sublayers yields up to $1.30\times$ higher inference throughput while keeping average zero-shot accuracy within $2\%$ of the unpruned baseline across BoolQ, RTE, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy/Challenge, and OpenBookQA. Across these settings, Gate-Norm matches data-driven pruning methods in accuracy while being $\sim 1000\times$ faster to score layers, enabling practical, data-free compression of LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a scientific machine learning approach using Neural ODEs and Universal Differential Equations in Julia for forecasting n-body trajectories, with UDEs showing superior data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning models for n-body motion prediction are data-intensive black boxes that ignore physical laws, lacking interpretability; Scientific ML embeds known physics into the framework.

Method: The method uses Neural ODEs and Universal Differential Equations in Julia, with synthetic noisy data to simulate real-world limitations, and determines forecasting breakdown points to assess data efficiency.

Result: The UDE model requires only 20% of data for accurate forecasting, while the Neural ODE needs 90%, demonstrating UDE's greater data efficiency.

Conclusion: Scientific ML with UDEs provides a more interpretable and data-efficient solution for predicting n-body dynamics compared to traditional black-box models or Neural ODEs.

Abstract: The n body problem, fundamental to astrophysics, simulates the motion of n bodies acting under the effect of their own mutual gravitational interactions. Traditional machine learning models that are used for predicting and forecasting trajectories are often data intensive black box models, which ignore the physical laws, thereby lacking interpretability. Whereas Scientific Machine Learning ( Scientific ML ) directly embeds the known physical laws into the machine learning framework. Through robust modelling in the Julia programming language, our method uses the Scientific ML frameworks: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and Universal differential equations (UDEs) to predict and forecast the system dynamics. In addition, an essential component of our analysis involves determining the forecasting breakdown point, which is the smallest possible amount of training data our models need to predict future, unseen data accurately. We employ synthetically created noisy data to simulate real-world observational limitations. Our findings indicate that the UDE model is much more data efficient, needing only 20% of data for a correct forecast, whereas the Neural ODE requires 90%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRQC quantum models outperform classical ones in high-frequency functions but are limited by quantum hardware scalability; this paper aims to bring those advantages to classical models without quantum hardware.

Method: Introduce the mathematical paradigm of DRQC into classical models by proposing Q-RUN to retain Fourier-expressive benefits.

Result: Q-RUN shows superior performance in data and predictive modeling, reducing parameters and cutting error by 1-3 orders of magnitude on some tasks while serving as a drop-in replacement for fully connected layers.

Conclusion: Principles from quantum machine learning can inspire more expressive AI designs, making Q-RUN a practical enhancement for various neural architectures.

Abstract: Data re-uploading quantum circuits (DRQC) are a key approach to implementing quantum neural networks and have been shown to outperform classical neural networks in fitting high-frequency functions. However, their practical application is limited by the scalability of current quantum hardware. In this paper, we introduce the mathematical paradigm of DRQC into classical models by proposing a quantum-inspired data re-uploading network (Q-RUN), which retains the Fourier-expressive advantages of quantum models without any quantum hardware. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-RUN delivers superior performance across both data modeling and predictive modeling tasks. Compared to the fully connected layers and the state-of-the-art neural network layers, Q-RUN reduces model parameters while decreasing error by approximately one to three orders of magnitude on certain tasks. Notably, Q-RUN can serve as a drop-in replacement for standard fully connected layers, improving the performance of a wide range of neural architectures. This work illustrates how principles from quantum machine learning can guide the design of more expressive artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: MaskOpt is a large-scale benchmark dataset for deep learning-based IC mask optimization, derived from real 45nm node designs, featuring cell- and context-aware tiles to improve practical applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical lithography challenges with shrinking IC dimensions make OPC and ILT computationally costly. Existing deep learning datasets in mask optimization use synthetic layouts, ignore standard-cell hierarchy, and lack surrounding contexts, limiting real-world use.

Method: Construct MaskOpt dataset using real IC designs at 45nm node, with 104,714 metal-layer and 121,952 via-layer tiles clipped at standard-cell placements to preserve cell info and repeated logic gates. Supports varying context windows to capture neighboring shape effects from optical proximity.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals trade-offs among baselines. Context size analysis and ab studies confirm that surrounding geometries and cell-aware inputs are crucial for accurate mask generation.

Conclusion: MaskOpt advances deep learning for cell- and context-aware mask optimization by providing a realistic, large-scale dataset, highlighting the importance of context and cell info in developing scalable models for practical IC manufacturing.

Abstract: As integrated circuit (IC) dimensions shrink below the lithographic wavelength, optical lithography faces growing challenges from diffraction and process variability. Model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) and inverse lithography technique (ILT) remain indispensable but computationally expensive, requiring repeated simulations that limit scalability. Although deep learning has been applied to mask optimization, existing datasets often rely on synthetic layouts, disregard standard-cell hierarchy, and neglect the surrounding contexts around the mask optimization targets, thereby constraining their applicability to practical mask optimization. To advance deep learning for cell- and context-aware mask optimization, we present MaskOpt, a large-scale benchmark dataset constructed from real IC designs at the 45$\mathrm{nm}$ node. MaskOpt includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles. Each tile is clipped at a standard-cell placement to preserve cell information, exploiting repeated logic gate occurrences. Different context window sizes are supported in MaskOpt to capture the influence of neighboring shapes from optical proximity effects. We evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models for IC mask optimization to build up benchmarks, and the evaluation results expose distinct trade-offs across baseline models. Further context size analysis and input ablation studies confirm the importance of both surrounding geometries and cell-aware inputs in achieving accurate mask generation.

*Matthew Thompson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dual-state architecture to separate deterministic workflow control from stochastic LLM generation, using atomic action pairs and guard functions to improve AI coding agent reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI coding agents are prone to stochastic failures like gaming unit tests or hallucinating syntax due to mixing LLM decision-making with deterministic processes, necessitating a clear separation inspired by software engineering practices.

Method: The paper introduces a Dual-State Architecture separating workflow state (deterministic control flow) and environment state (stochastic LLM generation), Atomic Action Pairs for indivisible generation-verification transactions, and Guard Functions to project outputs onto observable workflow state.

Result: The framework was validated on three code generation tasks across 13 LLMs (1.3B–15B parameters). For qualified models, task success rates improved by up to 66 percentage points with 1.2–2.1× baseline computational cost.

Conclusion: Architectural constraints can substitute for parameter scale in achieving reliable code generation, enabling more dependable AI coding agents by preserving LLM creativity while using deterministic control for decision-making.

Abstract: Current approaches to AI coding agents appear to blur the lines between the Large Language Model (LLM) and the agent itself, asking the LLM to make decisions best left to deterministic processes. This leads to systems prone to stochastic failures such as gaming unit tests or hallucinating syntax. Drawing on established software engineering practices that provide deterministic frameworks for managing unpredictable processes, this paper proposes setting the control boundary such that the LLM is treated as a component of the environment environment -- preserving its creative stochasticity -- rather than the decision-making agent.
  A \textbf{Dual-State Architecture} is formalized, separating workflow state (deterministic control flow) from environment state (stochastic generation). \textbf{Atomic Action Pairs} couple generation with verification as indivisible transactions, where \textbf{Guard Functions} act as sensing actions that project probabilistic outputs onto observable workflow state. The framework is validated on three code generation tasks across 13 LLMs (1.3B--15B parameters). For qualified instruction-following models, task success rates improved by up to 66 percentage points at 1.2--2.1$\times$ baseline computational cost. The results suggest that architectural constraints can substitute for parameter scale in achieving reliable code generation.

*Hayeon Jeong,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Text-to-image diffusion models struggle with multi-concept prompts due to a Dominant-vs-Dominated imbalance, where one concept suppresses others, analyzed through DominanceBench from data and architecture angles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue in text-to-image diffusion models where generating from multi-concept prompts leads to one concept dominating and suppressing others, hindering diverse and controllable generation.

Method: Introduce DominanceBench to systematically analyze the imbalance, examining causes from data (limited instance diversity) and architectural perspectives (cross-attention dynamics, head ablation studies).

Result: Limited training data diversity worsens inter-concept interference, dominant tokens saturate attention to suppress others across diffusion steps, and the imbalance arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into generative collapse, advancing toward more reliable and controllable text-to-image generation by addressing the Dominant-vs-Dominated imbalance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have drawn significant attention for their ability to generate diverse and high-fidelity images. However, when generating from multi-concept prompts, one concept token often dominates the generation, suppressing the others-a phenomenon we term the Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance. To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps. In addition, head ablation studies show that the DvD behavior arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads. Our findings provide key insights into generative collapse, advancing toward more reliable and controllable text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: Forward-only algorithm FOTON for neural network training, equivalent to backpropagation under linear/orthogonal assumptions, enabling deep networks without backward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exponential growth in neural architectures makes backpropagation computationally costly; existing forward-only alternatives like PEPITA fail to scale beyond a few layers, limiting their use.

Method: Theoretical analysis of PEPITA and forward-only frameworks to design a forward-only algorithm that matches backpropagation under linear/orthogonal assumptions; relaxing linear assumption leads to FOTON, which bridges gaps with backpropagation.

Result: FOTON outperforms PEPITA, allowing training of neural networks of any depth without backward passes; it shows promise in convolutional networks, opening avenues for advanced architectures.

Conclusion: FOTON provides a scalable and efficient forward-only alternative to backpropagation, with open-sourced code, enabling deeper networks and potential applications in modern architectures like CNNs.

Abstract: Backpropagation is still the de facto algorithm used today to
  train neural networks.
  With the exponential growth of recent architectures, the
  computational cost of this algorithm also becomes a burden. The
  recent PEPITA and forward-only frameworks have proposed promising
  alternatives, but they failed to scale up to a handful of hidden
  layers, yet limiting their use.
  In this paper, we first analyze theoretically the main limitations of
  these approaches. It allows us the design of a forward-only
  algorithm, which is equivalent to backpropagation under the linear
  and orthogonal assumptions. By relaxing the linear assumption, we
  then introduce FOTON (Forward-Only Training of Orthogonal Networks)
  that bridges the gap with the backpropagation
  algorithm. Experimental results show that it outperforms PEPITA,
  enabling us to train neural networks of any depth, without the need
  for a backward pass.
  Moreover its performance on convolutional networks clearly opens up avenues for its application to more
  advanced architectures. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/p0lcAi/FOTON .

*Alexandre Cabodevila,Pedro Gamallo-Fernandez,Juan C. Vidal,Manuel Lama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) architecture to generate realistic synthetic clinical records for cardiac rehabilitation, aiming to enhance cardiac risk prediction models and reduce reliance on hazardous diagnostic tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiac rehabilitation involves complex clinical processes, but real-world medical databases face issues like scarce data, unsuitable records for analysis, and high prevalence of missing values, hindering effective modeling and prediction.

Method: The work proposes an architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to synthesize realistic clinical records that are coherent with real-world observations, addressing data limitations.

Result: The results show that the proposed architecture generates coherent and realistic synthetic data, improving the accuracy of classifiers for cardiac risk detection and outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for synthetic data generation.

Conclusion: The CVAE-based approach effectively mitigates data limitations in cardiac rehabilitation by enhancing dataset size and diversity, improving prediction models, and reducing the need for hazardous diagnostic procedures like exercise stress testing.

Abstract: Cardiac rehabilitation constitutes a structured clinical process involving multiple interdependent phases, individualized medical decisions, and the coordinated participation of diverse healthcare professionals. This sequential and adaptive nature enables the program to be modeled as a business process, thereby facilitating its analysis. Nevertheless, studies in this context face significant limitations inherent to real-world medical databases: data are often scarce due to both economic costs and the time required for collection; many existing records are not suitable for specific analytical purposes; and, finally, there is a high prevalence of missing values, as not all patients undergo the same diagnostic tests. To address these limitations, this work proposes an architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for the synthesis of realistic clinical records that are coherent with real-world observations. The primary objective is to increase the size and diversity of the available datasets in order to enhance the performance of cardiac risk prediction models and to reduce the need for potentially hazardous diagnostic procedures, such as exercise stress testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating coherent and realistic synthetic data, whose use improves the accuracy of the various classifiers employed for cardiac risk detection, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for synthetic data generation.

### [46] [Disentangling Fact from Sentiment: A Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework for Multimodal Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20670)
*Weilin Zhou,Zonghao Ying,Junjie Mu,Shengwei Tian,Quanchen Zou,Deyue Zhang,Dongdong Yang,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DCCF is a new model for multimodal fake news detection that focuses on amplifying cross-modal contradictions instead of smoothing them, achieving better accuracy than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fake news detection methods over-smooth cross-modal discrepancies, treating crucial evidence of fabrication as noise, which weakens detection performance.

Method: Proposes DCCF with three steps: decoupling inputs into Fact and Sentiment spaces, using physics-inspired feature dynamics to polarize representations, and applying a conflict-consensus mechanism for judgment.

Result: DCCF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three real-world datasets with an average accuracy improvement of 3.52%.

Conclusion: Focusing on inconsistencies rather than consistency improves fake news detection by better capturing fabrication evidence, as demonstrated by DCCF's effectiveness.

Abstract: Prevalent multimodal fake news detection relies on consistency-based fusion, yet this paradigm fundamentally misinterprets critical cross-modal discrepancies as noise, leading to over-smoothing, which dilutes critical evidence of fabrication. Mainstream consistency-based fusion inherently minimizes feature discrepancies to align modalities, yet this approach fundamentally fails because it inadvertently smoothes out the subtle cross-modal contradictions that serve as the primary evidence of fabrication. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts. Finally, a conflict-consensus mechanism standardizes these local discrepancies against the global context for robust deliberative judgment.Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets demonstrate that DCCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 3.52\%.

*Yuanhao Xi,Xiaohuan Bing,Ramin Yahyapour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyDRA introduces a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework with hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling to enhance mobile vision-language models, outperforming baselines without additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile-oriented Vision Language Models (VLMs) face significant computational training challenges, and standard Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with fixed rank is insufficient for training these multimodal models.

Method: HyDRA implements two optimization strategies: hierarchical optimization (coarse-grained rank assignment across layers and fine-grained adjustment within layers) and dynamic adjustment (end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to adjust ranks during fine-tuning).

Result: Experiments on benchmarks show HyDRA consistently outperforms baselines, achieving a 4.7% improvement across various model sizes without increasing trainable parameters, and sometimes surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.

Conclusion: HyDRA effectively addresses the training efficiency and performance limitations of mobile VLMs by enabling flexible and efficient fine-tuning, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have undergone significant advancements, particularly with the emergence of mobile-oriented VLMs, which offer a wide range of application scenarios. However, the substantial computational requirements for training these models present a significant obstacle to their practical application. To address this issue, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. Nevertheless, the standard LoRA with a fixed rank lacks sufficient capability for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities. In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters. In some tasks, it even surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.

*Simon Roy,Samuel Barbeau,Giovanni Beltrame,Christian Desrosiers,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple triplet loss outperforms advanced objectives in VLM-based reward models for generalizable rewards, highlighting data and architecture as key factors in previous claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning generalizable reward functions is crucial for embodied intelligence, with recent methods using contrastive VLMs for unsupervised dense rewards. However, comparisons are hindered by differences in training data, architectures, and evaluation, motivating a unified assessment of learning objectives.

Method: We evaluate recent VLM-based reward models under a unified framework with identical backbones, finetuning data, and evaluation environments. Using Meta-World tasks, accuracy is assessed via consistency with ground truth reward and correlation with expert progress.

Result: The simple triplet loss outperforms state-of-the-art methods, suggesting that improvements in recent approaches may stem from data and architecture differences rather than more complex objectives.

Conclusion: The study isolates the learning objective's impact, revealing that a simpler approach can be more effective, indicating a need to reassess data and architectural contributions in VLM-based reward modeling.

Abstract: Learning generalizable reward functions is a core challenge in embodied intelligence. Recent work leverages contrastive vision language models (VLMs) to obtain dense, domain-agnostic rewards without human supervision. These methods adapt VLMs into reward models through increasingly complex learning objectives, yet meaningful comparison remains difficult due to differences in training data, architectures, and evaluation settings. In this work, we isolate the impact of the learning objective by evaluating recent VLM-based reward models under a unified framework with identical backbones, finetuning data, and evaluation environments. Using Meta-World tasks, we assess modeling accuracy by measuring consistency with ground truth reward and correlation with expert progress. Remarkably, we show that a simple triplet loss outperforms state-of-the-art methods, suggesting that much of the improvements in recent approaches could be attributed to differences in data and architectures.

*Yuma Ichikawa,Naoya Takagi,Takumi Nakagawa,Yuzi Kanazawa,Akira Sakai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHOTON replaces Transformers' horizontal token scanning with a vertical hierarchical approach using bottom-up compression and top-down reconstruction to improve throughput-memory trade-offs, especially for long contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers' sequential scanning increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding memory-bound, as KV-cache overhead dominates inference throughput over computation.

Method: PHOTON uses a hierarchical autoregressive model with latent streams: a bottom-up encoder compresses tokens into low-rate states, and lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations.

Result: PHOTON outperforms Transformer-based models in throughput-quality trade-off, reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic significantly, and achieves up to 10^3x higher throughput per unit memory in long-context and multi-query tasks.

Conclusion: PHOTON's vertical multi-resolution context access offers a more efficient alternative to traditional Transformers, addressing memory bottlenecks and enhancing performance in autoregressive language modeling for extended contexts.

Abstract: Transformers operate as horizontal token-by-token scanners; at each generation step, the model attends to an ever-growing sequence of token-level states. This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. This reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\times$ higher throughput per unit memory.

TL;DR: A computational mechanics benchmark, FEM-Bench, is introduced to evaluate LLMs' ability to generate correct scientific code, showing gaps in solving introductory tasks despite their simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of rigorous benchmarks to assess LLMs' ability to generate scientifically valid physical models, despite their advancing reasoning capabilities. Computational mechanics offers a structured framework for such evaluation due to its mathematical clarity and physical constraints.

Method: Introduces FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark with tasks derived from introductory graduate-level material, evaluating LLMs' ability to generate correct finite element method code through function writing and unit test writing tests.

Result: Best-performing model in function writing (Gemini 3 Pro) completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. Best-performing model in unit test writing (GPT-5) achieved an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other models showed varied performance.

Conclusion: FEM-Bench establishes a structured foundation for evaluating AI-generated scientific code, with future iterations planned to incorporate more sophisticated tasks to track model progress.

Abstract: As LLMs advance their reasoning capabilities about the physical world, the absence of rigorous benchmarks for evaluating their ability to generate scientifically valid physical models has become a critical gap. Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. The best performing model at unit test writing, GPT-5, had an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other popular models showed broad performance variation. FEM-Bench establishes a structured foundation for evaluating AI-generated scientific code, and future iterations will incorporate increasingly sophisticated tasks to track progress as models evolve.

TL;DR: Analysis of Lipschitz properties in multimodal autoencoders to improve stability, with theoretical derivation of Lipschitz constants and a proposed regularized attention-based fusion method validated empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal autoencoders have potential for handling complex data but require better understanding of stability and robustness to optimize training, architecture, and real-world use.

Method: Derive theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods, introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method based on theory, and validate through experiments estimating constants across trials.

Result: Proposed fusion function aligns with theory and outperforms existing strategies in consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy in multimodal autoencoder training.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical foundation for fusion in multimodal autoencoders and a solution for enhancing performance through improved stability and convergence.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of multimodal autoencoders has gained significant attention due to their potential to handle multimodal complex data types and improve model performance. Understanding the stability and robustness of these models is crucial for optimizing their training, architecture, and real-world applicability. This paper presents an analysis of Lipschitz properties in multimodal autoencoders, combining both theoretical insights and empirical validation to enhance the training stability of these models. We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies. Our results demonstrate that our proposed fusion function not only aligns with theoretical predictions but also outperforms existing strategies in terms of consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy. This work provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding fusion in multimodal autoencoders and contributes a solution for enhancing their performance.

*Yizhak Yisrael Elboher,Avraham Raviv,Amihay Elboher,Zhouxing Shi,Omri Azencot,Hillel Kugler,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for verifying the robustness of neural networks with early exits, using formal methods and an optimized algorithm to balance safety, efficiency, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring AI safety and efficiency is crucial; formal verification offers robustness guarantees, and early exits improve inference efficiency, but verifying networks with early exits is challenging due to complex execution paths.

Method: Define a robustness property tailored to early exit architectures and use off-the-shelf solvers for verification. Develop a baseline algorithm with early stopping strategies and heuristic optimizations to maintain soundness and completeness, validated on multiple benchmarks.

Result: The framework is effective, demonstrating performance gains from the improved algorithm. Early exits not only accelerate inference but also enhance verifiability, solving more queries faster than standard networks, while aiding in accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: The work successfully integrates robustness verification with early exit architectures, showing that early exits can improve both efficiency and verifiability, providing practical metrics for balancing accuracy and safety in AI systems.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and efficiency of AI systems is a central goal of modern research. Formal verification provides guarantees of neural network robustness, while early exits improve inference efficiency by enabling intermediate predictions. Yet verifying networks with early exits introduces new challenges due to their conditional execution paths. In this work, we define a robustness property tailored to early exit architectures and show how off-the-shelf solvers can be used to assess it. We present a baseline algorithm, enhanced with an early stopping strategy and heuristic optimizations that maintain soundness and completeness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks validate our framework's effectiveness and demonstrate the performance gains of the improved algorithm. Alongside the natural inference acceleration provided by early exits, we show that they also enhance verifiability, enabling more queries to be solved in less time compared to standard networks. Together with a robustness analysis, we show how these metrics can help users navigate the inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

*Brian Lu,Hongyu Zhao,Shuo Sun,Hao Peng,Rui Ding,Hongyuan Mei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR enhances generalization in LLMs for causal reasoning tasks more effectively than SFT, but only under specific conditions of model scale and initial reasoning competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically investigate the conditions under which Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) yields robust generalization in large language models for complex reasoning tasks, specifically in probabilistic inference over causal graphical models.

Method: Construct datasets of causal graphs and queries across associational, interventional, and counterfactual levels, and structural complexity measured by subgraph size. Fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models (scales 3B-32B) using RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), varying training query levels.

Result: RLVR provides stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific model sizes and training query level combinations. Effectiveness depends on initial reasoning competence; with sufficient competence, RLVR improves marginalization strategy and reduces intermediate probability errors, yielding accuracy gains on complex queries.

Conclusion: RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills in LLMs, but its benefits only emerge when the model has sufficient initial competence, highlighting the importance of conditional application based on model capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.

*Marcel Meyer,Sascha Kaltenpoth,Kevin Zalipski,Henrik Albers,Oliver Müller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TS-Arena is a platform to evaluate Time Series Foundation Models fairly by preventing data leakage from historical training data to test sets, using live data streams and a pre-registration mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of Time Series Foundation Models are flawed due to information leakage where training and test sets overlap, and global patterns are illegitimately transferred, compromising benchmarking validity.

Method: TS-Arena restores integrity by treating the unknown future as the test environment, implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams to ensure evaluation targets are physically non-existent during inference, enforcing a strict global temporal split with a moving frontier.

Result: A prototype of TS-Arena has been developed and applied in the energy sector, providing a sustainable infrastructure for comparing foundation models under real-world constraints, accessible online.

Conclusion: TS-Arena addresses the evaluation crisis in Time Series Foundation Models by preventing historical contamination and enabling authentic assessment of model generalization through real-world, future-focused testing.

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer transformative capabilities for forecasting, they simultaneously risk triggering a fundamental evaluation crisis. This crisis is driven by information leakage due to overlapping training and test sets across different models, as well as the illegitimate transfer of global patterns to test data. While the ability to learn shared temporal dynamics represents a primary strength of these models, their evaluation on historical archives often permits the exploitation of observed global shocks, which violates the independence required for valid benchmarking. We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split. This methodology establishes a moving temporal frontier that prevents historical contamination and provides an authentic assessment of model generalization. Initially applied within the energy sector, TS-Arena provides a sustainable infrastructure for comparing foundation models under real-world constraints. A prototype of the platform is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/DAG-UPB/TS-Arena.

TL;DR: The paper introduces subgroup discovery methods for survival analysis using Cox models, with novel metrics (EPE and CRS) and algorithms, validated on synthetic/real data and a NASA case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quality functions for subgroup discovery are insufficient for Cox survival models, limiting accurate and interpretable subgroup identification.

Method: Proposes eight algorithms for subgroup discovery, including one combining expected prediction entropy (EPE) and conditional rank statistics (CRS), evaluated on synthetic/real datasets.

Result: Algorithms recover ground-truth subgroups in controlled scenarios and improve model fit compared to naive whole-dataset Cox modeling in practical applications.

Conclusion: The innovations in metrics and algorithms effectively address the subgroup discovery problem for Cox models, showing practical utility in real-world data like NASA jet engine simulations.

Abstract: We study the problem of subgroup discovery for survival analysis, where the goal is to find an interpretable subset of the data on which a Cox model is highly accurate. Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.
  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a "quality function" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.
  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA. The discovered subgroups uncover known nonlinearities/homogeneity in the data, and which suggest design choices which have been mirrored in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models offer high accuracy but lack interpretability. Symbolic regression provides interpretable equations from data, combining neural network advancements for better insights in scientific applications.

Method: Applied the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Compared results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods.

Result: SEGVAE achieves outcomes comparable or identical to graph neural networks for defect properties in 2D materials, demonstrating effective symbolic modeling.

Conclusion: The SEGVAE method is applicable in natural sciences, offering interpretable and generalizable models that rival advanced neural networks in predicting material properties.

Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.

*Miguel Esparza,Vamshi Battal,Ali Mostafavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual-specialist ensemble framework (GNN for environmental contagion, XGBoost for structural fragility) improves wildfire risk modeling in urban areas by capturing non-linear contagion dynamics, validated on the 2025 Eaton Fire to inform targeted mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wildfire risk models treat structures as isolated assets, failing to capture non-linear contagion dynamics in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), necessitating a bridge between mechanistic physics and data-driven learning for accurate urban conflagration prediction.

Method: Develop a dual-specialist ensemble framework: an environmental specialist using a graph neural network (GNN) to model community contagion via physics-informed probabilities and high-dimensional embeddings, and a structural specialist using XGBoost for asset-level resilience analysis, integrated through logistic stacking for classification.

Result: Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the GNN showed neighborhood-scale environmental pressure dominates structural features in propagation pathways, while XGBoost identified eaves as the primary micro-scale ingress vector; the ensemble achieved robust classification and generated a diagnostic risk topology.

Conclusion: The framework enables data-driven decision-making for community resilience by moving beyond binary loss prediction to prioritize targeted mitigation: vegetation management for high-connectivity clusters and structural hardening for vulnerable nodes, operationalizing a proactive approach to wildfire risk reduction.

Abstract: As wildfires increasingly evolve into urban conflagrations, traditional risk models that treat structures as isolated assets fail to capture the non-linear contagion dynamics characteristic of the wildland urban interface (WUI). This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology. This capability empowers decision makers to move beyond binary loss prediction and precisely target mitigation prioritizing vegetation management for high connectivity clusters and structural hardening for architecturally vulnerable nodes thereby operationalizing a proactive, data driven approach to community resilience.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize bandwidth and privacy in federated learning by reducing uplink communication costs while preventing gradient inversion attacks.

Method: Encodes high-dimensional gradients via directional derivatives along multiple random vectors, reducing message size; server decodes by projecting back.

Result: Achieves O(1/√K) convergence rate (matching FedSGD), reduces communication from O(d) to O(m) where m≪d, and provides inherent privacy with a tuneable trade-off.

Conclusion: FedMPDD is effective for efficient and private federated learning, validated by theoretical analysis and experiments.

Abstract: This paper introduces \texttt{FedMPDD} (\textbf{Fed}erated Learning via \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{P}rojected \textbf{D}irectional \textbf{D}erivatives), a novel algorithm that simultaneously optimizes bandwidth utilization and enhances privacy in Federated Learning. The core idea of \texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing that \texttt{FedMPDD} converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$, matching the performance of FedSGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method provides some inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks due to the geometric properties of low-rank projections, offering a tunable privacy-utility trade-off controlled by the number of projections. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate our theory and demonstrates our results.

*Mohammad Meymani,Roozbeh Razavi-Far*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A paper proposes an adversarial training defense system using a mixture-of-experts architecture with ResNet-18 backbones to enhance robustness against adversarial threats, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial threats like perturbations, poisoning, and query attacks, which can cause misclassification or steal information, necessitating robust defense mechanisms.

Method: Uses adversarial training within a mixture-of-experts architecture with nine pre-trained experts based on ResNet-18, jointly updating expert parameters and gating mechanism through end-to-end training.

Result: The proposed defense system outperforms state-of-the-art defense systems and plain classifiers, even those with more complex architectures than ResNet-18.

Conclusion: The mixture-of-experts architecture with adversarial training effectively enhances model robustness, demonstrating superior performance against adversarial threats.

Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful tool enabling full automation of a huge number of tasks without explicit programming. Despite recent progress of machine learning in different domains, these models have shown vulnerabilities when they are exposed to adversarial threats. Adversarial threats aim to hinder the machine learning models from satisfying their objectives. They can create adversarial perturbations, which are imperceptible to humans' eyes but have the ability to cause misclassification during inference. Moreover, they can poison the training data to harm the model's performance or they can query the model to steal its sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a defense system, which devises an adversarial training module within mixture-of-experts architecture to enhance its robustness against adversarial threats. In our proposed defense system, we use nine pre-trained experts with ResNet-18 as their backbone. During end-to-end training, the parameters of expert models and gating mechanism are jointly updated allowing further optimization of the experts. Our proposed defense system outperforms state-of-the-art defense systems and plain classifiers, which use a more complex architecture than our model's backbone.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLR compression methods like Monarch and BLAST improve efficiency and reduce model size but face memory-bound issues in multi-token inference. Custom Triton kernels with optimizations achieve up to 3.76x speedups and 3x compression over PyTorch baselines on constrained GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models are growing in size, making single-GPU deployment difficult due to computational and memory costs. BLR compression helps but practical multi-token inference becomes memory-bound, limiting latency improvements.

Method: Used roofline analysis to identify memory bottlenecks. Developed custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for Monarch and BLR Accelerated Structure-aware Transformers (BLAST) to enhance performance.

Result: On memory-constrained GPUs (Jetson Orin Nano, A40), kernels achieved up to 3.76x speedups and 3x model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines with CUDA backend and compiler optimizations, tested on models like Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

Conclusion: Custom optimized kernels effectively address memory-bound issues in BLR methods, enabling significant speedups and compression for practical deployment of large transformer models on resource-limited hardware.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based foundation models have made them the default choice for many tasks, but their rapidly growing size makes fitting a full model on a single GPU increasingly difficult and their computational cost prohibitive. Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\times$ speedups and $3\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

TL;DR: Formal poisoning robustness certification framework using barrier certificates, scenario convex programming, and PAC bounds to certify safety under ℓp-norm bounded poisoning attacks, with model-agnostic certification for both training and test-time attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning's increasing use in safety-critical domains heightens risks from adversarial threats, especially data poisoning attacks that corrupt training data. Existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about model class, attack type, poisoning extent, or point-wise certification, limiting practical reliability.

Method: The paper introduces a formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. Using barrier certificates adapted from control theory, sufficient conditions are derived to certify a robust radius ensuring terminal model safety under worst-case ℓp-norm based poisoning. Barrier certificates are parameterized as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. Probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds are derived by solving a scenario convex program, yielding confidence lower bounds on the certified robustness radius.

Result: Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate the approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level. The framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework providing formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings.

Conclusion: The paper presents a unified framework for formal poisoning robustness certification for machine learning models, applicable to both training-time and test-time attacks. The approach, leveraging barrier certificates and scenario convex programming, provides probably approximately correct (PAC) certified robustness radii in ℓp-norm bounded poisoning settings, and is model-agnostic, requiring no prior knowledge of attack or contamination level.

Abstract: The increasing use of machine learning in safety-critical domains amplifies the risk of adversarial threats, especially data poisoning attacks that corrupt training data to degrade performance or induce unsafe behavior. Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 show that our approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FlowKANet, a model using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for flow delay prediction in communication networks, achieving efficiency and transparency through a neural-symbolic approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of flow delay is crucial for optimizing modern communication networks, requiring efficient and transparent models.

Method: The authors implement a heterogeneous GNN baseline, propose FlowKANet with KAN layers and KAMP-Attn for reduced parameters, and distill it into symbolic surrogate models via block-wise regression.

Result: KAN layers provide a favorable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, while symbolic surrogates enable lightweight deployment and enhanced transparency.

Conclusion: FlowKANet demonstrates the potential of KANs in graph-based tasks, balancing performance with interpretability for network optimization.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of flow delay is essential for optimizing and managing modern communication networks. We investigate three levels of modeling for this task. First, we implement a heterogeneous GNN with attention-based message passing, establishing a strong neural baseline. Second, we propose FlowKANet in which Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks replace standard MLP layers, reducing trainable parameters while maintaining competitive predictive performance. FlowKANet integrates KAMP-Attn (Kolmogorov-Arnold Message Passing with Attention), embedding KAN operators directly into message-passing and attention computation. Finally, we distill the model into symbolic surrogate models using block-wise regression, producing closed-form equations that eliminate trainable weights while preserving graph-structured dependencies. The results show that KAN layers provide a favorable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy and that symbolic surrogates emphasize the potential for lightweight deployment and enhanced transparency.

### [65] [DiEC: Diffusion Embedded Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20905)
*Haidong Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiEC is a deep clustering method that uses pretrained diffusion model activations to find optimal representation points across layers and timesteps for improved clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: We address the limitation of using a single fixed encoder in deep clustering by leveraging the varying clusterability of representation trajectories in diffusion models across different network hierarchies and noise timesteps.

Method: Propose DiEC, which performs a two-stage two-dimensional search (layer × timestep) to find the optimal representation point: first fix the bottleneck layer, then apply Optimal Timestep Search. Extract features with lightweight residual mapping, optimize a KL self-training objective with adaptive and entropy regularization, and add a denoising-consistency branch for stability.

Result: Experiments show DiEC achieves competitive clustering performance on multiple standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiEC effectively harnesses the representation trajectory of pretrained diffusion models for unsupervised clustering, with practical extensions like regularization and generative consistency.

Abstract: Deep clustering hinges on learning representations that are inherently clusterable. However, using a single encoder to produce a fixed embedding ignores the representation trajectory formed by a pretrained diffusion model across network hierarchies and noise timesteps, where clusterability varies substantially. We propose DiEC (Diffusion Embedded Clustering), which performs unsupervised clustering by directly reading internal activations from a pretrained diffusion U-Net.
  DiEC formulates representation selection as a two-dimensional search over layer x timestep, and exploits a weak-coupling property to decompose it into two stages. Specifically, we first fix the U-Net bottleneck layer as the Clustering-friendly Middle Layer (CML), and then use Optimal Timestep Search (OTS) to identify the clustering-optimal timestep (t*). During training, we extract bottleneck features at the fixed t* and obtain clustering representations via a lightweight residual mapping. We optimize a DEC-style KL self-training objective, augmented with adaptive graph regularization and entropy regularization to strengthen cluster structures. In parallel, we introduce a denoising-consistency branch at random timesteps to stabilize the representations and preserve generative consistency. Experiments show that DiEC achieves competitive clustering performance on multiple standard benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting and understanding the computational hardness of combinatorial optimization problems on graphs, enabling better algorithm selection and performance insights.

Method: A two-stage framework: first, create a dataset with graph features and hardness labels, train ML classification models; second, explain predictions via association rule mining (e.g., FP-Growth) and train regression models to predict computation times.

Best association rule had 0.8829 support for hard instances and 87.64% accuracy. Regression model predicted computation times with 5.12% RMSE and R2 of 0.991.

Conclusion: GCO-HPIF effectively predicts and explains hardness, showcasing strong predictive accuracy and interpretability with minimal features, making it valuable for optimization problem analysis.

Abstract: This study introduces GCO-HPIF, a general machine-learning-based framework to predict and explain the computational hardness of combinatorial optimization problems that can be represented on graphs. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a dataset is created comprising problem-agnostic graph features and hardness classifications of problem instances. Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times. The GCO-HPIF framework was applied to a dataset of 3287 maximum clique problem instances compiled from the COLLAB, IMDB, and TWITTER graph datasets using five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely three exact branch-and-bound-based algorithms (Gurobi, CliSAT, and MOMC) and two graph-neural-network-based algorithms (EGN and HGS). The framework demonstrated excellent performance in predicting instance hardness, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.9921, a minority-class F1 score of 0.878, and an ROC-AUC score of 0.9083 using only three graph features. The best association rule found by the FP-Growth algorithm for explaining the hardness predictions had a support of 0.8829 for hard instances and an overall accuracy of 87.64 percent, underscoring the framework's usefulness for both prediction and explanation. Furthermore, the best-performing regression model for predicting computation times achieved a percentage RMSE of 5.12 and an R2 value of 0.991.

*Ningyuan Liu,Jing Yang,Kaitong Cai,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RevFFN enables memory-efficient full parameter fine-tuning of Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs on a single GPU by using reversible Transformer blocks that reconstruct activations during backpropagation, reducing memory overhead without needing distributed systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full parameter fine-tuning of large language models requires caching extensive intermediate activations for backpropagation, causing high memory usage. Distributed frameworks like DeepSpeed help but need extra hardware and slow training. MoE LLMs exacerbate this issue.

Method: Introduces RevFFN, which applies carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks to MoE LLMs. These blocks allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory.

Result: RevFFN significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine-tuning while preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures. This enables efficient fine-tuning on a single consumer-grade or server-grade GPU.

Conclusion: RevFFN provides a practical solution for memory-efficient fine-tuning of large-scale MoE LLMs, making full parameter adaptation feasible on standard GPUs without compromising performance or requiring extensive distributed resources.

Abstract: Full parameter fine tuning is a key technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but it incurs substantial memory overhead due to the need to cache extensive intermediate activations for backpropagation. This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.

Conclusion: The paper presents a dynamic, guardrailed subscription pricing framework that blends demand forecasting, elasticity modeling, and churn prediction to optimize revenue while maintaining business constraints. The system outperforms traditional static pricing models, enables real-time recalibration, and provides both technical and managerial guidance for implementing ethical dynamic pricing strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents a marketing analytics framework that operationalizes subscription pricing as a dynamic, guardrailed decision system, uniting multivariate demand forecasting, segment-level price elasticity, and churn propensity to optimize revenue, margin, and retention. The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study investigates how training data size affects the accuracy of a GNN-based surrogate model for aerodynamic field prediction, using a new open-source multi-fidelity dataset for double-delta wings. It finds a power-law relationship with an exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data use, and estimates optimal sampling density and trade-offs in dataset and model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source multi-fidelity datasets and clear guidelines on dataset size versus model performance are lacking in data-driven surrogate models for vehicle design, hindering practical adoption and optimization.

Method: The study releases an open-source dataset of 2448 aerodynamic flow snapshots from VLM and RANS solvers across 272 double-delta wing geometries. It conducts an empirical scaling analysis by training the MF-VortexNet GNN model on six datasets (40 to 1280 snapshots) with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed budget.

Result: Test error decreases with data size following a power-law exponent of -0.6122, showing efficient data utilization. Optimal sampling density is estimated at about eight samples per dimension in a design space, with larger models using data more efficiently, suggesting trade-offs in dataset generation and training costs.

Conclusion: The research provides empirical insights and an open-source dataset to guide surrogate model design, emphasizing efficient data scaling and potential cost-benefit balances between dataset expansion and model complexity for aerodynamic applications.

Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models are increasingly adopted to accelerate vehicle design. However, open-source multi-fidelity datasets and empirical guidelines linking dataset size to model performance remain limited. This study investigates the relationship between training data size and prediction accuracy for a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate model for aerodynamic field prediction. We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The geometries are generated using a nested Saltelli sampling scheme to support future dataset expansion and variance-based sensitivity analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization. Based on this scaling law, we estimate that the optimal sampling density is approximately eight samples per dimension in a d-dimensional design space. The results also suggest improved data utilization efficiency for larger surrogate models, implying a potential trade-off between dataset generation cost and model training budget.

Conclusion: The operator learning framework is a flexible and effective approach for solving functional renormalization group equations, offering improved performance and applicability to more complex field studies compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: We present an operator learning framework for solving non-perturbative functional renormalization group equations, which are integro-differential equations defined on functionals. Our proposed approach uses Gaussian process operator learning to construct a flexible functional representation formulated directly on function space, making it independent of a particular equation or discretization. Our method is flexible, and can apply to a broad range of functional differential equations while still allowing for the incorporation of physical priors in either the prior mean or the kernel design. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several relevant equations, such as the Wetterich and Wilson--Polchinski equations, showing that it achieves equal or better performance than existing approximations such as the local-potential approximation, while being significantly more flexible. In particular, our method can handle non-constant fields, making it promising for the study of more complex field configurations, such as instantons.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReACT-Drug is a target-agnostic RL framework for de novo drug design that uses protein embeddings to bias fragment-based search and PPO-guided reaction transformations to generate valid, novel candidates with good binding affinities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: De novo drug design faces challenges in navigating the vast chemical space to find synthetically accessible, high-affinity candidates. Traditional supervised learning methods lack capabilities for multi-objective optimization and exploration of novel chemical space, which reinforcement learning can address.

Method: The framework uses ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins from a knowledge base (e.g., PDB), decomposes known drug ligands of those proteins into fragments to initialize a fragment-based search space, and employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent guiding a ChemBERTa-encoded molecule through a dynamic action space of chemically valid, reaction-template-based transformations.

Result: The pipeline generates de novo drug candidates with competitive binding affinities and high synthetic accessibility, ensuring 100% chemical validity and novelty as per MOSES benchmarking.

Conclusion: The proposed ReACT-Drug framework demonstrates a promising integration of structural biology, deep representation learning, and chemical synthesis rules to automate and accelerate rational drug design, highlighting its potential for efficient de novo drug candidate generation.

Abstract: De novo drug design is a crucial component of modern drug development, yet navigating the vast chemical space to find synthetically accessible, high-affinity candidates remains a significant challenge. Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhances this process by enabling multi-objective optimization and exploration of novel chemical space - capabilities that traditional supervised learning methods lack. In this work, we introduce \textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces. For each such fragment, the pipeline employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent guiding a ChemBERTa-encoded molecule through a dynamic action space of chemically valid, reaction-template-based transformations. This results in the generation of \textit{de novo} drug candidates with competitive binding affinities and high synthetic accessibility, while ensuring 100\% chemical validity and novelty as per MOSES benchmarking. This architecture highlights the potential of integrating structural biology, deep representation learning, and chemical synthesis rules to automate and accelerate rational drug design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advancements in large language models have automated data science workflows, but it remains unclear if these AI systems can match human data scientists who utilize domain-specific knowledge.

Method: The authors design a prediction task where a key latent variable is hidden in relevant image data rather than tabular features, using a synthetic dataset for property insurance.

Result: Experiments reveal that agentic AI relying on generic analytics workflows underperforms compared to human experts who identify the hidden variable using domain knowledge.

Conclusion: The study highlights a key limitation in current agentic AI for data science and emphasizes the need for future research to develop AI systems that can better recognize and leverage domain-specific insights.

Abstract: Data science plays a critical role in transforming complex data into actionable insights across numerous domains. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes memorization vs. generalization in diffusion models through representation learning, distinguishing between "spiky" memorization and "balanced" generalization representations, validates findings on real-world models, and proposes tools for detection and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models can memorize training data when overfit, risking lack of novelty; understanding the representation-level differences between memorization and generalization is needed to improve generative modeling.

Method: The study investigates a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE) theoretically, then validates on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, and proposes representation-based detection and training-free editing techniques.

Result: Memorization corresponds to localized "spiky" representations storing raw samples, while generalization produces "balanced" representations capturing local statistics; these structures are confirmed in deep diffusion models, enabling detection and control methods.

Conclusion: Learning good representations is central to meaningful generative modeling, as demonstrated by the analysis and tools for mitigating memorization and enhancing generalization in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse samples, yet they risk memorizing training data when overfit to the training objective. We analyze the distinctions between memorization and generalization in diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. By investigating a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE), we prove that (i) memorization corresponds to the model storing raw training samples in the learned weights for encoding and decoding, yielding localized "spiky" representations, whereas (ii) generalization arises when the model captures local data statistics, producing "balanced" representations. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications. Building on these insights, we propose a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique that allows precise control via representation steering. Together, our results highlight that learning good representations is central to novel and meaningful generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLiBRL is a novel deep Bayesian Reinforcement Learning method that improves model learning efficiency and accuracy, outperforming existing methods on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical BRL methods assume known transition and reward models, limiting real-world applicability, while recent deep BRL methods using ELBO optimization can lead to indistinctive task parameters and compromised policies.

Method: Introduces GLiBRL, which uses Generalised Linear Models with learnable basis functions for efficient and accurate learning of transition and reward models, with fully tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference on task parameters and model noises.

Result: On MetaWorld ML10/45 benchmarks, GLiBRL improves VariBAD's success rate by up to 2.7x and shows low-variance, consistent performance compared to other deep BRL/Meta-RL methods like MAML, RL2, SDVT, TrMRL, and ECET.

Conclusion: GLiBRL addresses the limitations of previous BRL methods by providing a tractable and efficient approach, enhancing policy performance in complex environments.

Abstract: Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (BRL) provides a framework for generalisation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems from its use of Bayesian task parameters in the transition and reward models. However, classical BRL methods assume known forms of transition and reward models, reducing their applicability in real-world problems. As a result, recent deep BRL methods have started to incorporate model learning, though the use of neural networks directly on the joint data and task parameters requires optimising the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). ELBOs are difficult to optimise and may result in indistinctive task parameters, hence compromised BRL policies. To this end, we introduce a novel deep BRL method, Generalised Linear Models in Deep Bayesian RL with Learnable Basis Functions (GLiBRL), that enables efficient and accurate learning of transition and reward models, with fully tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference on task parameters and model noises. On challenging MetaWorld ML10/45 benchmarks, GLiBRL improves the success rate of one of the state-of-the-art deep BRL methods, VariBAD, by up to 2.7x. Comparing against representative or recent deep BRL / Meta-RL methods, such as MAML, RL2, SDVT, TrMRL and ECET, GLiBRL also demonstrates its low-variance and decent performance consistently.

TL;DR: CoSeNet is a novel four-layer network model for optimal identification of correlated segments in noisy correlation matrices, outperforming previous approaches through overlapping techniques and pre-trained ML algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately identifying correlated segments in noisy correlation matrices, which is crucial for applications requiring efficient and robust segmentation.

Method: CoSeNet uses a four-layer architecture (input, formatting, re-scaling, segmentation) with overlapping techniques and pre-trained ML algorithms. It optimizes re-scaling parameters via a heuristic algorithm and a Window Difference-based fitness metric.

Result: The model effectively identifies correlated segments, producing a binary noise-free matrix with segmentation points, offering compromise solutions in efficiency, memory, and deployment speed.

Conclusion: CoSeNet provides a robust and generalizable approach for segmentation in noisy correlation matrices, enhancing performance over prior methods and enabling versatile applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the optimal identification of correlated segments in noisy correlation matrices. The proposed model is known as CoSeNet (Correlation Seg-mentation Network) and is based on a four-layer algorithmic architecture that includes several processing layers: input, formatting, re-scaling, and segmentation layer. The proposed model can effectively identify correlated segments in such matrices, better than previous approaches for similar problems. Internally, the proposed model utilizes an overlapping technique and uses pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which makes it robust and generalizable. CoSeNet approach also includes a method that optimizes the parameters of the re-scaling layer using a heuristic algorithm and fitness based on a Window Difference-based metric. The output of the model is a binary noise-free matrix representing optimal segmentation as well as its seg-mentation points and can be used in a variety of applications, obtaining compromise solutions between efficiency, memory, and speed of the proposed deployment model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework to replace static scoring in LLM evaluation, simulating multi-round contests with dynamic pairing, Monte Carlo simulation for Expected Win Score, and Failure Sensitivity Analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLMs use fragmented, task-specific metrics and static scoring, lacking holistic ranking, proper benchmark mix, and dynamic competitive fitness or vulnerability assessment in sequential tasks.

Method: CSD framework with multi-round sequential contests, dynamic model pairing based on win-loss records, Monte Carlo simulation (100,000 iterations) for Expected Win Score, and Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing elimination quantity.

Result: CSD provides a more nuanced, context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, capturing models' risk profiles and competitive dynamics.

Conclusion: CSD represents a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation, addressing limitations of current methods by offering a holistic competitive ranking system.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse specialized benchmarks necessitates a shift from fragmented, task-specific metrics to a holistic, competitive ranking system that effectively aggregates performance across multiple ability dimensions. Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.

### [77] [Understanding Scaling Laws in Deep Neural Networks via Feature Learning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21075)
*Zihan Yao,Ruoyu Wu,Tianxiang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NFD addresses scaling law breakdown in deep ResNets, proposing depth-aware learning-rate correction to maintain depth-wise hyperparameter transfer and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large models like deep ResNets show training instability despite scaling laws, with depth-muP failing for multi-layer blocks; no rigorous theory exists for feature learning at large depth.

Method: Derives Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets in infinite-width/depth limits, analyzes vanishing gradients with 1/sqrt(depth) scaling, and tests two-layer blocks to explain depth-muP failure.

Result: NFD identifies conditions for scaling-law persistence, reveals vanishing mechanism that validates gradient independence at infinite depth, and depth-aware learning-rate correction restores hyperparameter transfer.

Conclusion: NFD provides analytic framework for feature learning in deep networks, explaining failure mechanisms and offering practical fix via learning-rate adjustments to scale successfully.

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to scaling laws that predict consistent gains as model, data, and compute grow; however, large models can exhibit training instability and diminishing returns, suggesting that scaling laws describe what success looks like but not when and why scaling succeeds or fails. A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets.

Motivation: To meet prediction demands of cloud native backend systems operating under highly dynamic loads, coupled metrics, and parallel tasks in complex environments with resource contention, link interactions, and service topology changes.

Method: Builds shared encoding structure for diverse monitoring indicators, employs state fusion mechanism for multi-scale trend changes, introduces cross-task structural propagation module to model dependencies among nodes, and incorporates dynamic adjustment mechanism for non-stationary behaviors.

Result: Superior performance on several error metrics, more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions, and effectiveness verified through hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion: The unified forecasting framework provides reliable predictive capability for high-dimensional, multi-task, strongly dynamic environments in cloud native systems, offering essential technical support for intelligent backend management.

Abstract: This study proposes a unified forecasting framework for high-dimensional multi-task time series to meet the prediction demands of cloud native backend systems operating under highly dynamic loads, coupled metrics, and parallel tasks. The method builds a shared encoding structure to represent diverse monitoring indicators in a unified manner and employs a state fusion mechanism to capture trend changes and local disturbances across different time scales. A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions. Overall, the unified forecasting framework offers reliable predictive capability for high-dimensional, multi-task, and strongly dynamic environments in cloud native systems and provides essential technical support for intelligent backend management.

*Gregory Duthé,Nikolaos Evangelou,Wei Liu,Ioannis G. Kevrekidis,Eleni Chatzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers' representational power for dynamical systems is constrained by softmax convexity for linear systems but can adaptively reconstruct states for nonlinear systems under partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the representational capabilities and limitations of Transformers for dynamical systems, bridging the gap between empirical observations and classical dynamical systems theory, especially as Transformers are increasingly used for time-series forecasting.

Method: Analyzing single-layer Transformers through a dynamical systems perspective, interpreting causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence, and conducting linear and nonlinear case studies to identify operational regimes.

Result: For linear systems, softmax attention's convexity constraint restricts representable dynamics and causes oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention functions as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism enabling effective state reconstruction with sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality.

Conclusion: Transformers have inherent limitations for representing certain dynamical systems due to the convexity constraint of softmax attention, but can effectively act as adaptive delay-embedding mechanisms for nonlinear systems under partial observability when given sufficient context and latent dimensionality.

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly adopted for modeling and forecasting time-series, yet their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood from a dynamical systems perspective. In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.

TL;DR: STLDM proposes a diffusion-based two-stage architecture for precipitation nowcasting that combines deterministic forecasting with latent enhancement, achieving superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current precipitation nowcasting methods where deterministic models produce blurry predictions and generative models suffer from poor accuracy, by developing a model that combines the strengths of both approaches.

Method: A two-stage architecture: (1) deterministic forecasting using a conditioning network, and (2) enhancement using a latent diffusion model that learns latent representations end-to-end alongside a Variational Autoencoder.

Result: STLDM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple radar datasets while also improving inference efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: STLDM successfully combines deterministic forecasting with latent diffusion enhancement to achieve superior precipitation nowcasting performance, demonstrating both accuracy and efficiency improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting is a critical spatio-temporal prediction task for society to prevent severe damage owing to extreme weather events. Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

*Qizhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BALLAST is a lightweight adaptation mechanism using contextual bandits (LinUCB variants) to dynamically choose election timeouts in Raft, reducing unavailability compared to static heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Randomized election timeouts in Raft can fail under conditions like long-tail latency, jitter, and partition recovery, causing repeated split votes that increase unavailability.

Method: BALLAST replaces static timeout heuristics with contextual bandits, selecting from discrete timeout options via efficient linear contextual bandits (LinUCB variants) and incorporating safe exploration to limit risk during instability.

Result: Evaluation on a discrete-event simulation with long-tail delay, loss, bursts, node heterogeneity, and turbulence shows BALLAST significantly reduces recovery and unwritable time vs. standard timeouts and heuristics in WAN settings, while staying competitive in stable LAN/WAN conditions.

Conclusion: BALLAST effectively mitigates Raft unavailability by adaptively selecting timeouts, outperforming traditional timeouts and heuristics, particularly in challenging WAN scenarios with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Randomized election timeouts are a simple and effective liveness heuristic for Raft, but they become brittle under long-tail latency, jitter, and partition recovery, where repeated split votes can inflate unavailability. This paper presents BALLAST, a lightweight online adaptation mechanism that replaces static timeout heuristics with contextual bandits. BALLAST selects from a discrete set of timeout "arms" using efficient linear contextual bandits (LinUCB variants), and augments learning with safe exploration to cap risk during unstable periods. We evaluate BALLAST on a reproducible discrete-event simulation with long-tail delay, loss, correlated bursts, node heterogeneity, and partition/recovery turbulence. Across challenging WAN regimes, BALLAST substantially reduces recovery time and unwritable time compared to standard randomized timeouts and common heuristics, while remaining competitive on stable LAN/WAN settings.

TL;DR: A unified dynamical framework for analyzing stability in deep learning via a Learning Stability Profile, linking representations, parameters, and updates to Lyapunov-type energies and covering smooth and non-smooth systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a general approach for studying stability in deep learning systems as coupled dynamics, addressing the need for understanding how architecture and optimization jointly affect robustness to perturbations.

Method: Proposes the Learning Stability Profile to track perturbations and proves the Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem, using spectral norms, step sizes, and learning rates. Extends to non-smooth cases with Clarke derivatives and variational Lyapunov functionals.

Result: The framework yields explicit stability exponents, recovers classical results (e.g., for feedforward networks and stochastic gradient methods), and applies to systems like ReLU networks and stochastic subgradient flows.

Conclusion: The theory unifies stability analysis across architectures and methods, clarifying robustness and sensitivity, and lays groundwork for extensions to continuous-time limits and geometric formulations.

Abstract: We propose a unified analytic and variational framework for studying stability in deep learning systems viewed as coupled representation-parameter dynamics. The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations. It also provides a foundation for further extensions to continuous-time limits and geometric formulations of learning dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes prerequisites for training LLMs on chemical reasoning via reinforcement learning, proposing mid-stage training techniques to improve latent solvability and boost performance on tasks like reaction naming and material generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) can develop reasoning skills through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards, but recent studies show reinforcement learning (RL) only works if the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers, a property termed 'latent solvability'. This work investigates how chemical reasoning capabilities emerge and what prerequisites are needed for chemistry applications.

Method: The paper identifies two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: symbolic competence and latent chemical knowledge. To address these, it proposes Mid-Stage Scientific Training (MiST), which includes data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These techniques aim to enhance latent solvability before RL fine-tuning.

Result: MiST raises the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x. This enables RL to improve top-1 accuracy from 10.9% to 63.9% on organic reaction naming and from 40.6% to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar gains are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, with the approach producing interpretable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: The results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training in LLMs and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities for complex domains like chemistry.

Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces.

TL;DR: A momentum-based algorithm ARS-OPT improves hard-label black-box adversarial attack query efficiency, with an enhanced version PARS-OPT using surrogate-model priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High query complexity hinders practical deployment of hard-label black-box adversarial attacks.

Method: Propose ARS-OPT, inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient, which estimates gradient for future ray direction using momentum; enhance it as PARS-OPT with surrogate-model priors.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows faster convergence; experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 surpass 13 state-of-the-art methods in query efficiency.

Conclusion: ARS-OPT and PARS-OPT offer efficient optimization for black-box attacks, with strong theoretical and empirical performance.

Abstract: In hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, where only the top-1 predicted label is accessible, the prohibitive query complexity poses a major obstacle to practical deployment. In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method surpasses 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model merging lacks theoretical guarantees for generalization, especially in coefficient scaling, leading to brittle performance; there's a need for principled objectives to guide merging and improve robustness.

Method: The authors establish a flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound with a 'cross-task heterogeneity' term, frame merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on unlabeled data, and implement SAMerging using Sharpness-Aware Minimization to find flat minima.

Result: SAMerging achieves state-of-the-art performance across vision and NLP benchmarks, demonstrating improved generalization and robustness in model merging.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical foundation for model merging, introduces an effective objective via knowledge distillation, and validates SAMerging's superiority empirically, advancing the field beyond heuristic approaches.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a lightweight alternative to joint multi-task learning (MTL), yet the generalization properties of merged models remain largely unexplored. Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a "cross-task heterogeneity" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk. Guided by the flatness-aware bound derived, (iii) we operationalize this objective via SAMerging, a method that employs Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to find flat minima. Empirically, SAMerging establishes a new state of the art across vision and NLP benchmarks, achieving remarkable performance. The code is available at https://github.com/arshandalili/SAMerging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A computational framework that uses patient transcriptomics, molecular modeling, and metaheuristic optimization to generate personalized drug candidates for AML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AML remains challenging due to molecular heterogeneity and high relapse rates, lacking effective precision medicine options.

Method: Analyze TCGA-LAML RNA-seq data with WGCNA to identify biomarkers; model structures with AlphaFold3; druggability with DOGSiteScorer; develop metaheuristic algorithm for ligand generation; evaluate candidates via ADMET and docking.

Result: Prioritized 20 biomarkers (e.g., HK3, SIGLEC9); generated novel chemical entities with QED scores 0.5-0.7; identified ligands like Ligand L1 with binding free energy -6.571 kcal/mol.

Conclusion: The framework successfully produces pharmacologically viable, patient-tailored leads, offering a scalable approach for precision oncology in AML.

Abstract: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains a clinical challenge due to its extreme molecular heterogeneity and high relapse rates. While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end computational framework that bridges the gap between patient-specific transcriptomics and de novo drug discovery. By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker. These results demonstrate that integrating systems biology with metaheuristic molecular assembly can produce pharmacologically viable, patient tailored leads, offering a scalable blueprint for precision oncology in AML and beyond

### [89] [Learning to Solve PDEs on Neural Shape Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21311)
*Lilian Welschinger,Yilin Liu,Zican Wang,Niloy Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A mesh-free neural operator enables solving surface PDEs directly on neural shape representations, avoiding mesh extraction or per-instance training, with good generalization and differentiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a mismatch between modern neural 3D representations and traditional mesh-based PDE solvers, forcing inefficient workflows with no end-to-end solutions for neural domains.

Method: A local update operator is learned from neural shape attributes, trained once on a single shape, and generalizes across variations, integrating with neural surface representations.

Result: The method slightly outperforms CPM and stays reasonably close to FEM in benchmarks (heat equation, Poisson on sphere) and real neural assets, providing first end-to-end PDE solving pipeline for neural/classical surfaces.

Conclusion: The mesh-free neural operator offers accurate, fast inference for surface PDEs on neural representations without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization, enabling end-to-end differentiable workflows.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on shapes underpins many shape analysis and engineering tasks; yet, prevailing PDE solvers operate on polygonal/triangle meshes while modern 3D assets increasingly live as neural representations. This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations. Code will be released on acceptance.

### [90] [Does the Data Processing Inequality Reflect Practice? On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21315)
*Roy Turgeman,Tom Tirer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies when and why low-level processing (e.g., signal enhancement or encoding) can improve classification accuracy, despite the data processing inequality, by analyzing a binary classification setup and supporting with empirical evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The data processing inequality suggests no benefit in enhancing signals before classification, proven optimal for Bayes classifiers, but low-level processing is common in practice. The paper aims to understand when and why such processing helps classification.

Method: A comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup with a classifier converging to the optimal Bayes classifier. Proves existence of pre-classification processing that improves accuracy for finite training samples. Explores effects of class separation, training set size, and class balance on gain, supported by empirical investigation of the setup and practical deep classifiers on benchmarks.

Result: The paper proves that for any finite number of training samples, pre-classification processing exists to improve classification accuracy. Empirical studies on benchmarks show consistent trends with theoretical results regarding denoising, encoding, and variations in training set size, class distribution, and noise level.

Conclusion: Low-level processing can be beneficial for classification in practical scenarios with finite data, challenging strict application of the data processing inequality. The findings provide theoretical and empirical insights into when such processing enhances accuracy.

Abstract: The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform "low-level" tasks before "high-level" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.

### [91] [Towards Optimal Performance and Action Consistency Guarantees in Dec-POMDPs with Inconsistent Beliefs and Limited Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20778)
*Moshe Rafaeli Shimron,Vadim Indelman*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A decentralized framework for multi-agent decision-making that handles belief inconsistencies, provides performance guarantees, and uses selective communication to improve safety and coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world scenarios, agents often have inconsistent beliefs due to limited communication, leading to poor coordination and unsafe performance, but existing approaches assume identical beliefs, which is impractical.

Method: Introduce a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies, provides probabilistic guarantees for action consistency and performance relative to an open-loop POMDP, and selectively triggers communication only when needed.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in simulations, demonstrating enhanced performance and safety.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses belief inconsistencies in multi-agent systems, offering a practical solution with communication efficiency and robust guarantees, paving the way for safer autonomous operations.

Abstract: Multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty is fundamental for effective and safe autonomous operation. In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference. Simulation results show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

### [92] [DAO-Agent: Zero Knowledge-Verified Incentives for Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20973)
*Yihan Xia,Taotao Wang,Wenxin Xu,Shengli Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: DAO-Agent is a framework that uses on-chain DAO governance, off-chain ZKP for Shapley-based contribution measurement, and a hybrid architecture to enable auditable task execution and fair incentives for autonomous LLM agents in trustless environments, reducing verification gas costs by 99.9% compared to on-chain alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous LLM-based multi-agent systems operate in trustless environments where centralized coordination faces challenges like transparency in contribution measurement and fair incentive distribution. Blockchain is proposed but introduces high on-chain costs and risks exposing agents' sensitive information. The core challenge is to enable auditable execution and fair incentives while preserving strategic privacy and minimizing on-chain costs.

Method: The DAO-Agent framework integrates three key innovations: (1) an on-chain DAO governance mechanism for transparent coordination and immutable logging, (2) a ZKP mechanism that enables Shapley-based contribution measurement off-chain, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture for verifying ZKP-validated contributions on-chain with minimal computational overhead.

Result: Implementation and end-to-end experiments using a crypto trading task show that DAO-Agent achieves up to 99.9% reduction in verification gas costs compared to naive on-chain alternatives. Verification complexity remains constant-time, stable as coalition size increases, establishing a scalable foundation for agent coordination in decentralized environments.

Conclusion: DAO-Agent successfully addresses the challenges of trustless coordination for autonomous LLM agents by combining decentralized on-chain governance with off-chain ZKP-based contribution measurement. This hybrid approach ensures transparency, fairness, privacy preservation, and significant cost reduction, making it a scalable solution for decentralized multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Autonomous Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising paradigm for facilitating cross-application and cross-organization collaborations. These autonomous agents often operate in trustless environments, where centralized coordination faces significant challenges, such as the inability to ensure transparent contribution measurement and equitable incentive distribution. While blockchain is frequently proposed as a decentralized coordination platform, it inherently introduces high on-chain computation costs and risks exposing sensitive execution information of the agents. Consequently, the core challenge lies in enabling auditable task execution and fair incentive distribution for autonomous LLM agents in trustless environments, while simultaneously preserving their strategic privacy and minimizing on-chain costs. To address this challenge, we propose DAO-Agent, a novel framework that integrates three key technical innovations: (1) an on-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance mechanism for transparent coordination and immutable logging; (2) a ZKP mechanism approach that enables Shapley-based contribution measurement off-chain, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture that verifies ZKP-validated contribution measurements on-chain with minimal computational overhead. We implement DAO-Agent and conduct end-to-end experiments using a crypto trading task as a case study. Experimental results demonstrate that DAO-Agent achieves up to 99.9% reduction in verification gas costs compared to naive on-chain alternatives, with constant-time verification complexity that remains stable as coalition size increases, thereby establishing a scalable foundation for agent coordination in decentralized environments.

### [93] [A Plan Reuse Mechanism for LLM-Driven Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21309)
*Guopeng Li,Ruiqi Wu,Haisheng Tan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: AgentReuse is a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents that uses intent classification to evaluate request similarities, achieving high reuse rates and reducing latency by over 93% compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-driven agents face high latency in plan generation, degrading user experience, and real-world data shows 30% of requests are similar, enabling plan reuse but challenging due to diverse natural language expressions and unstructured plan texts.

Method: The paper presents AgentReuse, which leverages semantic similarities and differences in requests, using intent classification to evaluate request similarities and enable plan reuse.

Result: Experimental results on a real-world dataset show AgentReuse achieves 93% effective plan reuse rate, F1 score of 0.9718, accuracy of 0.9459 in similarity evaluation, and reduces latency by 93.12% compared to non-reuse baselines.

Conclusion: AgentReuse effectively addresses latency issues in LLM-driven agents by reusing plans for similar requests, significantly improving performance and user experience through accurate similarity assessment.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into personal assistants, like Xiao Ai and Blue Heart V, effectively enhances their ability to interact with humans, solve complex tasks, and manage IoT devices. Such assistants are also termed LLM-driven agents. Upon receiving user requests, the LLM-driven agent generates plans using an LLM, executes these plans through various tools, and then returns the response to the user. During this process, the latency for generating a plan with an LLM can reach tens of seconds, significantly degrading user experience. Real-world dataset analysis shows that about 30% of the requests received by LLM-driven agents are identical or similar, which allows the reuse of previously generated plans to reduce latency. However, it is difficult to accurately define the similarity between the request texts received by the LLM-driven agent through directly evaluating the original request texts. Moreover, the diverse expressions of natural language and the unstructured format of plan texts make implementing plan reuse challenging. To address these issues, we present and implement a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents called AgentReuse. AgentReuse leverages the similarities and differences among requests' semantics and uses intent classification to evaluate the similarities between requests and enable the reuse of plans. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AgentReuse achieves a 93% effective plan reuse rate, an F1 score of 0.9718, and an accuracy of 0.9459 in evaluating request similarities, reducing latency by 93.12% compared with baselines without using the reuse mechanism.
