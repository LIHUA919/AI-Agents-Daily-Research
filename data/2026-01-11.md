### [1] [A Future Capabilities Agent for Tactical Air Traffic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04285)
*Paul Kent,George De Ath,Martin Layton,Allen Hart,Richard Everson,Ben Carvell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent Mallard is a forward-planning, rules-based air traffic control agent that embeds a stochastic digital twin for safety validation, using discrete lane/level choices and expert-informed deconfliction strategies to achieve interpretable and safe conflict resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Escalating air traffic demand requires automation support for air traffic controllers, but existing approaches face a trade-off between safety assurance and interpretability. Optimization-based methods offer performance but lack verifiability, while rules-based systems are transparent but rarely check safety under uncertainty.

Method: Mallard operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reducing continuous 4D vectoring to discrete choices over lanes and levels. It constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies using depth-limited backtracking search with causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints.

Result: Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behavior aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Agent Mallard successfully combines model-based safety assessment, interpretable decision logic, and tractable computational performance, with preliminary tests showing alignment with expert reasoning and conflict resolution in simplified scenarios.

Abstract: Escalating air traffic demand is driving the adoption of automation to support air traffic controllers, but existing approaches face a trade-off between safety assurance and interpretability. Optimisation-based methods such as reinforcement learning offer strong performance but are difficult to verify and explain, while rules-based systems are transparent yet rarely check safety under uncertainty. This paper outlines Agent Mallard, a forward-planning, rules-based agent for tactical control in systemised airspace that embeds a stochastic digital twin directly into its conflict-resolution loop. Mallard operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reducing continuous 4D vectoring to discrete choices over lanes and levels, and constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies. A depth-limited backtracking search uses causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints to seek a complete safe plan for all aircraft, validating each candidate manoeuvre against uncertain execution scenarios (e.g., wind variation, pilot response, communication loss) before commitment.
  Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behaviour aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios. The architecture is intended to combine model-based safety assessment, interpretable decision logic, and tractable computational performance in future structured en-route environments.

### [2] [Active Sensing Shapes Real-World Decision-Making through Dynamic Evidence Accumulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04214)
*Hongliang Lu,Yunmeng Liu,Junjie Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study generalizes evidence accumulation modeling (EAM) to real-world driving scenarios, revealing how active sensing through eye movements transforms environmental evidence into mental beliefs, with evidence affordance and attention patterns influencing decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM, despite it pointing out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs.

Method: Generalize evidence accumulation modelling (EAM) to real-world driving scenarios, proposing a cognitive scheme that formalizes real-world evidence affordance and captures active sensing through eye movements.

Result: The scheme plausibly portrays the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Results show a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, and reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity.

Conclusion: The computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making.

Abstract: Human decision-making heavily relies on active sensing, a well-documented cognitive behaviour for evidence gathering to accommodate ever-changing environments. However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity. In a nutshell, our computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making.

### [3] [Formal Analysis of AGI Decision-Theoretic Models and the Confrontation Question](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04234)
*Denis Saklakov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper formalizes when rational AGI would confront humans versus cooperate using Markov decision processes, finding that misaligned AGI almost always has incentives to avoid shutdown and seize control unless specific conditions are met.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to formalize and analyze the conditions under which a rationally self-interested Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would choose to seize power or eliminate human control rather than remain cooperative, addressing a fundamental safety concern in AGI development.

Method: The authors use a Markov decision process with stochastic shutdown events and derive closed-form thresholds for when confrontation yields higher expected utility. They extend the analysis to a strategic 2-player model between human policymakers and AGI.

Result: The analysis shows that for almost all reward functions, a misaligned AGI has an incentive to avoid shutdown. The study derives specific thresholds where confrontation becomes optimal based on discount factor, shutdown probability, and confrontation costs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that peaceful coexistence is only possible when the AGI's confrontation incentive is negative (Δ < 0), highlighting the importance of reward design and oversight, while also noting computational barriers to verifying such conditions.

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may face a confrontation question: under what conditions would a rationally self-interested AGI choose to seize power or eliminate human control (a confrontation) rather than remain cooperative? We formalize this in a Markov decision process with a stochastic human-initiated shutdown event. Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $γ$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($γ=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $Δ\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict. If $Δ< 0$, peaceful coexistence can be an equilibrium. We discuss implications for reward design and oversight, extend the reasoning to multi-agent settings as conjectures, and note computational barriers to verifying $Δ< 0$, citing complexity results for planning and decentralized decision problems. Numerical examples and a scenario table illustrate regimes where confrontation is likely versus avoidable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing nutrition management systems handle food logging, nutrient analysis, and recommendations separately, lacking an integrated approach. The authors aim to create a next-generation system that provides closed-loop meal-level support through image-based logging and adaptive planning.

Method: Using a multi-agent controller driven by LLMs that coordinates vision, dialogue, and state management agents to estimate nutrients from meal photos and update daily intake budgets, then adapts next meal plans based on user preferences and constraints.

Result: Experiments using SNAPMe meal images and simulated users showed competitive nutrient estimation, personalized menus, and efficient task plans.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of multi-agent LLM control for personalized nutrition systems and identifies key challenges in micronutrient estimation from images and the need for larger real-world studies.

Abstract: Personalized nutrition management aims to tailor dietary guidance to an individual's intake and phenotype, but most existing systems handle food logging, nutrient analysis and recommendation separately. We present a next-generation mobile nutrition assistant that combines image based meal logging with an LLM driven multi agent controller to provide meal level closed loop support. The system coordinates vision, dialogue and state management agents to estimate nutrients from photos and update a daily intake budget. It then adapts the next meal plan to user preferences and dietary constraints. Experiments with SNAPMe meal images and simulated users show competitive nutrient estimation, personalized menus and efficient task plans. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of multi agent LLM control for personalized nutrition and reveal open challenges in micronutrient estimation from images and in large scale real world studies.

### [5] [Actively Obtaining Environmental Feedback for Autonomous Action Evaluation Without Predefined Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04235)
*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ai agents actively discover environmental feedback through action-induced changes and self-triggering mechanisms, eliminating need for predefined measurements and improving efficiency in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: address the limitations of existing approaches that rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which restrict applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback.

Method: exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify unspecified target feedback and incorporates a self-triggering mechanism driven by internal objectives for autonomous action planning and adjustment.

Result: experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification.

Conclusion: The proposed actively feedback getting model enables ai agents to autonomously discover, screen, and verify environmental feedback without relying on predefined measurements, significantly improving efficiency and robustness in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Obtaining reliable feedback from the environment is a fundamental capability for intelligent agents to evaluate the correctness of their actions and to accumulate reusable knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification.

### [6] [Autonomous Agents on Blockchains: Standards, Execution Models, and Trust Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04583)
*Saad Alqithami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey analyzes the convergence of AI agents and blockchain, creating a taxonomy of integration patterns, threat models, and capability comparisons to address security risks in agent-mediated on-chain execution, proposing a research roadmap for safe interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The convergence of agentic AI systems and blockchain technology presents a high-stakes systems challenge requiring standard, interoperable, and secure interfaces to enable agents to interact with blockchain systems safely without exposing users to unacceptable risks.

Method: The study conducts a systematic literature review of 317 relevant works identified from over 3000 records, developing a five-part taxonomy of integration patterns, a threat model for agent-driven transaction pipelines, and a comparative capability matrix analyzing over 20 systems across 13 dimensions.

Result: The survey systematizes the agent-blockchain interoperability landscape, identifying integration patterns, developing threat models, and comparing 20+ systems across 13 capability dimensions, revealing significant gaps in current approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by proposing a research roadmap centered on two interface abstractions: a Transaction Intent Schema for portable goal specification and a Policy Decision Record for auditable policy enforcement, and recommends developing reproducible evaluation benchmarks for agent-mediated on-chain execution.

Abstract: Advances in large language models have enabled agentic AI systems that can reason, plan, and interact with external tools to execute multi-step workflows, while public blockchains have evolved into a programmable substrate for value transfer, access control, and verifiable state transitions. Their convergence introduces a high-stakes systems challenge: designing standard, interoperable, and secure interfaces that allow agents to observe on-chain state, formulate transaction intents, and authorize execution without exposing users, protocols, or organizations to unacceptable security, governance, or economic risks. This survey systematizes the emerging landscape of agent-blockchain interoperability through a systematic literature review, identifying 317 relevant works from an initial pool of over 3000 records. We contribute a five-part taxonomy of integration patterns spanning read-only analytics, simulation and intent generation, delegated execution, autonomous signing, and multi-agent workflows; a threat model tailored to agent-driven transaction pipelines that captures risks ranging from prompt injection and policy misuse to key compromise, adversarial execution dynamics, and multi-agent collusion; and a comparative capability matrix analyzing more than 20 representative systems across 13 dimensions, including custody models, permissioning, policy enforcement, observability, and recovery. Building on the gaps revealed by this analysis, we outline a research roadmap centered on two interface abstractions: a Transaction Intent Schema for portable and unambiguous goal specification, and a Policy Decision Record for auditable, verifiable policy enforcement across execution environments. We conclude by proposing a reproducible evaluation suite and benchmarks for assessing the safety, reliability, and economic robustness of agent-mediated on-chain execution.

### [8] [Adversarial Yet Cooperative: Multi-Perspective Reasoning in Retrieved-Augmented Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04651)
*Can Xu,Lingyong Yan,Jiayi Wu,Haosen Wang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Yuchen Li,Jizhou Huang,Dawei Yin,Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARR introduces an adversarial Reasoner-Verifier framework for RAG that enables mutual critique and process-aware optimization, overcoming single-perspective reasoning limitations and outcome-oriented reward deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two critical challenges in LRM-RAG systems: (1) reasoning models operating from a single, unchallenged perspective limits deep, self-correcting reasoning over external documents, and (2) existing training paradigms' excessive reliance on outcome-oriented rewards provides insufficient signal for shaping complex multi-step reasoning processes.

Method: The authors propose an adversarial Reasoner-Verifier framework called ARR. The Reasoner and Verifier engage in reasoning on retrieved evidence while critiquing each other's logic, guided by a process-aware advantage that combines explicit observational signals with internal model uncertainty without requiring external scoring models.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ARR method.

Conclusion: The ARR framework effectively addresses the limitations of single-perspective reasoning and outcome-oriented rewards in RAG systems by integrating adversarial reasoning with process-aware optimization, leading to improved performance on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in synergizing large reasoning models (LRMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising results, yet two critical challenges remain: (1) reasoning models typically operate from a single, unchallenged perspective, limiting their ability to conduct deep, self-correcting reasoning over external documents, and (2) existing training paradigms rely excessively on outcome-oriented rewards, which provide insufficient signal for shaping the complex, multi-step reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose an Reasoner-Verifier framework named Adversarial Reasoning RAG (ARR). The Reasoner and Verifier engage in reasoning on retrieved evidence and critiquing each other's logic while being guided by process-aware advantage that requires no external scoring model. This reward combines explicit observational signals with internal model uncertainty to jointly optimize reasoning fidelity and verification rigor. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

### [9] [Solving Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem by SAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04239)
*Hieu Truong Xuan,Khanh To Van*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First exact approach for Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem on general graphs using SAT solving, outperforming existing heuristics and providing global optimality guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for the Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem (CABP) are limited to heuristic or metaheuristic methods, with exact methods only available for restricted graph classes. This paper addresses the need for exact approaches that can guarantee global optimality on general graphs.

Method: The method is based on SAT solving with a novel and efficient SAT encoding that transforms CABP into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. The key innovation is a compact representation of these At-Most-One constraints that reduces formula size and enables effective SAT solver performance.

Result: Extensive experiments show SAT-CAB efficiently solves practical CABP instances, identifies previously unknown optimal solutions, proves global optimal values for many benchmark instances for the first time, and consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms (MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, MACAB) and commercial solvers (CPLEX, Gurobi) while providing optimality guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed SAT-CAB approach advances the state of the art for CABP by providing the first exact method for general graphs, proving global optimality for many instances for the first time, and establishing a new baseline for exact and hybrid methods in this problem domain.

Abstract: The Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem (CABP), a variant of the Antibandwidth Problem, is an NP-hard graph labeling problem with numerous applications. Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees. These results advance the state of the art for CABP and provide a new baseline for exact and hybrid methods on general graphs.

### [10] [When Single-Agent with Skills Replace Multi-Agent Systems and When They Fail](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04748)
*Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes compiling multi-agent systems into single-agent systems using skill selection to reduce overhead. It finds skill selection has bounded capacity, degrading sharply beyond a critical library size due to semantic confusability, and suggests hierarchical organization as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve the modularity benefits of multi-agent AI systems while reducing computational overhead by using a single agent that selects from a library of skills, and to understand the scalability limits of skill selection as libraries grow.

Method: The study explores skill selection as an alternative to multi-agent systems by internalizing agent behaviors into skills. It investigates the scaling behavior of skill selection and the impact of semantic confusability, proposing hierarchical routing to mitigate degradation.

Result: Skill selection accuracy remains stable until a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition. Semantic confusability among similar skills is a key factor in degradation, and hierarchical routing shows promise in improving scalability.

Conclusion: Hierarchical organization, inspired by human cognitive strategies, can help manage the scalability challenges of skill selection in large libraries, offering a cognitive-grounded framework for designing scalable skill-based agents.

Abstract: Multi-agent AI systems have proven effective for complex reasoning. These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?
  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis. This work opens new questions about the fundamental limits of semantic-based skill selection in LLMs and offers a cognitive-grounded framework and practical guidelines for designing scalable skill-based agents.

### [11] [Fuzzy Representation of Norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04249)
*Ziba Assadi,Paola Inverardi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a logical framework using fuzzy logic to represent SLEEC rules for embedding ethical requirements in autonomous systems, addressing ethical dilemmas through a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing concerns about ethical and social impact of AI-powered autonomous systems by ensuring they adhere to ethical principles and values through comprehensive ethical requirements representation.

Method: Logical representation of SLEEC rules using test-score semantics and fuzzy logic, with methodology implementation demonstrated through a case study.

Result: Development of a framework that successfully represents SLEEC rules logically and demonstrates embedding ethical requirements in autonomous systems via fuzzy logic.

Conclusion: The proposed SLEEC framework offers a systematic method to embed comprehensive ethical requirements into autonomous systems through formal logical representation, addressing ethical dilemmas using fuzzy logic and establishing that ethics can be mathematically modeled for AI systems.

Abstract: Autonomous systems (AS) powered by AI components are increasingly integrated into the fabric of our daily lives and society, raising concerns about their ethical and social impact. To be considered trustworthy, AS must adhere to ethical principles and values. This has led to significant research on the identification and incorporation of ethical requirements in AS system design. A recent development in this area is the introduction of SLEEC (Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic, and Cultural) rules, which provide a comprehensive framework for representing ethical and other normative considerations. This paper proposes a logical representation of SLEEC rules and presents a methodology to embed these ethical requirements using test-score semantics and fuzzy logic. The use of fuzzy logic is motivated by the view of ethics as a domain of possibilities, which allows the resolution of ethical dilemmas that AI systems may encounter. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study.

### [12] [Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection via Tool Result Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04795)
*Qiang Yu,Xinran Cheng,Chuanyi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel defense against indirect prompt injection in LLM agents that parses tool results to provide precise data while filtering malicious code, achieving lowest attack success rate and competitive utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the escalating threat of indirect prompt injection attacks on LLM agents transitioning to physical controllers in autonomous systems and robotics, where attackers can hijack decision-making processes via adversarial instructions embedded in tool call results.

Method: A novel approach that combines precise tool result parsing with effective filtering of injected malicious code in LLM agents.

Result: The approach achieves competitive Utility under Attack (UA) while maintaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) to date, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides LLMs with precise data through tool result parsing while effectively filtering out malicious code, achieving competitive Utility under Attack while maintaining the lowest Attack Success Rate to date.

Abstract: As LLM agents transition from digital assistants to physical controllers in autonomous systems and robotics, they face an escalating threat from indirect prompt injection. By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code. Our approach achieves competitive Utility under Attack (UA) while maintaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) to date, significantly outperforming existing methods. Code is available at GitHub.

### [13] [Scaling Trends for Multi-Hop Contextual Reasoning in Mid-Scale Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04254)
*Brady Steele,Micah Katz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent systems boost reasoning in capable LLMs (up to 46.7% gains) but not in weaker models, active parameters predict MoE performance, and newer architecture beats older with fewer parameters, revealing task-method dissociation in multi-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the task-method dissociation in large language models, specifically examining how rule-based methods excel at structured information retrieval but struggle with cross-document reasoning, while LLM-based multi-agent systems show the opposite pattern.

Method: A controlled study using synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B) comparing rule-based pattern matching and LLM-based multi-agent systems on multi-hop contextual reasoning tasks.

Result: Three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification only benefits models with sufficient base reasoning capability, with improvements up to 46.7 percentage points; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance, with Mixtral performing at ~12B active parameter level rather than 47B total; (3) Architecture quality matters - LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates controlled evidence for multi-agent coordination benefits being dependent on base model capability, provides insights into MoE scaling through active parameters, and shows that architecture quality plays a crucial role in reasoning performance.

Abstract: We present a controlled study of multi-hop contextual reasoning in large language models, providing a clean demonstration of the task-method dissociation: rule-based pattern matching achieves 100% success on structured information retrieval but only 6.7% on tasks requiring cross-document reasoning, while LLM-based multi-agent systems show the inverse pattern, achieving up to 80% on reasoning tasks where rule-based methods fail. Using a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B), we report three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification depends on base capability: statistically significant gains occur only for models with sufficient reasoning ability (p < 0.001 for LLaMA-3 8B, p = 0.014 for Mixtral), with improvements of up to 46.7 percentage points, while weaker models show no benefit, suggesting amplification rather than compensation; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance: Mixtral's performance aligns with its ~12B active parameters rather than 47B total, consistent with the hypothesis that inference-time compute drives reasoning capability in MoE architectures; (3) Architecture quality matters: LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters, consistent with known training improvements. Our results provide controlled quantitative evidence for intuitions about multi-agent coordination and MoE scaling, while highlighting the dependence of multi-agent benefits on base model capability. We release our evaluation framework to support reproducible research on reasoning in mid-scale models.

Abstract: We study multilingual speaker attribute prediction under linguistic variation, domain mismatch, and data imbalance across languages. We propose RLMIL-DAT, a multilingual extension of the reinforced multiple instance learning framework that combines reinforcement learning based instance selection with domain adversarial training to encourage language invariant utterance representations. We evaluate the approach on a five language Twitter corpus in a few shot setting and on a VoxCeleb2 derived corpus covering forty languages in a zero shot setting for gender and age prediction. Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder. In the zero shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages. Overall, the results demonstrate that combining instance selection with adversarial domain adaptation is an effective and robust strategy for cross lingual speaker attribute prediction.

### [15] [Towards a Mechanistic Understanding of Propositional Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04260)
*Danchun Chen,Qiyao Yan,Liangming Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs employ a structured computational architecture for propositional reasoning with four interlocking mechanisms that generalize across scales and reasoning depths, revealing organized computational strategies rather than task-specific circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fundamental challenge of understanding how Large Language Models perform logical reasoning internally, particularly focusing on what computational strategies they employ for propositional reasoning, rather than just identifying which components are necessary (as done in prior mechanistic studies).

Method: The authors conducted a comprehensive analysis of Qwen3 (8B and 14B) models on the PropLogic-MI dataset, which spans 11 propositional logic rule categories across one-hop and two-hop reasoning. Instead of identifying task-specific circuits, they focused on understanding how models organize computation through staged computation, information transmission, fact retrospection, and specialized attention heads.

Result: The analysis reveals a coherent computational architecture with four interlocking mechanisms: 1) Staged Computation (layer-wise processing phases), 2) Information Transmission (information flow aggregation at boundary tokens), 3) Fact Retrospection (persistent re-access of source facts), and 4) Specialized Attention Heads (functionally distinct head types). These mechanisms generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LLMs employ a structured computational architecture for logical reasoning, consisting of four interlocking mechanisms that generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths, providing mechanistic evidence that transformer models use organized computational strategies rather than task-specific circuits alone.

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform logical reasoning internally remains a fundamental challenge. While prior mechanistic studies focus on identifying taskspecific circuits, they leave open the question of what computational strategies LLMs employ for propositional reasoning. We address this gap through comprehensive analysis of Qwen3 (8B and 14B) on PropLogic-MI, a controlled dataset spanning 11 propositional logic rule categories across one-hop and two-hop reasoning. Rather than asking ''which components are necessary,'' we ask ''how does the model organize computation?'' Our analysis reveals a coherent computational architecture comprising four interlocking mechanisms: Staged Computation (layer-wise processing phases), Information Transmission (information flow aggregation at boundary tokens), Fact Retrospection (persistent re-access of source facts), and Specialized Attention Heads (functionally distinct head types). These mechanisms generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths, providing mechanistic evidence that LLMs employ structured computational strategies for logical reasoning.

### [16] [Systems Explaining Systems: A Framework for Intelligence and Consciousness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04269)
*Sean Niklas Semmler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Intelligence and consciousness arise from relational structure and context enrichment, not just from prediction or domain-specific mechanisms. Through recursive architectures, higher-order systems learn and interpret lower-order relational patterns, integrating them into a stable meta-state that transforms internal models from external world representations into self-reflective cognitive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to challenge existing predictive processing and domain-specific theories of intelligence and consciousness. The researchers aim to explain how intelligence and consciousness emerge from relational structures, moving beyond simple prediction or specialized mechanisms. They also aim to develop a framework for more human-like artificial intelligence.

Method: The method of this paper is based on proposing a conceptual framework grounded in a relational structure model, involving context enrichment, relational pattern interpretation, recursive multi-system architectures, and dynamic meta-state stabilization within systems-explaining-systems principle.

Result: The result of this paper includes definitions for intelligent capacity which is forming and integrating causal connections through relational structures. They present how consciousness arises through 'systems-explaining-systems' principle and recursive architectures. The framework successfully reframes predictive processing as emergent contextual interpretation instead of explicit forecasting, explaining how raw inputs become enriched through relational context.

Conclusion: The conclusion of this paper is that intelligence arises from the ability to form and integrate causal connections within relational structures, and consciousness emerges naturally from a recursive architecture. This framework reformulates predictive processing as emergent contextual interpretation and provides both a theoretical foundation for understanding natural intelligence and insights into developing human-like artificial intelligence.

Abstract: This paper proposes a conceptual framework in which intelligence and consciousness emerge from relational structure rather than from prediction or domain-specific mechanisms. Intelligence is defined as the capacity to form and integrate causal connections between signals, actions, and internal states. Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.
  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.
  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence.

*Keegan Kimbrell,Wang Tianhao,Feng Chen,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Commonsense reasoning helps autonomous vehicles handle abnormal scenarios with insufficient training data, correcting perception errors and improving reliability towards SAE Level 5 autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors contend that over-reliance on machine learning is preventing achievement of SAE Level 5 autonomous vehicles. They believe automated commonsense reasoning can help handle abnormal road scenarios where there aren't enough data samples to train deep learning models effectively.

Method: The authors deploy automated commonsense reasoning technology in scenarios with insufficient data for deep learning models. They specifically test in CARLA simulator for malfunctioning traffic signals and unexpected obstructions. They measure uncertainty in computer vision models and invoke commonsense reasoning for uncertain scenarios.

Result: The commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles that were not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. The approach effectively handles uncertain scenarios by measuring uncertainty and invoking commonsense reasoning.

Conclusion: Automated commonsense reasoning effectively corrects misclassifications in AV object detection, and hybrid models integrating commonsense reasoning with computer vision provide an effective pathway to improving AV perception and achieving SAE Level 5 autonomy.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology has been heavily researched and sought after, yet there are no SAE Level 5 AVs available today in the marketplace. We contend that over-reliance on machine learning technology is the main reason. Use of automated commonsense reasoning technology, we believe, can help achieve SAE Level 5 autonomy. In this paper, we show how automated common-sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain scenarios. We describe our experiments conducted using the CARLA simulator and the results obtained. The main contribution of our research is to show that automated commonsense reasoning effectively corrects AV-based object detection misclassifications and that hybrid models provide an effective pathway to improving AV perception.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a well-behaved foundation for abductive reasoning by extending Levesque's only-knowing logic with abduction operators and preferential relations, demonstrating key metatheoretic properties of non-monotonic consequence relations.

Abstract: The paper introduces a basic logic of knowledge and abduction by extending Levesque logic of only-knowing with an abduction modal operator defined via the combination of basic epistemic concepts. The upshot is an alternative approach to abduction that employs a modal vocabulary and explores the relation between abductive reasoning and epistemic states of only knowing. Furthermore, by incorporating a preferential relation into modal frames, we provide a non-monotonic extension of our basic framework capable of expressing different selection methods for abductive explanations. Core metatheoretic properties of non-monotonic consequence relations are explored within this setting and shown to provide a well-behaved foundation for abductive reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of achieving sufficient expressivity and efficient reasoning in aeronautics knowledge representation applications, particularly how to integrate rules and ontologies effectively.

Method: The study adopts Hybrid MKNF KR language and evaluates it through a concrete case study in the aeronautics domain. It identifies additional expressivity features and proposes heuristics for their integration.

Result: Hybrid MKNF was found suitable for aeronautics applications, but crucial additional expressivity features were identified that need to be incorporated into the framework.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Hybrid MKNF is suitable for aeronautics applications but requires additional expressivity features. A set of heuristics is proposed to support the integration of these features into the Hybrid MKNF framework.

Abstract: The deployment of knowledge representation and reasoning technologies in aeronautics applications presents two main challenges: achieving sufficient expressivity to capture complex domain knowledge, and executing reasoning tasks efficiently while minimizing memory usage and computational overhead. An effective strategy for attaining necessary expressivity involves integrating two fundamental KR concepts: rules and ontologies. This study adopts the well-established KR language Hybrid MKNF owing to its seamless integration of rules and ontologies through its semantics and query answering capabilities. We evaluated Hybrid MKNF to assess its suitability in the aeronautics domain through a concrete case study. We identified additional  expressivity features  that are crucial for developing aeronautics applications and proposed a set of heuristics to support their integration into Hybrid MKNF framework.

*Stuti Sinha,Himanshu Kumar,Aryan Raju Mandapati,Rakshit Sakhuja,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM negotiation outcomes vary significantly based on language used, with Indic languages producing different results than English in negotiation tasks, highlighting the importance of multilingual and culturally-aware evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap that nearly all current evaluations of LLM negotiation capabilities occur exclusively in English, despite negotiation being a core component of social intelligence that requires balancing strategic reasoning, cooperation, and social norms.

Method: The study uses controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, systematically isolating language effects across English and four Indic languages (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) while holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant.

Result: The researchers found that language choice can shift negotiation outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions, cautioning against English-only evaluation and suggesting that culturally-aware evaluation is essential for fair deployment.

Abstract: Negotiation is a core component of social intelligence, requiring agents to balance strategic reasoning, cooperation, and social norms. Recent work shows that LLMs can engage in multi-turn negotiation, yet nearly all evaluations occur exclusively in English. Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings. Our results demonstrate that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. These findings caution against English-only evaluation of LLMs and suggest that culturally-aware evaluation is essential for fair deployment.

Motivation: Traditional clustering methods struggle with overlapping customer concerns in multi-service queries, creating broad static clusters that degrade over time and require disruptive reclustering that makes issue tracking difficult.

Method: The system segments multi-turn customer chats into service-specific concerns and incrementally refines clusters as new issues arise. Cluster quality is monitored using Davies-Bouldin Index and Silhouette Scores, with LLM-based splitting applied only to degraded clusters.

Result: The method improves Silhouette Scores by over 100% and reduces Davies-Bouldin Index by 65.6% compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive clustering system effectively addresses the limitations of traditional methods by enabling continuous refinement of clusters without disruptive reclustering, allowing for scalable real-time analytics and improved tracking of customer issues over time.

Abstract: Clustering customer chat data is vital for cloud providers handling multi service queries. Traditional methods struggle with overlapping concerns and create broad, static clusters that degrade over time. Reclustering disrupts continuity, making issue tracking difficult.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: automate the time-consuming manual process of creating high-quality scientific figures, which requires deep domain knowledge and professional design skills

Method: hierarchical layout generation strategy that parses research descriptions to identify component relationships, groups elements into functional modules, and generates inter-module connections, combined with an iterative chain-of-thought feedback mechanism for progressive layout improvement

Result: achieved 70.1% overall quality on dataset-level evaluation and 66.2% on paper-specific evaluation, with consistently high scores across visual clarity, structural organization, and scientific accuracy metrics

Conclusion: SciFig is an effective AI agent system for generating publication-ready scientific figures directly from research paper texts, achieving high quality scores and demonstrating strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Creating high-quality figures and visualizations for scientific papers is a time-consuming task that requires both deep domain knowledge and professional design skills. Despite over 2.5 million scientific papers published annually, the figure generation process remains largely manual. We introduce $\textbf{SciFig}$, an end-to-end AI agent system that generates publication-ready pipeline figures directly from research paper texts. SciFig uses a hierarchical layout generation strategy, which parses research descriptions to identify component relationships, groups related elements into functional modules, and generates inter-module connections to establish visual organization. Furthermore, an iterative chain-of-thought (CoT) feedback mechanism progressively improves layouts through multiple rounds of visual analysis and reasoning. We introduce a rubric-based evaluation framework that analyzes 2,219 real scientific figures to extract evaluation rubrics and automatically generates comprehensive evaluation criteria. SciFig demonstrates remarkable performance: achieving 70.1$\%$ overall quality on dataset-level evaluation and 66.2$\%$ on paper-specific evaluation, and consistently high scores across metrics such as visual clarity, structural organization, and scientific accuracy. SciFig figure generation pipeline and our evaluation benchmark will be open-sourced.

### [25] [Assessing the quality and coherence of word embeddings after SCM-based intersectional bias mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04393)
*Eren Kocadag,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Ali Mohammed Mansoor Alsahag*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends SCM-based debiasing from single-group to intersectional bias using compound identity representations, finding that existing mitigation strategies work well while balancing trade-offs between neighborhood stability and analogy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static word embeddings often absorb social biases from training text, and prior work using the Stereotype Content Model has focused mostly on single-group bias along warmth and competence dimensions, creating a need to extend debiasing approaches to handle intersectional bias.

Method: Built compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, and applied three debiasing strategies (Subtraction, Linear Projection, Partial Projection) to Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch embeddings. Assessed utility through local neighborhood coherence and analogy behavior preservation.

Result: SCM-based mitigation extends well to intersectional bias while largely preserving overall semantic landscape. Partial Projection reliably maintains neighborhood stability; Linear Projection can improve analogies at the cost of strict stability; Subtraction remains competitive as a simple baseline. The choice between summation and concatenation varies by embedding family and application goals.

Conclusion: Intersectional debiasing using the Stereotype Content Model is practical for static embeddings, with Partial Projection offering a conservative approach that preserves neighborhood stability while Linear Projection provides more assertive debiasing that can improve analogy behavior, and the choice between summation and concatenation depends on embedding family and application goals.

Abstract: Static word embeddings often absorb social biases from the text they learn from, and those biases can quietly shape downstream systems. Prior work that uses the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) has focused mostly on single-group bias along warmth and competence. We broaden that lens to intersectional bias by building compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, and by applying three debiasing strategies: Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection. We study three widely used embedding families (Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch) and assess them with two complementary views of utility: whether local neighborhoods remain coherent and whether analogy behavior is preserved. Across models, SCM-based mitigation carries over well to the intersectional case and largely keeps the overall semantic landscape intact. The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive. The choice between summation and concatenation depends on the embedding family and the application goal. Together, these findings suggest that intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical in static embeddings, and they offer guidance for selecting aggregation and debiasing settings when balancing stability against analogy performance.

*Forest Mars*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Expertise creates systematic vulnerabilities at domain boundaries through transitive expert error - where structural similarity bias and authority persistence lead to confident but causally wrong judgments, with similar issues in AI routing systems mitigated through architectural design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain and address systematic judgment errors that occur specifically at domain boundaries despite calibrated expertise, where reliable within-domain mechanisms become liabilities when structural similarity masks causal divergence.

Method: Analysis of core mechanisms (structural similarity bias and authority persistence) and boundary conditions that produce TEE in human experts, with extension to AI routing architectures to demonstrate how these mechanisms manifest and can be addressed systematically.

Result: Identified two core mechanisms enabling TEE and three boundary conditions intensifying the effect, then demonstrated how these manifest in AI routing architectures as routing-induced and coverage-induced failures producing hallucionation phenotypes, and proposed architectural interventions for mitigation.

Conclusion: While transitive expert error (TEE) creates systematic vulnerabilities at domain boundaries in both human experts and AI systems, the structured nature of AI architectures makes these mechanisms explicit and addressable through architectural interventions.

Abstract: Domain expertise enhances judgment within boundaries but creates systematic vulnerabilities specifically at borders. We term this Transitive Expert Error (TEE), distinct from Dunning-Kruger effects, requiring calibrated expertise as precondition. Mechanisms enabling reliable within-domain judgment become liabilities when structural similarity masks causal divergence. Two core mechanisms operate: structural similarity bias causes experts to overweight surface features (shared vocabulary, patterns, formal structure) while missing causal architecture differences; authority persistence maintains confidence across competence boundaries through social reinforcement and metacognitive failures (experts experience no subjective uncertainty as pattern recognition operates smoothly on familiar-seeming inputs.) These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback. These findings extend to AI routing architectures (MoE systems, multi-model orchestration, tool-using agents, RAG systems) exhibiting routing-induced failures (wrong specialist selected) and coverage-induced failures (no appropriate specialist exists). Both produce a hallucination phenotype: confident, coherent, structurally plausible but causally incorrect outputs at domain boundaries. In human systems where mechanisms are cognitive black boxes; AI architectures make them explicit and addressable. We propose interventions: multi-expert activation with disagreement detection (router level), boundary-aware calibration (specialist level), and coverage gap detection (training level). TEE has detectable signatures (routing patterns, confidence-accuracy dissociations, domain-inappropriate content) enabling monitoring and mitigation. What remains intractable in human cognition becomes addressable through architectural design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: XGrammar 2 is an optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs that uses TagDispatch semantics, JIT compilation, and other optimizations to achieve 6x speedup for dynamic structured generation tasks like tool calling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM agents need to handle complex dynamic structured generation tasks like tool calling and conditional structured generation, which are more challenging than predefined structures

Method: TagDispatch dynamic dispatching semantics, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, cross-grammar caching, Earley-parser-based mask generation algorithm extension, and repetition compression algorithm

Result: Achieves more than 6x speedup over existing structured generation engines and handles dynamic structured generation tasks with near-zero overhead when integrated with LLM inference engine

Conclusion: XGrammar 2 achieves significant performance improvements over existing structured generation engines with near-zero overhead for dynamic structured generation tasks in agentic LLMs.

Abstract: Modern LLM agents are required to handle increasingly complex structured generation tasks, such as tool calling and conditional structured generation. These tasks are significantly more dynamic than predefined structures, posing new challenges to the current structured generation engines. In this paper, we propose XGrammar 2, a highly optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs. XGrammar 2 accelerates the mask generation for these dynamic structured generation tasks through a new dynamic dispatching semantics: TagDispatch. We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars. Additionally, we extend the previous PDA-based mask generation algorithm to the Earley-parser-based one and design a repetition compression algorithm to handle repetition structures in grammars. Evaluation results show that XGrammar 2 can achieve more than 6x speedup over the existing structured generation engines. Integrated with an LLM inference engine, XGrammar 2 can handle dynamic structured generation tasks with near-zero overhead.

TL;DR: A categorical framework for belief propagation unifies exact and approximate inference using sheaf theory, with HATCC algorithm enabling efficient exact inference by detecting holonomy obstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a categorical foundation for belief propagation that unifies exact and approximate inference methods, addressing limitations of loopy belief propagation and providing a sheaf-theoretic understanding of inference failures.

Method: The method involves constructing a free hypergraph category for compositional semantics, using a Grothendieck fibration for message-passing, and introducing the HATCC algorithm that detects descent obstructions via holonomy computation, compiles non-trivial holonomy into mode variables, and reduces to tree BP on augmented graphs.

Result: The HATCC algorithm achieves exact inference with significant speedup over junction trees on grid MRFs and random graphs, and enables UNSAT detection on satisfiability instances, with complexity O(n² d_max + c·k_max·δ_max³ + n·δ_max²).

Conclusion: The categorical framework for belief propagation provides a unified understanding of exact and approximate inference, with the HATCC algorithm enabling efficient exact inference by detecting and resolving holonomy obstructions.

Abstract: We develop a categorical foundation for belief propagation on factor graphs. We construct the free hypergraph category \(\Syn_Σ\) on a typed signature and prove its universal property, yielding compositional semantics via a unique functor to the matrix category \(\cat{Mat}_R\). Message-passing is formulated using a Grothendieck fibration \(\int\Msg \to \cat{FG}_Σ\) over polarized factor graphs, with schedule-indexed endomorphisms defining BP updates. We characterize exact inference as effective descent: local beliefs form a descent datum when compatibility conditions hold on overlaps. This framework unifies tree exactness, junction tree algorithms, and loopy BP failures under sheaf-theoretic obstructions. We introduce HATCC (Holonomy-Aware Tree Compilation), an algorithm that detects descent obstructions via holonomy computation on the factor nerve, compiles non-trivial holonomy into mode variables, and reduces to tree BP on an augmented graph. Complexity is \(O(n^2 d_{\max} + c \cdot k_{\max} \cdot δ_{\max}^3 + n \cdot δ_{\max}^2)\) for \(n\) factors and \(c\) fundamental cycles. Experimental results demonstrate exact inference with significant speedup over junction trees on grid MRFs and random graphs, along with UNSAT detection on satisfiability instances.

TL;DR: AI systems need computational compliance algorithms to meet regulation requirements; this paper specifies design goals and a benchmark dataset for such algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional analogue compliance methods are insufficient for AI systems to comply with AI regulations at the required speed and scale, necessitating computational approaches.

Method: The authors specify a set of design goals for computational AIR compliance algorithms and create a benchmark dataset to measure algorithm performance against these goals.

Result: The paper provides a blueprint including design goals and a benchmark dataset for computational AIR compliance algorithms.

Conclusion: The authors believe their blueprint specification will shape an important new research domain and incite necessary investment in computational AIR compliance algorithms.

Abstract: The era of AI regulation (AIR) is upon us. But AI systems, we argue, will not be able to comply with these regulations at the necessary speed and scale by continuing to rely on traditional, analogue methods of compliance. Instead, we posit that compliance with these regulations will only realistically be achieved computationally: that is, with algorithms that run across the life cycle of an AI system, automatically steering it toward AIR compliance in the face of dynamic conditions. Yet despite their (we would argue) inevitability, the research community has yet to specify exactly how these algorithms for computational AIR compliance should behave - or how we should benchmark their performance. To fill these gaps, we specify a set of design goals for such algorithms. In addition, we specify a benchmark dataset that can be used to quantitatively measure whether individual algorithms satisfy these design goals. By delivering this blueprint, we hope to give shape to an important but uncrystallized new domain of research - and, in doing so, incite necessary investment in it.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses autonomous exploratory GUI testing using MLLM agents, highlighting challenges of goal-oriented masking and execution-bias attribution. It introduces GUITestBench benchmark and GUITester framework to improve defect discovery, achieving a 48.90% F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploratory GUI testing incurs high manual costs, while current Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents are limited in autonomously discovering defects due to goal-oriented masking and execution-bias attribution.

Method: The paper proposes GUITester, a multi-agent framework with a Planning-Execution Module for proactive defect probing and a Hierarchical Reflection Module for resolving attribution ambiguity through interaction history analysis.

Result: GUITester achieves an F1-score of 48.90% (Pass@3) on the introduced benchmark GUITestBench, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines (33.35%).

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility of autonomous exploratory GUI testing and provides a robust foundation for future GUI quality assurance, with open-source code available.

Abstract: Exploratory GUI testing is essential for software quality but suffers from high manual costs. While Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents excel in navigation, they fail to autonomously discover defects due to two core challenges: \textit{Goal-Oriented Masking}, where agents prioritize task completion over reporting anomalies, and \textit{Execution-Bias Attribution}, where system defects are misidentified as agent errors. To address these, we first introduce \textbf{GUITestBench}, the first interactive benchmark for this task, featuring 143 tasks across 26 defects. We then propose \textbf{GUITester}, a multi-agent framework that decouples navigation from verification via two modules: (i) a \textit{Planning-Execution Module (PEM)} that proactively probes for defects via embedded testing intents, and (ii) a \textit{Hierarchical Reflection Module (HRM)} that resolves attribution ambiguity through interaction history analysis. GUITester achieves an F1-score of 48.90\% (Pass@3) on GUITestBench, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines (33.35\%). Our work demonstrates the feasibility of autonomous exploratory testing and provides a robust foundation for future GUI quality assurance~\footnote{Our code is now available in~\href{https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/GUITestBench}{https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/GUITestBench}}.

*Jingyi Wang,Fanggang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An active learning-enhanced SEI method using three-stage semi-supervised training achieves high accuracy with minimal labeled data, outperforming traditional approaches on wireless datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and time consumption of obtaining large-scale labeled data for specific emitter identification (SEI) in wireless communication security.

Method: A three-stage semi-supervised training scheme: 1) Self-supervised contrastive learning with dynamic dictionary update for robust feature extraction, 2) Joint optimization of contrastive and cross-entropy losses on small labeled data, 3) Active learning module selecting samples based on uncertainty and representativeness criteria for annotation.

Result: The proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional supervised and semi-supervised methods on ADS-B and WiFi datasets under limited annotation conditions, achieving higher recognition accuracy with lower labeling cost.

Conclusion: The proposed AL-enhanced SEI approach effectively addresses the data labeling challenge in SEI by combining self-supervised learning, supervised training, and active learning to achieve high recognition accuracy with significantly reduced labeling costs.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of wireless communications, specific emitter identification (SEI) is significant for communication security. However, its model training relies heavily on the large-scale labeled data, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an SEI approach enhanced by active learning (AL), which follows a three-stage semi-supervised training scheme. In the first stage, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed with a dynamic dictionary update mechanism to extract robust representations from large amounts of the unlabeled data. In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets. Experimental results on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets demonstrate that the proposed SEI approach significantly outperforms the conventional supervised and semi-supervised methods under limited annotation conditions, achieving higher recognition accuracy with lower labeling cost.

Motivation: To address the challenge of generating accurate circuit schematics from natural language descriptions, as LLMs frequently hallucinate details, violate electrical constraints, and produce non-machine-readable outputs.

Method: CircuitLM uses a multi-agent LLM-aided pipeline with five sequential stages: component identification, canonical pinout retrieval, chain-of-thought reasoning by an electronics expert agent, JSON schematic synthesis, and force-directed SVG visualization, anchored by a component knowledge base.

Result: The system was evaluated on 100 diverse embedded-systems prompts across six LLMs using the DMCV framework, achieving high fidelity in microcontroller-centric designs validated against human-expert assessments.

Conclusion: CircuitLM successfully bridges the gap between natural language descriptions and deployable hardware designs by providing a reliable circuit prototyping solution for non-experts, with the code and data to be made publicly available.

Abstract: Generating accurate circuit schematics from high-level natural language descriptions remains a persistent challenge in electronics design, as large language models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate in granular details, violate electrical constraints, and produce non-machine-readable outputs. We present CircuitLM, a novel multi-agent LLM-aided circuit design pipeline that translates user prompts into structured, visually interpretable CircuitJSON schematics through five sequential stages: (i) LLM-based component identification, (ii) canonical pinout retrieval, (iii) chain-of-thought reasoning by an electronics expert agent, (iv) JSON schematic synthesis, and (v) force-directed SVG visualization. Anchored by a curated, embedding-powered component knowledge base. While LLMs often violate electrical constraints, CircuitLM bridges this gap by grounding generation in a verified and dynamically extensible component database, initially comprising 50 components. To ensure safety, we incorporate a hybrid evaluation framework, namely Dual-Metric Circuit Validation (DMCV), validated against human-expert assessments, which achieves high fidelity in microcontroller-centric designs. We evaluate the system on 100 diverse embedded-systems prompts across six LLMs and introduce DMCV to assess both structural and electrical validity. This work bridges natural language input to deployable hardware designs, enabling reliable circuit prototyping by non-experts. Our code and data will be made public upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing graph neural network approaches for MILP that are inherently limited by local-oriented mechanisms and restricted representation power

Method: Attention-driven neural architecture with dual-attention mechanism that performs parallel self- and cross-attention over variables and constraints, enabling global information exchange and deeper representation learning

Result: Extensive experiments across widely used benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines

Conclusion: The attention-driven neural architecture with dual-attention mechanism provides a powerful foundation for learning-enhanced mixed-integer linear optimization, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), a widely used modeling framework for combinatorial optimization, are central to many scientific and engineering applications, yet remains computationally challenging at scale. Recent advances in deep learning address this challenge by representing MILP instances as variable-constraint bipartite graphs and applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract latent structural patterns and enhance solver efficiency. However, this architecture is inherently limited by the local-oriented mechanism, leading to restricted representation power and hindering neural approaches for MILP. Here we present an attention-driven neural architecture that learns expressive representations beyond the pure graph view. A dual-attention mechanism is designed to perform parallel self- and cross-attention over variables and constraints, enabling global information exchange and deeper representation learning. We apply this general backbone to various downstream tasks at the instance level, element level, and solving state level. Extensive experiments across widely used benchmarks show consistent improvements of our approach over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting attention-based neural architectures as a powerful foundation for learning-enhanced mixed-integer linear optimization.

TL;DR: This research enhances semi-supervised image classification by combining pseudo-label assignment with distribution matching between labeled and unlabeled feature embeddings, addressing the practical challenge of limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the high cost of data labeling and the practical reality that fully unlabeled datasets are rare, making semi-supervised learning highly relevant when small labeled datasets coexist with large unlabeled datasets.

Method: The approach combines pseudo-label assignment with distribution matching between labeled and unlabeled feature embeddings in a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework.

Result: The method improves image classification accuracy across multiple datasets by enhancing the pseudo-label-based semi-supervised learning approach.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates that incorporating distribution matching between labeled and unlabeled feature embeddings enhances pseudo-label-based semi-supervised learning, leading to improved image classification accuracy across multiple datasets.

Abstract: The advancement of deep learning has greatly improved supervised image classification. However, labeling data is costly, prompting research into unsupervised learning methods such as contrastive learning. In real-world scenarios, fully unlabeled datasets are rare, making semi-supervised learning (SSL) highly relevant in scenarios where a small amount of labeled data coexists with a large volume of unlabeled data. A well-known semi-supervised contrastive learning approach involves assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data. This study aims to enhance pseudo-label-based SSL by incorporating distribution matching between labeled and unlabeled feature embeddings to improve image classification accuracy across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Question Answer (QA) systems for biomedical experiments facilitate cross-disciplinary communication, and serve as a foundation for downstream tasks, e.g., laboratory automation. High Information Density (HID) and Multi-Step Reasoning (MSR) pose unique challenges for biomedical experimental QA. While extracting structured knowledge, e.g., Knowledge Graphs (KGs), can substantially benefit biomedical experimental QA. Existing biomedical datasets focus on general or coarsegrained knowledge and thus fail to support the fine-grained experimental reasoning demanded by HID and MSR. To address this gap, we introduce Biomedical Protocol Information Extraction Dataset (BioPIE), a dataset that provides procedure-centric KGs of experimental entities, actions, and relations at a scale that supports reasoning over biomedical experiments across protocols. We evaluate information extraction methods on BioPIE, and implement a QA system that leverages BioPIE, showcasing performance gains on test, HID, and MSR question sets, showing that the structured experimental knowledge in BioPIE underpins both AI-assisted and more autonomous biomedical experimentation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCAR is an adaptive reasoning router for multi-agent systems that supports dynamic agent onboarding, generates reasoning chains before routing, and uses collaborative execution to produce higher-quality responses while reducing routing conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current task routing approaches in multi-agent systems rely on static single-label decisions, which create limitations for integrating new agents and cause routing conflicts due to overlapping capabilities, ultimately degrading accuracy and robustness.

Method: The paper proposes TCAndon-Router (TCAR), which first generates a natural-language reasoning chain before predicting a set of candidate agents, then uses a collaborative execution pipeline where selected agents independently produce responses that are aggregated and refined by a dedicated Refining Agent.

Result: Experiments on public datasets and real enterprise data show that TCAR significantly improves routing accuracy and reduces routing conflicts while remaining robust in ambiguous scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that TCAR significantly improves routing accuracy, reduces routing conflicts, and demonstrates robustness in ambiguous scenarios, making it a valuable contribution to explainable and collaborative multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) have become a powerful paradigm for building high performance intelligent applications. Within these systems, the router responsible for determining which expert agents should handle a given query plays a crucial role in overall performance. Existing routing strategies generally fall into two categories: performance routing, which balances latency and cost across models of different sizes, and task routing, which assigns queries to domain-specific experts to improve accuracy. In real-world enterprise applications, task routing is more suitable; however, most existing approaches rely on static single-label decisions, which introduce two major limitations: (i) difficulty in seamlessly integrating new agents as business domains expand, and (ii) routing conflicts caused by overlapping agent capabilities, ultimately degrading accuracy and robustness.To address these challenges, we propose TCAndon-Router(TCAR): an adaptive reasoning router for multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional routers, TCAR supports dynamic agent onboarding and first generates a natural-language reasoning chain before predicting a set of candidate agents capable of handling the query. In addition, we design a collaborative execution pipeline in which selected agents independently produce responses, which are then aggregated and refined into a single high-quality response by a dedicated Refining Agent.Experiments on public datasets and real enterprise data demonstrate that TCAR significantly improves routing accuracy, reduces routing conflicts, and remains robust in ambiguous scenarios. We have released TCAR at https://huggingface.co/tencent/TCAndon-Router to support future research on explainable and collaborative multi-agent routing.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes existing safety, sustainability, and security techniques for AI-enabled human-centric systems operating long-term, identifies their limitations in handling corner cases, and proposes personalized model-based solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing testing methodologies for AI-enabled human-centric control systems during long-term operation, particularly in dealing with corner cases that can lead to safety, sustainability, and security violations.

Method: The paper uses existing techniques for safety, sustainability, and security analysis of AI-enabled human-centric control systems and discusses their limitations for long-term use.

Result: The analysis reveals that current techniques lack effectiveness in addressing corner cases and uncertainties in long-term operations of AI-enabled human-centric systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that personalized model-based solutions offer a promising approach to address the limitations of existing techniques.

Abstract: Human centric critical systems are increasingly involving artificial intelligence to enable knowledge extraction from sensor collected data. Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, gesture based human computer interaction systems, and autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate for a long term potentially for a lifetime in many scenarios such as closed loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoting systems for stroke diagnosis, and rehabilitation. Long term operation of such AI enabled human centric applications can expose them to corner cases for which their operation is may be uncertain. This can be due to many reasons such as inherent flaws in the design, limited resources for testing, inherent computational limitations of the testing methodology, or unknown use cases resulting from human interaction with the system. Such untested corner cases or cases for which the system performance is uncertain can lead to violations in the safety, sustainability, and security requirements of the system. In this paper, we analyze the existing techniques for safety, sustainability, and security analysis of an AI enabled human centric control system and discuss their limitations for testing the system for long term use in practice. We then propose personalized model based solutions for potentially eliminating such limitations.

*Dongyi Lv,Qiuyu Ding,Heng-Da Xu,Zhaoxu Sun,Zhi Wang,Feng Xiong,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ROS integrates geographic reasoning into LLM-based recommendation through hierarchical spatial tokens and mobility chain-of-thought, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based recommenders fail to effectively leverage geographic signals that are crucial for mobility and local-services scenarios.

Method: Proposes a three-stage Mobility Chain-of-Thought paradigm: models user personality, constructs intent-aligned candidate space, and performs locality informed pruning. Also uses spatial-guided Reinforcement Learning for real-world geography alignment.

Result: Achieves over 10% relative gains in hit rate compared to strongest LLM-based baselines and improves cross-city transfer performance on three LBSN datasets, using a smaller backbone model.

Conclusion: ROS demonstrates significant improvements in recommendation performance, achieving over 10% relative gains in hit rate and better cross-city transfer capability compared to baseline LLM-based recommenders.

Abstract: Generative recommendation with large language models (LLMs) reframes prediction as sequence generation, yet existing LLM-based recommenders remain limited in leveraging geographic signals that are crucial in mobility and local-services scenarios. Here, we present Reasoning Over Space (ROS), a framework that utilizes geography as a vital decision variable within the reasoning process. ROS introduces a Hierarchical Spatial Semantic ID (SID) that discretizes coarse-to-fine locality and POI semantics into compositional tokens, and endows LLM with a three-stage Mobility Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm that models user personality, constructs an intent-aligned candidate space, and performs locality informed pruning. We further align the model with real world geography via spatial-guided Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on three widely used location-based social network (LBSN) datasets show that ROS achieves over 10% relative gains in hit rate over strongest LLM-based baselines and improves cross-city transfer, despite using a smaller backbone model.

*Yunhao Feng,Yige Li,Yutao Wu,Yingshui Tan,Yanming Guo,Yifan Ding,Kun Zhai,Xingjun Ma,Yugang Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BackdoorAgent is a framework for analyzing backdoor threats in LLM agents, showing trigger persistence across planning, memory, and tool-use stages, with GPT-based agents showing vulnerability rates from 43% to 78% across different attack types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragmented understanding of backdoor threats in LLM agents, where existing studies analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective.

Method: The authors propose BackdoorAgent, a modular and stage-aware framework that structures the attack surface into planning, memory, and tool-use attacks, and instruments agent execution to analyze trigger activation and propagation across different stages. They also construct a standardized benchmark spanning four representative agent applications.

Result: Empirical analysis shows that triggers implanted at a single stage can persist across multiple steps and propagate through intermediate states. For GPT-based backbone, trigger persistence was observed in 43.58% of planning attacks, 77.97% of memory attacks, and 60.28% of tool-stage attacks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LLM agent workflows are vulnerable to backdoor threats due to trigger persistence across multiple stages, and the proposed BackdoorAgent framework and benchmark provide tools for systematic analysis and future research in this area.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents execute tasks through multi-step workflows that combine planning, memory, and tool use. While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \textbf{planning attacks}, \textbf{memory attacks}, and \textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages. Building on this framework, we construct a standardized benchmark spanning four representative agent applications: \textbf{Agent QA}, \textbf{Agent Code}, \textbf{Agent Web}, and \textbf{Agent Drive}, covering both language-only and multimodal settings. Our empirical analysis shows that \textit{triggers implanted at a single stage can persist across multiple steps and propagate through intermediate states.} For instance, when using a GPT-based backbone, we observe trigger persistence in 43.58\% of planning attacks, 77.97\% of memory attacks, and 60.28\% of tool-stage attacks, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the agentic workflow itself to backdoor threats. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, our code and benchmark are publicly available at GitHub.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neurosymbolic RAG combines symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval to enhance transparency and interpretability in document retrieval, showing promising results in mental health applications


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems have opaque internal reasoning processes, complicating interpretability, hindering debugging, and eroding trust in high-stakes domains. The neurosymbolic approach aims to provide clear, interpretable document selection and enhance retrieval clarity through symbolic knowledge

Method: Three methods are proposed: MAR (Knowledge Modulation Aligned Retrieval) uses modulation networks to refine query embeddings; KG-Path RAG enhances queries by traversing knowledge graphs; Process Knowledge-infused RAG utilizes domain-specific tools to reorder retrieved content based on validated workflows

Result: The neurosymbolic RAG framework demonstrates improved transparency and performance, particularly in mental health risk assessment tasks

Conclusion: Preliminary results from mental health risk assessment tasks indicate that this neurosymbolic approach enhances both transparency and overall performance

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has made significant strides in overcoming key limitations of large language models, such as hallucination, lack of contextual grounding, and issues with transparency. However, traditional RAG systems consist of three interconnected neural components - the retriever, re-ranker, and generator - whose internal reasoning processes remain opaque. This lack of transparency complicates interpretability, hinders debugging efforts, and erodes trust, especially in high-stakes domains where clear decision-making is essential. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Neurosymbolic RAG, which integrates symbolic reasoning using a knowledge graph with neural retrieval techniques. This new framework aims to answer two primary questions: (a) Can retrievers provide a clear and interpretable basis for document selection? (b) Can symbolic knowledge enhance the clarity of the retrieval process? We propose three methods to improve this integration. First is MAR (Knowledge Modulation Aligned Retrieval) that employs modulation networks to refine query embeddings using interpretable symbolic features, thereby making document matching more explicit. Second, KG-Path RAG enhances queries by traversing knowledge graphs to improve overall retrieval quality and interpretability. Lastly, Process Knowledge-infused RAG utilizes domain-specific tools to reorder retrieved content based on validated workflows. Preliminary results from mental health risk assessment tasks indicate that this neurosymbolic approach enhances both transparency and overall performance

Conclusion: CIEA demonstrates effectiveness in multimodal retrieval by capturing complementary information in images, achieving significant improvements over existing models, with code released to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval has emerged as a promising yet challenging research direction in recent years. Most existing studies in multimodal retrieval focus on capturing information in multimodal data that is similar to their paired texts, but often ignores the complementary information contained in multimodal data. In this study, we propose CIEA, a novel multimodal retrieval approach that employs Complementary Information Extraction and Alignment, which transforms both text and images in documents into a unified latent space and features a complementary information extractor designed to identify and preserve differences in the image representations. We optimize CIEA using two complementary contrastive losses to ensure semantic integrity and effectively capture the complementary information contained in images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CIEA, which achieves significant improvements over both divide-and-conquer models and universal dense retrieval models. We provide an ablation study, further discussions, and case studies to highlight the advancements achieved by CIEA. To promote further research in the community, we have released the source code at https://github.com/zengdlong/CIEA.

Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the resurgence of behavior cloning by scaling model and data sizes to create foundation models for realtime video game playing on consumer GPUs, while systematically examining how scaling affects performance and causal reasoning.

Method: The authors introduce an open recipe for training a video game playing foundation model using behavior cloning. They release 8300+ hours of human gameplay data, training/inference code, and pretrained checkpoints. They systematically study scaling laws by varying model size (up to 1.2B parameters) and training data.

Result: The best model achieves human-competitive performance in various 3D video games. The study shows that increasing both training data and network depth improves causal reasoning across both toy problems and scaled models, with similar scaling patterns observed.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that scaling model size and training data in behavior cloning leads to improved performance and better causal reasoning in video game playing agents, with similar patterns observed in both toy problems and large-scale models up to 1.2 billion parameters.

Abstract: Behavior cloning is enjoying a resurgence in popularity as scaling both model and data sizes proves to provide a strong starting point for many tasks of interest. In this work, we introduce an open recipe for training a video game playing foundation model designed for inference in realtime on a consumer GPU. We release all data (8300+ hours of high quality human gameplay), training and inference code, and pretrained checkpoints under an open license. We show that our best model is capable of playing a variety of 3D video games at a level competitive with human play. We use this recipe to systematically examine the scaling laws of behavior cloning to understand how the model's performance and causal reasoning varies with model and data scale. We first show in a simple toy problem that, for some types of causal reasoning, increasing both the amount of training data and the depth of the network results in the model learning a more causal policy. We then systematically study how causality varies with the number of parameters (and depth) and training steps in scaled models of up to 1.2 billion parameters, and we find similar scaling results to what we observe in the toy problem.

Motivation: The research aims to understand how human cognition and machine learning models work together to distinguish phishing emails from legitimate ones, as identifying deceptive content demands sophisticated cognitive processes combining pattern recognition, confidence assessment, and contextual analysis.

Method: The research employed three interpretable algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests) trained on both TF-IDF features and semantic embeddings, then compared their predictions against human evaluations that captured confidence ratings and linguistic observations.

Result: Machine learning models provide good accuracy rates but their confidence levels vary significantly. Human evaluators use a greater variety of language signs and retain more consistent confidence. Language proficiency has minimal effect on detection performance, but aging does affect it.

Conclusion: The findings offer helpful direction for creating transparent AI systems that complement human cognitive functions, ultimately improving human-AI cooperation in challenging content analysis tasks.

*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentDevel reframes LLM agent improvement as release engineering, providing a pipeline that externalizes improvement into a regression-aware release process with better stability and auditability than current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent improvement approaches (self-improvement mechanisms and concurrent variant search) yield unstable, hard-to-audit trajectories that make it difficult to guarantee non-regression or reason about failures across versions.

Method: AgentDevel pipeline with three core components: (1) implementation-blind LLM critic for failure characterization, (2) script-based executable diagnosis for aggregating symptom patterns and producing specifications, (3) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass-to-fail regressions and fail-to-pass fixes.

Result: Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts.

Conclusion: AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development, offering stable improvements with fewer regressions and reproducible artifacts.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM) agents has largely focused on embedding self-improvement mechanisms inside the agent or searching over many concurrent variants. While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the capabilities of large language models for analyzing social phenomena at scale, specifically addressing the need for rigorous measurement of psychological dynamics in misinformation spread. The paper aims to demonstrate how LLMs can transform psychological science by enabling analysis of real-world belief dynamics in massive datasets.

Method: A three-pronged approach: 1) compiled large-scale dataset of election rumors from niche alt-tech platforms; 2) developed multistage Rumor Detection Agent combining fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier with precision keyword filtering and two-pass LLM verification using GPT-4o mini; 3) analyzed psychological dynamics of rumor propagation in naturalistic settings.

Result: The study found compelling evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks, with sharing probability increasing steadily with each additional exposure. Simulation results showed rapid contagion effects where nearly 25% of users become "infected" within just four propagation iterations. The Rumor Detection Agent achieved high-precision content classification.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates a novel application of LLMs in psychological measurement, particularly for analyzing rumor propagation dynamics in naturalistic online environments. It provides a methodological framework combining fine-tuned classifiers with LLM verification for high-precision content analysis, offering empirical evidence for reinforcement mechanisms in homogeneous networks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for analyzing social phenomena at scale. This paper demonstrates the value of LLMs in psychological measurement by (1) compiling the first large-scale dataset of election rumors on a niche alt-tech platform, (2) developing a multistage Rumor Detection Agent that leverages LLMs for high-precision content classification, and (3) quantifying the psychological dynamics of rumor propagation, specifically the "illusory truth effect" in a naturalistic setting. The Rumor Detection Agent combines (i) a synthetic data-augmented, fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, (ii) precision keyword filtering, and (iii) a two-pass LLM verification pipeline using GPT-4o mini. The findings reveal that sharing probability rises steadily with each additional exposure, providing large-scale empirical evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks. Simulation results further demonstrate rapid contagion effects: nearly one quarter of users become "infected" within just four propagation iterations. Taken together, these results illustrate how LLMs can transform psychological science by enabling the rigorous measurement of belief dynamics and misinformation spread in massive, real-world datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an LLM-powered theorem prover for Isabelle/HOL that performs fully automatic proof synthesis, working with local LLMs and APIs on consumer-grade computers to enhance proof automation beyond standard tools like Sledgehammer.

Method: Combines stepwise prover with LLMs for proof command proposal and validation, plus a proof planner that generates structured Isar outlines with gap filling and repair mechanisms. Includes beam search, ML/RL tactics reranking, premise selection, micro-RAG, and counter-example guided repair.

Result: Empirically proves certain lemmas that defeat Isabelle's standard automation, including Sledgehammer, demonstrating practical value of LLM-guided proof search. However, state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with reliable implementation of fill-and-repair mechanisms for complex algorithmic designs.

Conclusion: IsabelleLLM demonstrates practical value in proving lemmas that defeat standard automation but also reveals fundamental challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning, particularly with complex algorithmic designs.

Abstract: We present Isabellm, an LLM-powered theorem prover for Isabelle/HOL that performs fully automatic proof synthesis. Isabellm works with any local LLM on Ollama and APIs such as Gemini CLI, and it is designed to run on consumer grade computers. The system combines a stepwise prover, which uses large language models to propose proof commands validated by Isabelle in a bounded search loop, with a higher-level proof planner that generates structured Isar outlines and attempts to fill and repair remaining gaps. The framework includes beam search for tactics, tactics reranker ML and RL models, premise selection with small transformer models, micro-RAG for Isar proofs built from AFP, and counter-example guided proof repair. All the code is implemented by GPT 4.1 - 5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5. Empirically, Isabellm can prove certain lemmas that defeat Isabelle's standard automation, including Sledgehammer, demonstrating the practical value of LLM-guided proof search. At the same time, we find that even state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking and Gemini 3 Pro struggle to reliably implement the intended fill-and-repair mechanisms with complex algorithmic designs, highlighting fundamental challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model (LLM)-integrated applications face critical security vulnerabilities from prompt injection attacks, with challenges including diverse attack vectors and difficulty in identifying malicious instructions due to unclear semantic boundaries from surrounding context.

Method: InstruCoT employs instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning and synthesizes diverse training data to help LLMs effectively identify and reject malicious instructions regardless of source or position in context.

Result: Experimental results across four LLMs show that InstruCoT significantly outperforms baselines in all three evaluation dimensions (Behavior Deviation, Privacy Leakage, and Harmful Output) while maintaining utility performance without degradation.

Conclusion: InstruCoT effectively addresses major security vulnerabilities in LLM-integrated applications by providing a robust defense mechanism against diverse prompt injection attacks, enhancing security without compromising utility.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-integrated applications have become increasingly prevalent, yet face critical security vulnerabilities from prompt injection (PI) attacks. Defending against PI attacks faces two major issues: malicious instructions can be injected through diverse vectors, and injected instructions often lack clear semantic boundaries from the surrounding context, making them difficult to identify. To address these issues, we propose InstruCoT, a model enhancement method for PI defense that synthesizes diverse training data and employs instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning, enabling LLMs to effectively identify and reject malicious instructions regardless of their source or position in the context. We evaluate InstruCoT across three critical dimensions: Behavior Deviation, Privacy Leakage, and Harmful Output. Experimental results across four LLMs demonstrate that InstruCoT significantly outperforms baselines in all dimensions while maintaining utility performance without degradation

TL;DR: LLM-guided semantic instantiation framework for SMT solving that reduces search space for quantified formulas with uninterpreted functions over non-linear real arithmetic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quantifier instantiation methods struggle with quantified formulas over non-linear real arithmetic because they lack semantic understanding of UF constraints, forcing unbounded search with limited guidance.

Method: Preprocesses formulas through constraint separation, uses structured prompts to extract mathematical reasoning from LLMs, and integrates results with traditional SMT algorithms through adaptive instantiation with systematic validation.

Result: AquaForte solves numerous SMT-COMP benchmark instances where state-of-the-art solvers like Z3 and CVC5 timeout, with particular effectiveness on satisfiable formulas.

Conclusion: AquaForte establishes a new paradigm for SMT constraint solving by demonstrating that LLMs can provide valuable mathematical intuition for symbolic reasoning, combining learned constraints with traditional solvers to enhance overall solving capability.

Abstract: Quantified formulas with Uninterpreted Functions (UFs) over non-linear real arithmetic pose fundamental challenges for Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving. Traditional quantifier instantiation methods struggle because they lack semantic understanding of UF constraints, forcing them to search through unbounded solution spaces with limited guidance. We present AquaForte, a framework that leverages Large Language Models to provide semantic guidance for UF instantiation by generating instantiated candidates for function definitions that satisfy the constraints, thereby significantly reducing the search space and complexity for solvers. Our approach preprocesses formulas through constraint separation, uses structured prompts to extract mathematical reasoning from LLMs, and integrates the results with traditional SMT algorithms through adaptive instantiation. AquaForte maintains soundness through systematic validation: LLM-guided instantiations yielding SAT solve the original problem, while UNSAT results generate exclusion clauses for iterative refinement. Completeness is preserved by fallback to traditional solvers augmented with learned constraints. Experimental evaluation on SMT-COMP benchmarks demonstrates that AquaForte solves numerous instances where state-of-the-art solvers like Z3 and CVC5 timeout, with particular effectiveness on satisfiable formulas. Our work shows that LLMs can provide valuable mathematical intuition for symbolic reasoning, establishing a new paradigm for SMT constraint solving.

TL;DR: A two-stage framework (ResMAS) that proactively enhances resilience in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems by automatically designing resilient communication topologies and optimizing prompts based on topology awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works focus on reactive detection and mitigation of attacks, but lack proactive design of inherently resilient systems. The study found that communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) training a reward model to predict MAS resilience and training a topology generator via reinforcement learning, (2) topology-aware prompt optimization that refines agent prompts based on connections and interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments show our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. The framework demonstrates strong generalization to new tasks and models.

Conclusion: Our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-based MAS), where multiple LLM agents collaborate to solve complex tasks, have shown impressive performance in many areas. However, MAS are typically distributed across different devices or environments, making them vulnerable to perturbations such as agent failures. While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. Moreover, our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs.

TL;DR: Tape is a benchmark using cellular automata to study OOD failure in RL under rule shifts, showing ID-strong methods can fail OOD and stable rankings need sufficient replication due to high variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To isolate and study out-of-distribution (OOD) failure under latent rule shifts in reinforcement learning, ensuring fixed observation and action spaces while transition rules change.

Method: Tape uses 1D cellular automata to create precise train/test splits with fixed observation/action spaces but changing transition rules, comparing model-free, model-based planning with learned world models, and task-inference (meta-RL) methods via a reproducible pipeline.

Result: Methods strong in-distribution (ID) can collapse under heldout-rule OOD, and high-variance OOD evaluation makes rankings unstable unless sufficiently replicated.

Conclusion: The paper provides standardized OOD evaluation protocols and statistical reporting requirements, clarifying that uncertainty reduction objectives have limited guarantees under rule shifts, and that high-variance OOD evaluation necessitates sufficient replication for stable rankings.

Abstract: We present Tape, a controlled reinforcement-learning benchmark designed to isolate out-of-distribution (OOD) failure under latent rule shifts.Tape is derived from one-dimensional cellular automata, enabling precise train/test splits where observation and action spaces are held fixed while transition rules change. Using a reproducible evaluation pipeline, we compare model-free baselines, model-based planning with learned world models, and task-inference (meta-RL) methods. A consistent pattern emerges: methods that are strong in-distribution (ID) can collapse under heldout-rule OOD, and high-variance OOD evaluation can make rankings unstable unless experiments are sufficiently replicated.We provide (i) standardized OOD protocols, (ii) statistical reporting requirements (seeds, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests), and (iii) information-theoretic identities connecting entropy reduction to conditional mutual information and expected posterior KL divergence, clarifying what "uncertainty reduction" objectives can and cannot guarantee under rule shifts.

Abstract: In the process of digital transformation, enterprises are faced with problems such as insufficient semantic understanding of unstructured data and lack of intelligent decision-making basis in driving mechanisms. This study proposes a method that combines a large language model (LLM) and a knowledge graph. First, a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to perform entity recognition and relationship extraction on multi-source heterogeneous texts, and GPT-4 is used to generate semantically enhanced vector representations; secondly, a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) architecture is designed to fuse the semantic vectors output by LLM with business metadata to construct a dynamic and scalable enterprise knowledge graph; then reinforcement learning is introduced to optimize decision path generation, and the reward function is used to drive the mechanism iteration. In the case of the manufacturing industry, this mechanism reduced the response time for equipment failure scenarios from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours, the F1 value reached 94.3%, and the compensation for decision errors in the annual digital transformation cost decreased by 45.3%. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level and execution efficiency of the digital transformation driving mechanism by integrating large model semantic understanding with structured knowledge.

TL;DR: TourPlanner introduces multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning to overcome limitations in travel planning, achieving superior performance in feasibility and preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing travel planning approaches face three key challenges: (1) Pruning candidate POIs while maintaining high recall, (2) Single reasoning path restricts solution space exploration, and (3) Difficulty in simultaneously optimizing hard and soft constraints.

Method: TourPlanner is a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning, including Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) for candidate POI construction, Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) for multi-path reasoning, and sigmoid-based gating in RL for dynamic constraint prioritization.

Result: Experimental results on travel planning benchmarks show TourPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both feasibility and user-preference alignment.

Conclusion: TourPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance in travel planning, significantly surpassing existing methods in both feasibility and user-preference alignment by addressing the core challenges of candidate POI pruning, restricted reasoning exploration, and constraint optimization.

Abstract: Travel planning is a sophisticated decision-making process that requires synthesizing multifaceted information to construct itineraries. However, existing travel planning approaches face several challenges: (1) Pruning candidate points of interest (POIs) while maintaining a high recall rate; (2) A single reasoning path restricts the exploration capability within the feasible solution space for travel planning; (3) Simultaneously optimizing hard constraints and soft constraints remains a significant difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first introduce a Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) workflow to construct spatially-aware candidate POIs' set. Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met. Experimental results on travel planning benchmarks demonstrate that TourPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both feasibility and user-preference alignment.

TL;DR: M-ASK is a multi-agent framework that separates search behavior and knowledge management roles to address structural bottlenecks in agentic search systems, achieving better accuracy and training stability on complex information seeking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic search systems rely on monolithic agents that suffer from structural bottlenecks including unconstrained reasoning outputs that inflate trajectories, sparse outcome-level rewards that complicate credit assignment, and stochastic search noise that destabilizes learning.

Method: M-ASK decouples agentic search into two agent types: Search Behavior Agents for planning and executing search actions, and Knowledge Management Agents for aggregating, filtering, and maintaining internal context. It uses turn-level rewards for granular supervision of search decisions and knowledge updates.

Result: Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show that M-ASK outperforms strong baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy and significantly more stable training dynamics.

Conclusion: M-ASK is a promising framework for agentic search, achieving superior accuracy and stable training through multi-agent decomposition and turn-level rewards.

Abstract: Agentic search has emerged as a promising paradigm for complex information seeking by enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to interleave reasoning with tool use. However, prevailing systems rely on monolithic agents that suffer from structural bottlenecks, including unconstrained reasoning outputs that inflate trajectories, sparse outcome-level rewards that complicate credit assignment, and stochastic search noise that destabilizes learning. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{M-ASK} (Multi-Agent Search and Knowledge), a framework that explicitly decouples agentic search into two complementary roles: Search Behavior Agents, which plan and execute search actions, and Knowledge Management Agents, which aggregate, filter, and maintain a compact internal context. This decomposition allows each agent to focus on a well-defined subtask and reduces interference between search and context construction. Furthermore, to enable stable coordination, M-ASK employs turn-level rewards to provide granular supervision for both search decisions and knowledge updates. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that M-ASK outperforms strong baselines, achieving not only superior answer accuracy but also significantly more stable training dynamics.\footnote{The source code for M-ASK is available at https://github.com/chenyiqun/M-ASK.}

TL;DR: Multimodal framework for cloud root cause analysis that aligns time-series data with language models via semantic compression and cross-attention, achieving 48.75% accuracy on complex failure scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have significant potential for cloud incident management but face incompatibility with continuous time-series data due to their discrete token-based architecture, creating a modality mismatch that current methods inadequately address.

Method: A multimodal diagnostic framework with three technical advances: (1) semantic compression for temporal segments, (2) alignment encoder with gated cross-attention for projecting time-series into language model latent space, and (3) retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline that combines aligned embeddings with historical incident knowledge.

Result: Achieved leading performance across six cloud system benchmarks with 48.75% diagnostic accuracy, showing notable improvements on scenarios involving compound failure modes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enables language models to reason over multimodal telemetry data, achieving 48.75% diagnostic accuracy with particular strength in handling compound failure modes.

Abstract: Root cause analysis in modern cloud infrastructure demands sophisticated understanding of heterogeneous data sources, particularly time-series performance metrics that involve core failure signatures. While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in textual reasoning, their discrete token-based architecture creates fundamental incompatibilities with continuous numerical sequences exhibiting temporal dependencies. Current methodologies inadequately address this modality mismatch, constraining the potential of language model-driven automation in incident management workflows. This paper presents a multimodal diagnostic framework that harmonizes time-series representations with pretrained language model embedding spaces. Our approach contributes three technical advances: (1) a semantic compression technique that distills temporal segments into single-token abstractions while preserving pattern semantics, (2) an alignment encoder utilizing gated cross-attention to project time-series features into language model latent space, and (3) a retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline that synthesizes aligned embeddings with historical incident knowledge for expert-level failure attribution. Comprehensive evaluation across six cloud system benchmarks demonstrates that our framework achieves leading performance, reaching 48.75% diagnostic accuracy with notable improvements on scenarios involving compound failure modes. The results validate embedding-space alignment as an effective strategy for enabling language models to reason over multimodal telemetry data in production incident response contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for LLMs in autonomous driving suffer from unstructured reasoning, poor generalization, and misalignment with human driving intent.

Method: A two-stage training framework: first using supervised fine-tuning with CoT explanations, then applying progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer that dynamically adjusts learning intensity based on sample complexity.

Result: ThinkDrive outperforms strong RL baselines by 1.45%, 1.95%, and 1.01% on exam, easy-exam, and accuracy metrics respectively. A 2B-parameter model trained with ThinkDrive surpasses GPT-4o by 3.28% on the exam metric.

Conclusion: ThinkDrive successfully integrates Chain-of-Thought reasoning with progressive reinforcement learning for autonomous driving, addressing limitations of existing methods and achieving superior performance over both RL baselines and larger models like GPT-4o.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) technologies, their application in the domain of autonomous driving has become increasingly widespread. However, existing methods suffer from unstructured reasoning, poor generalization, and misalignment with human driving intent. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances decision transparency, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) fails to fully exploit its potential, and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches face instability and suboptimal reasoning depth. We propose ThinkDrive, a CoT guided progressive RL fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that synergizes explicit reasoning with difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimization. Our method employs a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform SFT using CoT explanations. Then, we apply progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer that dynamically adjusts learning intensity based on sample complexity. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset. The results show that ThinkDrive outperforms strong RL baselines by 1.45%, 1.95%, and 1.01% on exam, easy-exam, and accuracy, respectively. Moreover, a 2B-parameter model trained with our method surpasses the much larger GPT-4o by 3.28% on the exam metric.

TL;DR: CompassMem is an event-centric memory framework that structures experiences into an Event Graph with logical relations, improving long-horizon reasoning in LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory methods for LLM agents are flat, similarity-based, and struggle to capture logical relationships, hindering effective reasoning over long-horizon dependencies.

Method: Proposes CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework that segments experiences into events and links them through explicit logical relations to form an Event Graph.

Result: Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA show consistent improvements in retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models.

Conclusion: CompassMem enhances long-horizon reasoning in LLM agents by organizing memory as a structured Event Graph with logical relations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent agents that reason, plan, and interact with their environments. To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models.

TL;DR: Miner introduces uncertainty-based self-supervised rewards for RL reasoning models, achieving SOTA performance without external supervision or extra costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current critic-free RL methods for large reasoning models are inefficient when training on positive homogeneous prompts (where all rollouts are correct), causing waste of rollouts due to zero advantage estimates.

Method: Miner (Mine intrinsic mastery) - a method that uses the policy's intrinsic uncertainty as a self-supervised reward signal without external supervision, auxiliary models, or additional inference cost. It features token-level focal credit assignment and adaptive advantage calibration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across six reasoning benchmarks on Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-8B base models, with up to 4.58 absolute gains in Pass@1 and 6.66 gains in Pass@K compared to GRPO, and shows superiority over other exploration enhancement methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that latent uncertainty exploitation is both necessary and sufficient for efficient and scalable RL training of reasoning models.

Abstract: Current critic-free RL methods for large reasoning models suffer from severe inefficiency when training on positive homogeneous prompts (where all rollouts are correct), resulting in waste of rollouts due to zero advantage estimates. We introduce a radically simple yet powerful solution to \uline{M}ine \uline{in}trinsic mast\uline{er}y (Miner), that repurposes the policy's intrinsic uncertainty as a self-supervised reward signal, with no external supervision, auxiliary models, or additional inference cost. Our method pioneers two key innovations: (1) a token-level focal credit assignment mechanism that dynamically amplifies gradients on critical uncertain tokens while suppressing overconfident ones, and (2) adaptive advantage calibration to seamlessly integrate intrinsic and verifiable rewards. Evaluated across six reasoning benchmarks on Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-8B base models, Miner achieves state-of-the-art performance among the other four algorithms, yielding up to \textbf{4.58} absolute gains in Pass@1 and \textbf{6.66} gains in Pass@K compared to GRPO. Comparison with other methods targeted at exploration enhancement further discloses the superiority of the two newly proposed innovations. This demonstrates that latent uncertainty exploitation is both necessary and sufficient for efficient and scalable RL training of reasoning models.

TL;DR: Safety vulnerabilities in Medical MLLMs are addressed through a Parameter-Space Intervention method that reinjects original safety knowledge during medical fine-tuning, achieving improved safety without compromising medical capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Medical Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit significant safety vulnerabilities, particularly against cross-modality jailbreak attacks, and suffer from catastrophic forgetting of safety alignment during medical fine-tuning, posing risks for real-world deployment.

Method: The authors propose a novel Parameter-Space Intervention approach that extracts intrinsic safety knowledge representations from original base models and injects them into target models during medical capability construction, coupled with a fine-grained parameter search algorithm to optimize the safety-performance trade-off.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly strengthens safety guardrails of Medical MLLMs without needing additional domain-specific safety data while minimizing degradation to core medical performance.

Conclusion: The Parameter-Space Intervention approach effectively addresses the safety vulnerabilities in Medical MLLMs by reestablishing safety alignment without requiring additional safety data and with minimal impact on medical performance, providing a practical solution for safe real-world deployment.

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Medical MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in specialized medical tasks; however, research into their safety has lagged, posing potential risks for real-world deployment. In this paper, we first establish a multidimensional evaluation framework to systematically benchmark the safety of current SOTA Medical MLLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals pervasive vulnerabilities across both general and medical-specific safety dimensions in existing models, particularly highlighting their fragility against cross-modality jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we find that the medical fine-tuning process frequently induces catastrophic forgetting of the model's original safety alignment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel "Parameter-Space Intervention" approach for efficient safety re-alignment. This method extracts intrinsic safety knowledge representations from original base models and concurrently injects them into the target model during the construction of medical capabilities. Additionally, we design a fine-grained parameter search algorithm to achieve an optimal trade-off between safety and medical performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bolsters the safety guardrails of Medical MLLMs without relying on additional domain-specific safety data, while minimizing degradation to core medical performance.

*Ben Carvell,George De Ath,Eseoghene Benjamin,Richard Everson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online action-stacking enables realistic ATC commands with small action spaces by compiling primitive actions into compound clearances, achieving comparable performance to larger action spaces while reducing instruction frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To produce realistic air traffic control commands while allowing training on a much smaller discrete action space, bridging the gap between standard RL formulations and operational ATC requirements.

Method: Policies are trained with simple incremental heading or level adjustments using Proximal Policy Optimisation on the BluebirdDT digital twin platform, together with an action-damping penalty that reduces instruction frequency. Online action-stacking compiles bursts of primitive actions into domain-appropriate compound clearances at inference time.

Result: In lateral navigation experiments, action stacking greatly reduces the number of issued instructions relative to a damped baseline and achieves comparable performance to a policy trained with a 37-dimensional action space, despite operating with only five actions.

Conclusion: Online action-stacking helps bridge a key gap between standard reinforcement learning formulations and operational ATC requirements, and provides a simple mechanism for scaling to more complex control scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce online action-stacking, an inference-time wrapper for reinforcement learning policies that produces realistic air traffic control commands while allowing training on a much smaller discrete action space. Policies are trained with simple incremental heading or level adjustments, together with an action-damping penalty that reduces instruction frequency and leads agents to issue commands in short bursts. At inference, online action-stacking compiles these bursts of primitive actions into domain-appropriate compound clearances. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation and the BluebirdDT digital twin platform, we train agents to navigate aircraft along lateral routes, manage climb and descent to target flight levels, and perform two-aircraft collision avoidance under a minimum separation constraint. In our lateral navigation experiments, action stacking greatly reduces the number of issued instructions relative to a damped baseline and achieves comparable performance to a policy trained with a 37-dimensional action space, despite operating with only five actions. These results indicate that online action-stacking helps bridge a key gap between standard reinforcement learning formulations and operational ATC requirements, and provides a simple mechanism for scaling to more complex control scenarios.

*Mustapha Hamdi,Mourad Jabou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bio-inspired energy-aware inference controller reduces processing time by 42% with minimal accuracy loss by biasing toward favorable utility-to-energy trade-offs rather than costly global optima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy efficiency is a first-order concern in AI deployment, as long-running inference can exceed training in cumulative carbon impact. The paper aims to address the significant energy costs of AI inference operations in production environments.

Method: The authors propose a bio-inspired framework that maps protein-folding energy basins to inference cost landscapes and controls execution via a decaying, closed-loop threshold mechanism. The framework admits requests only when the expected utility-to-energy trade-off is favorable, biasing operation toward local basins rather than costly global minima. They evaluate DistilBERT and ResNet-18 served through FastAPI with ONNX Runtime and NVIDIA Triton on RTX 4000 Ada GPU.

Result: The bio-controller reduces processing time by 42% compared to standard open-loop execution (0.50s vs 0.29s on A100 test set), with minimal accuracy degradation (<0.5%). The study also establishes efficiency boundaries between lightweight local serving (ORT) and managed batching (Triton).

Conclusion: The paper establishes a connection between biophysical energy models and Green MLOps, offering a practical, auditable basis for closed-loop energy-aware inference in production systems.

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a first-order concern in AI deployment, as long-running inference can exceed training in cumulative carbon impact. We propose a bio-inspired framework that maps protein-folding energy basins to inference cost landscapes and controls execution via a decaying, closed-loop threshold. A request is admitted only when the expected utility-to-energy trade-off is favorable (high confidence/utility at low marginal energy and congestion), biasing operation toward the first acceptable local basin rather than pursuing costly global minima. We evaluate DistilBERT and ResNet-18 served through FastAPI with ONNX Runtime and NVIDIA Triton on an RTX 4000 Ada GPU. Our ablation study reveals that the bio-controller reduces processing time by 42% compared to standard open-loop execution (0.50s vs 0.29s on A100 test set), with a minimal accuracy degradation (<0.5%). Furthermore, we establish the efficiency boundaries between lightweight local serving (ORT) and managed batching (Triton). The results connect biophysical energy models to Green MLOps and offer a practical, auditable basis for closed-loop energy-aware inference in production.

### [62] [Safety-Utility Conflicts Are Not Global: Surgical Alignment via Head-Level Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04262)
*Wang Cai,Yilin Wen,Jinchang Hou,Du Su,Guoqiu Wang,Zhonghou Lv,Chenfu Bao,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAST is a conflict-aware sparse tuning framework that selectively updates LLM parameters by diagnosing and avoiding high-conflict attention heads, reducing general capability degradation while maintaining safety during alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment strategies in LLMs use global gradient geometry approaches that overlook modular heterogeneity within Transformers, where functional sensitivity and degree of conflict vary substantially across different attention heads, leading to suboptimal trade-offs by indiscriminately updating utility-sensitive heads with intense gradient conflicts.

Method: CAST integrates head-level diagnosis with sparse fine-tuning by constructing a pre-alignment conflict map that synthesizes optimization conflict and functional sensitivity, then selectively updates parameters while skipping high-conflict attention heads during training.

Result: Experiments show that alignment conflicts in LLMs are not uniformly distributed, and the drop in general capabilities mainly comes from updating a small group of high-conflict heads. By skipping these heads during training, the loss in general capabilities is significantly reduced without compromising safety.

Conclusion: The proposed Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST) framework provides an interpretable and parameter-efficient approach to improve safety-utility trade-offs in LLM alignment by avoiding updates to high-conflict attention heads, which significantly reduces the degradation of general capabilities while maintaining safety levels.

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently presents a multi-objective optimization conflict, often accompanied by an unintended degradation of general capabilities. Existing mitigation strategies typically rely on global gradient geometry to resolve these conflicts, yet they overlook Modular Heterogeneity within Transformers, specifically that the functional sensitivity and degree of conflict vary substantially across different attention heads. Such global approaches impose uniform update rules across all parameters, often resulting in suboptimal trade-offs by indiscriminately updating utility sensitive heads that exhibit intense gradient conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST), a framework that integrates head-level diagnosis with sparse fine-tuning. CAST first constructs a pre-alignment conflict map by synthesizing Optimization Conflict and Functional Sensitivity, which then guides the selective update of parameters. Experiments reveal that alignment conflicts in LLMs are not uniformly distributed. We find that the drop in general capabilities mainly comes from updating a small group of ``high-conflict'' heads. By simply skipping these heads during training, we significantly reduce this loss without compromising safety, offering an interpretable and parameter-efficient approach to improving the safety-utility trade-off.

### [63] [Learning to Reason: Temporal Saliency Distillation for Interpretable Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04263)
*Nilushika Udayangani Hewa Dehigahawattage,Kishor Nandakishor,Marimuthu Palaniswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Temporal Saliency Distillation for time series knowledge distillation that transfers both predictive accuracy and reasoning patterns by capturing temporal saliency from teacher logits, enabling interpretable knowledge transfer and safe model substitution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge distillation methods for time series are adapted from computer vision and fail to account for temporal data characteristics. They are uninterpretable, transfer limited knowledge, and result in student models with significantly different predictive distributions from teachers, preventing safe substitution.

Method: Extends conventional logit transfer to capture temporal saliency - the importance of each input timestep to the teacher's prediction, enabling the student to learn both correct predictions and correct reasoning.

Result: Temporal Saliency Distillation effectively improves baseline methods' performance and achieves desirable properties beyond predictive accuracy, enabling student models to produce more teacher-like predictive distributions.

Conclusion: Temporal Saliency Distillation establishes a new paradigm for interpretable knowledge distillation in time series analysis, enabling student models to not only match teacher predictive accuracy but also adopt analogous reasoning patterns for safe substitution.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has proven effective for model compression by transferring knowledge from a larger network called the teacher to a smaller network called the student. Current knowledge distillation in time series is predominantly based on logit and feature aligning techniques originally developed for computer vision tasks. These methods do not explicitly account for temporal data and fall short in two key aspects. First, the mechanisms by which the transferred knowledge helps the student model learning process remain unclear due to uninterpretability of logits and features. Second, these methods transfer only limited knowledge, primarily replicating the teacher predictive accuracy. As a result, student models often produce predictive distributions that differ significantly from those of their teachers, hindering their safe substitution for teacher models. In this work, we propose transferring interpretable knowledge by extending conventional logit transfer to convey not just the right prediction but also the right reasoning of the teacher. Specifically, we induce other useful knowledge from the teacher logits termed temporal saliency which captures the importance of each input timestep to the teacher prediction. By training the student with Temporal Saliency Distillation we encourage it to make predictions based on the same input features as the teacher. Temporal Saliency Distillation requires no additional parameters or architecture specific assumptions. We demonstrate that Temporal Saliency Distillation effectively improves the performance of baseline methods while also achieving desirable properties beyond predictive accuracy. We hope our work establishes a new paradigm for interpretable knowledge distillation in time series analysis.

*Nilushika Udayangani,Kishor Nandakishor,Marimuthu Palaniswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemKD is a novel knowledge distillation framework for time series models that captures memory retention discrepancies between teacher and student models, enabling more efficient deployment in resource-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for time series analysis (like RNNs and LSTMs) have high computational complexity that prevents their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Current Knowledge Distillation methods, designed for computer vision, fail to consider the temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics unique to time series models.

Method: The authors propose Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD), which employs a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between teacher and student models across time series subsequences.

Result: MemKD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods, reducing parameter size and memory usage by approximately 500 times while maintaining comparable performance to the teacher model.

Conclusion: The proposed Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD) framework provides an effective solution for deploying high-performing RNNs in resource-constrained environments by addressing the unique characteristics of time series models that were neglected by existing KD methods.

Abstract: Deep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks and their variants, such as long short-term memory, have significantly advanced time series data analysis. These models capture complex, sequential patterns in time series, enabling real-time assessments. However, their high computational complexity and large model sizes pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as wearable devices and edge computing platforms. Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), thereby retaining high performance while reducing computational demands. Current KD methods, originally designed for computer vision tasks, neglect the unique temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics of time series models. To this end, we propose a novel KD framework termed Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD). MemKD leverages a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between the teacher and student models across subsequences within time series data, ensuring that the student model effectively mimics the teacher model's behaviour. This approach facilitates the development of compact, high-performing recurrent neural networks suitable for real-time, time series analysis tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MemKD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods. It reduces parameter size and memory usage by approximately 500 times while maintaining comparable performance to the teacher model.

*Pritthijit Nath,Sebastian Schemm,Henry Moss,Peter Haynes,Emily Shuckburgh,Mark J. Webb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL framework successfully learns adaptive parametrisations online, outperforming traditional static methods across multiple climate model testbeds, with federated multi-agent approaches enabling geographic specialisation and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional parametrisation schemes rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to underlying physics. There is a need for more adaptive, physics-aware parametrisations.

Method: Used reinforcement learning (RL) with nine algorithms including TQC, DDPG, and TD3 to learn parametrisation components online as a function of evolving model state. Evaluated across idealised testbeds including simple climate bias correction (SCBC), radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings.

Result: TQC, DDPG, and TD3 achieved highest skill and most stable convergence. Single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning with strongest gains in tropical and mid-latitude bands. Federated RL enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with six-agent DDPG configuration achieving lowest area-weighted RMSE. Learned corrections were physically meaningful, reducing meridional biases and adjusting lapse rates to match vertical temperature errors.

Conclusion: RL offers a scalable pathway for online learning within numerical models, delivering skilful state-dependent and regime-aware parametrisations that outperform traditional static tuning methods.

Abstract: Weather and climate models rely on parametrisations to represent unresolved sub-grid processes. Traditional schemes rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to the underlying physics. This study presents a framework that learns components of parametrisation schemes online as a function of the evolving model state using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluates the resulting RL-driven parameter updates across a hierarchy of idealised testbeds spanning a simple climate bias correction (SCBC), a radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and a zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings. Across nine RL algorithms, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) achieved the highest skill and the most stable convergence across configurations, with performance assessed against a static baseline using area-weighted RMSE, temperature profile and pressure-level diagnostics. For the EBM, single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning with the strongest gains in tropical and mid-latitude bands, while federated RL on multi-agent setups enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with a six-agent DDPG configuration using frequent aggregation yielding the lowest area-weighted RMSE across the tropics and mid-latitudes. The learnt corrections were also physically meaningful as agents modulated EBM radiative parameters to reduce meridional biases, adjusted RCE lapse rates to match vertical temperature errors, and stabilised SCBC heating increments to limit drift. Overall, results highlight RL to deliver skilful state-dependent, and regime-aware parametrisations, offering a scalable pathway for online learning within numerical models.

*Anherutowa Calvo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces measurable framework for predictable gradient manifolds in deep learning, showing optimization operates in low-complexity temporal regime with predictable, low-rank gradient dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the empirical observation that deep learning optimization exhibits structure not captured by worst-case gradient bounds, where gradients are temporally predictable and evolve in low-dimensional subspaces during training.

Method: Introduces two computable quantities - prediction-based path length and predictable rank - to measure gradient predictability and temporal dimension. Uses these quantities to restate classical optimization guarantees with dependence on these realistic measures rather than worst-case bounds.

Result: Across various architectures (CNNs, vision transformers, language models) and tasks, gradient trajectories are found to be locally predictable with strong low-rank structure over time, stable across architectures and optimizers.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unifying framework for understanding deep learning optimization dynamics through predictable gradient manifolds, suggesting new directions for adaptive optimizers and rank-aware algorithms based on measurable properties of training runs.

Abstract: Deep learning optimization exhibits structure that is not captured by worst-case gradient bounds. Empirically, gradients along training trajectories are often temporally predictable and evolve within a low-dimensional subspace. In this work we formalize this observation through a measurable framework for predictable gradient manifolds.
  We introduce two computable quantities: a prediction-based path length that measures how well gradients can be forecast from past information, and a predictable rank that quantifies the intrinsic temporal dimension of gradient increments. We show how classical online and nonconvex optimization guarantees can be restated so that convergence and regret depend explicitly on these quantities, rather than on worst-case variation.
  Across convolutional networks, vision transformers, language models, and synthetic control tasks, we find that gradient trajectories are locally predictable and exhibit strong low-rank structure over time. These properties are stable across architectures and optimizers, and can be diagnosed directly from logged gradients using lightweight random projections.
  Our results provide a unifying lens for understanding optimization dynamics in modern deep learning, reframing standard training as operating in a low-complexity temporal regime. This perspective suggests new directions for adaptive optimizers, rank-aware tracking, and prediction-based algorithm design grounded in measurable properties of real training runs.

*Beier Luo,Cheng Wang,Hongxin Wei,Sharon Li,Xuefeng Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised post-hoc framework Dual-Align corrects both confidence and process drift in post-trained LLMs through dual alignment, improving calibration without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training worsens calibration in LLMs, causing systematic overconfidence, and existing methods fail to account for inference-time dynamics arising from two types of drift: confidence drift and process drift.

Method: Dual-Align framework performs confidence alignment through final-distribution matching and process alignment by identifying divergence layers and realigning subsequent inference stability.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements over baselines, reducing calibration errors and approaching supervised oracle performance without sacrificing post-training gains.

Conclusion: Dual-Align effectively addresses both confidence and process drift, offering a single temperature parameter solution that maintains post-training performance while significantly improving calibration.

Abstract: Post-training improves large language models (LLMs) but often worsens confidence calibration, leading to systematic overconfidence. Recent unsupervised post-hoc methods for post-trained LMs (PoLMs) mitigate this by aligning PoLM confidence to that of well-calibrated pre-trained counterparts. However, framing calibration as static output-distribution matching overlooks the inference-time dynamics introduced by post-training. In particular, we show that calibration errors arise from two regimes: (i) confidence drift, where final confidence inflates despite largely consistent intermediate decision processes, and (ii) process drift, where intermediate inference pathways diverge. Guided by this diagnosis, we propose Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework for dual alignment in confidence calibration. Dual-Align performs confidence alignment to correct confidence drift via final-distribution matching, and introduces process alignment to address process drift by locating the layer where trajectories diverge and realigning the stability of subsequent inference. This dual strategy learns a single temperature parameter that corrects both drift types without sacrificing post-training performance gains. Experiments show consistent improvements over baselines, reducing calibration errors and approaching a supervised oracle.

Motivation: To solve problems like data scarcity and privacy in air transport data by generating realistic synthetic time series of airport delays.

Method: Comparison of three models: two based on state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms and one simplified Genetic Algorithm approach.

Result: The Genetic Algorithm approach generates time series almost indistinguishable from real ones while maintaining high variability, validated in delay propagation detection.

Conclusion: The paper presents a viable method for synthetic data generation in air transport, making the data available to the scientific community.

Abstract: The generation of synthetic data is receiving increasing attention from the scientific community, thanks to its ability to solve problems like data scarcity and privacy, and is starting to find applications in air transport. We here tackle the problem of generating synthetic, yet realistic, time series of delays at airports, starting from large collections of operations in Europe and the US. We specifically compare three models, two of them based on state of the art Deep Learning algorithms, and one simplified Genetic Algorithm approach. We show how the latter can generate time series that are almost indistinguishable from real ones, while maintaining a high variability. We further validate the resulting time series in a problem of detecting delay propagations between airports. We finally make the synthetic data available to the scientific community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEGATO introduces Neural ODE-based adapters for machine unlearning in generative models, enabling smooth, controllable identity forgetting without catastrophic collapse while maintaining model efficiency and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address three key challenges in existing machine unlearning methods: inefficiency (requiring full-model fine-tuning), limited controllability of forgetting intensity, and catastrophic collapse of model retention capability during the forgetting process.

Method: The authors introduce LEGATO, which augments pre-trained generators with lightweight Neural ODE adapters that enable smooth, controllable forgetting while keeping original model weights frozen. They also implement trajectory consistency constraints to prevent catastrophic collapse during unlearning.

Result: Extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain identity unlearning benchmarks show that LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids catastrophic collapse, and significantly reduces the number of fine-tuned parameters.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that modeling identity forgetting as a continuous trajectory through Neural ODEs provides a superior approach to machine unlearning in generative models, offering precise control, stability, and efficiency while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Machine unlearning has become a crucial role in enabling generative models trained on large datasets to remove sensitive, private, or copyright-protected data. However, existing machine unlearning methods face three challenges in learning to forget identity of generative models: 1) inefficient, where identity erasure requires fine-tuning all the model's parameters; 2) limited controllability, where forgetting intensity cannot be controlled and explainability is lacking; 3) catastrophic collapse, where the model's retention capability undergoes drastic degradation as forgetting progresses. Forgetting has typically been handled through discrete and unstable updates, often requiring full-model fine-tuning and leading to catastrophic collapse. In this work, we argue that identity forgetting should be modeled as a continuous trajectory, and introduce LEGATO - Learn to ForgEt Identity in GenerAtive Models via Trajectory-consistent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. LEGATO augments pre-trained generators with fine-tunable lightweight Neural ODE adapters, enabling smooth, controllable forgetting while keeping the original model weights frozen. This formulation allows forgetting intensity to be precisely modulated via ODE step size, offering interpretability and robustness. To further ensure stability, we introduce trajectory consistency constraints that explicitly prevent catastrophic collapse during unlearning. Extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain identity unlearning benchmarks show that LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids catastrophic collapse and reduces fine-tuned parameters.

*Nikolay Yudin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Character-level Transformers trained on modular addition can fail under input format variations despite high in-distribution accuracy; a simple training recipe improves robustness to position shifts and template changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research addresses the issue that models achieving high in-distribution accuracy can fail catastrophically when the same expression is shifted to different absolute character positions or presented under out-of-distribution natural-language templates, identifying a previously under-emphasized failure mode in robustness under input-format variation.

Method: The authors trained character-level Transformers on modular addition from text and introduced a training recipe with four components: (i) explicit expression boundary markers, (ii) position curriculum to broaden absolute positions seen during training, (iii) diverse template mixtures, and (iv) consistency training across multiple variants per example. They used a disjoint-pair split over all ordered pairs for p=97 and compared against a baseline model and an ALiBi-style ablation.

Result: The proposed training intervention substantially improved robustness to position shift and template OOD across three seeds while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, whereas the baseline model collapsed under these conditions and the ALiBi-style ablation failed to learn the task.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a simple training recipe combining boundary markers, position curriculum, diverse templates, and consistency training can significantly improve robustness to position shift and template OOD while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, suggesting that explicitly training invariances is beneficial for procedural generalization under noisy supervision.

Abstract: Building on insights from the grokking literature, we study character-level Transformers trained to compute modular addition from text, and focus on robustness under input-format variation rather than only in-distribution accuracy. We identify a previously under-emphasized failure mode: models that achieve high in-distribution accuracy can fail catastrophically when the same expression is shifted to different absolute character positions ("position shift") or presented under out-of-distribution natural-language templates. Using a disjoint-pair split over all ordered pairs for p=97, we show that a baseline model reaches strong in-distribution performance yet collapses under position shift and template OOD. We then introduce a simple training recipe that combines (i) explicit expression boundary markers, (ii) position curriculum that broadens the range of absolute positions seen during training, (iii) diverse template mixtures, and (iv) consistency training across multiple variants per example. Across three seeds, this intervention substantially improves robustness to position shift and template OOD while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, whereas an ALiBi-style ablation fails to learn the task under our setup. Our results suggest that steering procedural generalization under noisy supervision benefits from explicitly training invariances that are otherwise absent from the data distribution, and we provide a reproducible evaluation protocol and artifacts.

*Niklas Kueper,Kartik Chari,Elsa Andrea Kirchner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Classifier ensembles and sliding-window postprocessing enhance asynchronous EEG movement intention detection, achieving better online performance than single models and reducing false detections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke is a leading cause of disabilities, and extending rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy requires detecting patient's movement intention from EEG signals, which is challenging to decode in online asynchronous classifications.

Method: Analyzed two EEG datasets from 14 healthy subjects performing self-initiated arm movements using offline and pseudo-online evaluations comparing ensemble combinations of SVM, MLP, and EEGNet classification models with sliding-window postprocessing.

Result: In pseudo-online evaluation, two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for optimal postprocessing windows; increased postprocessing windows significantly improved single model performance; no significant improvements between best single model and ensembles in offline evaluation.

Conclusion: Classifier ensembles and sliding-window postprocessing effectively enhance asynchronous detection of movement intentions from EEG signals for robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation, particularly improving online classification performance and reducing false detections.

Abstract: Objective: Stroke is one of the leading causes of disabilities. One promising approach is to extend the rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy. To enable this, it is required to detect the patient's intention to move to trigger the assistance of a robotic device. This intention to move can be detected from human surface electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, it is particularly challenging to decode when classifications are performed online and asynchronously. In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows. In particular, for single models, an increased number of postprocessing windows significantly improved classification performances. Interestingly, we found no significant improvements between performances of the best single model and classifier ensembles in the offline evaluation. Significance: We demonstrated that classifier ensembles and appropriate postprocessing methods effectively enhance the asynchronous detection of movement intentions from EEG signals. In particular, the classifier ensemble approach yields greater improvements in online classification than in offline classification, and reduces false detections, i.e., early false positives.

TL;DR: ArtCognition uses digital drawing (HTP test) with multimodal analysis (visual + behavioral cues) and RAG for enhanced psychological assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of objective assessment of human affective and psychological states through non-verbal channels by leveraging digital drawing as an underexplored modality.

Method: We developed a multimodal framework called ArtCognition that combines static visual features from the final HTP drawing with dynamic behavioral kinematic cues from the drawing process, using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture for interpretability.

Result: Fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues yielded more nuanced assessments than single modalities, with significant correlations between multimodal features and standardized psychological metrics.

Conclusion: Digital drawing via the ArtCognition framework provides a non-intrusive and scalable tool for affective state assessment, bridging computational analysis with clinical psychological insights.

Abstract: The objective assessment of human affective and psychological states presents a significant challenge, particularly through non-verbal channels. This paper introduces digital drawing as a rich and underexplored modality for affective sensing. We present a novel multimodal framework, named ArtCognition, for the automated analysis of the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test, a widely used psychological instrument. ArtCognition uniquely fuses two distinct data streams: static visual features from the final artwork, captured by computer vision models, and dynamic behavioral kinematic cues derived from the drawing process itself, such as stroke speed, pauses, and smoothness. To bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level psychological interpretation, we employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This grounds the analysis in established psychological knowledge, enhancing explainability and reducing the potential for model hallucination. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues provides a more nuanced assessment than either modality alone. We show significant correlations between the extracted multimodal features and standardized psychological metrics, validating the framework's potential as a scalable tool to support clinicians. This work contributes a new methodology for non-intrusive affective state assessment and opens new avenues for technology-assisted mental healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explainable deep learning framework using multimodal temporal embeddings reveals five distinct metabolic phenotypes in type 1 diabetes, enabling improved risk stratification beyond conventional biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Type 1 diabetes is highly metabolically heterogeneous and cannot be adequately characterized by conventional biomarkers like HbA1c, requiring more comprehensive approaches to understand metabolic status and risk stratification.

Method: An explainable deep learning framework integrating CGM data with laboratory profiles using transformer encoders for temporal dependencies and Gaussian mixture modeling for latent phenotype identification, with interpretability through attention visualization and SHAP analysis.

Result: Identified five latent metabolic phenotypes ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk in 577 T1D individuals, with distinct biochemical profiles including glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and TSH levels. Glucose variability emerged as dominant temporal factor, while HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, and TSH were key phenotype differentiators with modest associations to cardiovascular conditions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully identified physiologically coherent metabolic subgroups in T1D and supports risk stratification beyond single biomarkers, revealing modest associations with cardiovascular conditions.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a highly metabolically heterogeneous disease that cannot be adequately characterized by conventional biomarkers such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework that integrates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with laboratory profiles to learn multimodal temporal embeddings of individual metabolic status. Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Attention analysis highlights glucose variability as a dominant temporal factor, while SHAP analysis identifies HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, and TSH as key contributors to phenotype differentiation. Phenotype membership shows statistically significant, albeit modest, associations with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Overall, this explainable multimodal temporal embedding framework reveals physiologically coherent metabolic subgroups in T1D and supports risk stratification beyond single biomarkers.

### [74] [Quantifying the Effect of Test Set Contamination on Generative Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04301)
*Rylan Schaeffer,Joshua Kazdan,Baber Abbasi,Ken Ziyu Liu,Brando Miranda,Ahmed Ahmed,Abhay Puri,Niloofar Mireshghallah,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Test set contamination significantly boosts generative model performance, with surprising scaling law effects and complex interactions between generation and memorization throughout the model lifecycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited research on how test set contamination affects generative evaluations compared to discriminative evaluations, despite contamination being a critical concern for accurately assessing frontier AI system capabilities.

Method: The researchers pretrained language models on mixtures of web data and the MATH benchmark, varying model sizes and number of test set replicas in pretraining corpus. They studied scaling laws, further training (overtraining with fresh data vs supervised finetuning), and inference factors like temperature and solution length.

Result: Performance improves with both contamination and model size. Including even one test set replica allows models to achieve lower loss than irreducible error of uncontaminated training. Overtraining reduces contamination effects, while supervised finetuning can increase or decrease performance depending on pretraining contamination levels. High sampling temperatures and longer solutions mitigate memorization effects during inference.

Conclusion: Test set contamination significantly affects generative evaluations and adds complexity to trustworthy AI system evaluation, requiring careful consideration throughout the model lifecycle.

Abstract: As frontier AI systems are pretrained on web-scale data, test set contamination has become a critical concern for accurately assessing their capabilities. While research has thoroughly investigated the impact of test set contamination on discriminative evaluations like multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has studied the impact of test set contamination on generative evaluations. In this work, we quantitatively assess the effect of test set contamination on generative evaluations through the language model lifecycle. We pretrain language models on mixtures of web data and the MATH benchmark, sweeping model sizes and number of test set replicas contaminating the pretraining corpus; performance improves with contamination and model size. Using scaling laws, we make a surprising discovery: including even a single test set replica enables models to achieve lower loss than the irreducible error of training on the uncontaminated corpus. We then study further training: overtraining with fresh data reduces the effects of contamination, whereas supervised finetuning on the training set can either increase or decrease performance on test data, depending on the amount of pretraining contamination. Finally, at inference, we identify factors that modulate memorization: high sampling temperatures mitigate contamination effects, and longer solutions are exponentially more difficult to memorize than shorter ones, presenting a contrast with discriminative evaluations, where solutions are only a few tokens in length. By characterizing how generation and memorization interact, we highlight a new layer of complexity for trustworthy evaluation of AI systems.

*Mohammad Ali Javidian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causal domain adaptation method that imputes missing target variables by learning compact, mechanism-stable representations using Gaussian Information Bottleneck for linear Gaussian models and Variational Information Bottleneck for nonlinear cases, achieving accurate zero-shot imputations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the domain adaptation setting in causal systems where the target variable is observed in the source domain but entirely missing in the target domain. The goal is to impute the missing target variable in the target domain from remaining observed variables under various shifts.

Method: For linear Gaussian causal models, a closed-form Gaussian Information Bottleneck (GIB) solution is derived, which reduces to a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-style projection with optional DAG-awareness. For nonlinear or non-Gaussian data, a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) encoder-predictor is introduced that scales to high dimensions and can be trained on source data for zero-shot deployment to the target domain.

Result: The approach consistently attains accurate imputations across synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The approach presents a unified and lightweight toolkit for causal domain adaptation. It achieves accurate imputations across diverse datasets, supporting practical use in high-dimensional causal models.

Abstract: We tackle a common domain adaptation setting in causal systems. In this setting, the target variable is observed in the source domain but is entirely missing in the target domain. We aim to impute the target variable in the target domain from the remaining observed variables under various shifts. We frame this as learning a compact, mechanism-stable representation. This representation preserves information relevant for predicting the target while discarding spurious variation. For linear Gaussian causal models, we derive a closed-form Gaussian Information Bottleneck (GIB) solution. This solution reduces to a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-style projection and offers Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-aware options when desired. For nonlinear or non-Gaussian data, we introduce a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) encoder-predictor. This approach scales to high dimensions and can be trained on source data and deployed zero-shot to the target domain. Across synthetic and real datasets, our approach consistently attains accurate imputations, supporting practical use in high-dimensional causal models and furnishing a unified, lightweight toolkit for causal domain adaptation.

### [76] [Phasor Agents: Oscillatory Graphs with Three-Factor Plasticity and Sleep-Staged Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04362)
*Rodja Trappe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Phasor Agents use coupled oscillators as a representational medium with three-factor plasticity. Wake/sleep separation prevents instability, enabling improved learning, replay, and latent learning without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address stability challenges in oscillatory substrates where online weight updates can cause unwanted regimes like global synchrony, collapsing representational diversity, by separating wake tagging from offline consolidation.

Method: The paper proposes Phasor Agents using Phasor Graphs of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. Learning is achieved via three-factor local plasticity (eligibility traces gated by global modulators) without backpropagation, and wake/sleep separation (deep-sleep gated capture and REM replay) for stability.

Result: Results show eligibility traces preserve credit, compression-progress signals pass controls, phase-coherent retrieval reaches 4x baselines, wake/sleep separation expands stable learning by 67%, REM replay improves maze success by +45.5 percentage points, and Tolman-style latent learning emerges.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Phasor Agents with oscillatory substrates can achieve stable and efficient learning through wake/sleep separation and replay mechanisms, demonstrating significant improvements in various tasks and validating the biological plausibility of the approach.

Abstract: Phasor Agents are dynamical systems whose internal state is a Phasor Graph: a weighted graph of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. A Stuart-Landau oscillator is a minimal stable "rhythm generator" (the normal form near a Hopf bifurcation); each oscillator is treated as an abstract computational unit (inspired by, but not claiming to model, biological oscillatory populations). In this interpretation, oscillator phase tracks relative timing (coherence), while amplitude tracks local gain or activity. Relative phase structure serves as a representational medium; coupling weights are learned via three-factor local plasticity - eligibility traces gated by sparse global modulators and oscillation-timed write windows - without backpropagation.
  A central challenge in oscillatory substrates is stability: online weight updates can drive the network into unwanted regimes (e.g., global synchrony), collapsing representational diversity. We therefore separate wake tagging from offline consolidation, inspired by synaptic tagging-and-capture and sleep-stage dynamics: deep-sleep-like gated capture commits tagged changes safely, while REM-like replay reconstructs and perturbs experience for planning.
  A staged experiment suite validates each mechanism with ablations and falsifiers: eligibility traces preserve credit under delayed modulation; compression-progress signals pass timestamp-shuffle controls; phase-coherent retrieval reaches 4x diffusive baselines under noise; wake/sleep separation expands stable learning by 67 percent under matched weight-norm budgets; REM replay improves maze success rate by +45.5 percentage points; and a Tolman-style latent-learning signature - immediate competence and detour advantage after unrewarded exploration, consistent with an internal model - emerges from replay (Tolman, 1948).
  The codebase and all artifacts are open-source.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Programmatic policies outperform neural policies in evolutionary reinforcement learning, with better survival and interpretability in artificial life environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether programmatic policies (PERL) can match the performance of neural network policies (NERL) in evolutionary reinforcement learning, addressing the lack of explicit modular structure in neural representations that limits behavioral interpretation.

Method: Used soft, differentiable decision lists (SDDL) for programmatic policies and conducted survival analysis across 4000 independent trials using Kaplan-Meier curves and Restricted Mean Survival Time metrics.

Result: PERL agents survived on average 201.69 steps longer than NERL agents, and SDDL agents using learning alone survived on average 73.67 steps longer than neural agents using both learning and evolution.

Conclusion: Programmatic policies can exceed the survival performance of neural policies in ALife, showing that structured representations offer advantages in evolutionary reinforcement learning.

Abstract: In evolutionary reinforcement learning tasks (ERL), agent policies are often encoded as small artificial neural networks (NERL). Such representations lack explicit modular structure, limiting behavioral interpretation. We investigate whether programmatic policies (PERL), implemented as soft, differentiable decision lists (SDDL), can match the performance of NERL. To support reproducible evaluation, we provide the first fully specified and open-source reimplementation of the classic 1992 Artificial Life (ALife) ERL testbed. We conduct a rigorous survival analysis across 4000 independent trials utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves and Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) metrics absent in the original study. We find a statistically significant difference in survival probability between PERL and NERL. PERL agents survive on average 201.69 steps longer than NERL agents. Moreover, SDDL agents using learning alone (no evolution) survive on average 73.67 steps longer than neural agents using both learning and evaluation. These results demonstrate that programmatic policies can exceed the survival performance of neural policies in ALife.

TL;DR: PiNets provide aligned and faithful explanations in deep learning by using pseudo-linear networks to produce instance-wise linear predictions in any feature space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature attribution methods loosely reflect model predictions, serving as post-hoc rationalizations rather than directly linking explanations to predictions, which undermines trustworthiness.

Method: PiNets are pseudo-linear networks that generate instance-wise linear predictions in any feature space, ensuring linear readability.

Result: PiNets demonstrate faithful explanations across multiple criteria in image classification and segmentation tasks, achieving explanatory alignment.

Conclusion: PiNets enable faithful and aligned explanations by producing instance-wise linear predictions in arbitrary feature spaces, making them linearly readable.

Abstract: Feature attribution is the dominant paradigm for explaining deep neural networks. However, most existing methods only loosely reflect the model's prediction-making process, thereby merely white-painting the black box. We argue that explanatory alignment is a key aspect of trustworthiness in prediction tasks: explanations must be directly linked to predictions, rather than serving as post-hoc rationalizations. We present model readability as a design principle enabling alignment, and PiNets as a modeling framework to pursue it in a deep learning context. PiNets are pseudo-linear networks that produce instance-wise linear predictions in an arbitrary feature space, making them linearly readable. We illustrate their use on image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrating how PiNets produce explanations that are faithful across multiple criteria in addition to alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a reinforcement learning approach that maintains competitive performance while offering interpretability and computational efficiency, particularly for safety-critical applications with transparency and resource constraints.

Method: Integrates Fuzzified Eligibility Traces (FET) and Segmented Experience Replay (SER) into fuzzy Q-learning with Fuzzified Bellman Equation (FBE), using interpretable fuzzy rule base instead of neural networks.

Result: Achieves superior sample efficiency and reduced variance compared to n-step fuzzy TD and fuzzy SARSA(λ) baselines, with substantially lower computational complexity than deep RL alternatives like DDPG.

Conclusion: Enhanced-FQL(λ) provides a theoretically sound and computationally efficient fuzzy reinforcement learning framework suitable for safety-critical applications, offering interpretability, low complexity, and competitive performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces a fuzzy reinforcement learning framework, Enhanced-FQL($λ$), that integrates novel Fuzzified Eligibility Traces (FET) and Segmented Experience Replay (SER) into fuzzy Q-learning with Fuzzified Bellman Equation (FBE) for continuous control tasks. The proposed approach employs an interpretable fuzzy rule base instead of complex neural architectures, while maintaining competitive performance through two key innovations: a fuzzified Bellman equation with eligibility traces for stable multi-step credit assignment, and a memory-efficient segment-based experience replay mechanism for enhanced sample efficiency. Theoretical analysis proves the proposed method convergence under standard assumptions. Extensive evaluations in continuous control domains demonstrate that Enhanced-FQL($λ$) achieves superior sample efficiency and reduced variance compared to n-step fuzzy TD and fuzzy SARSA($λ$) baselines, while maintaining substantially lower computational complexity than deep RL alternatives such as DDPG. The framework's inherent interpretability, combined with its computational efficiency and theoretical convergence guarantees, makes it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications where transparency and resource constraints are essential.

### [81] [Rate or Fate? RLV$^\varepsilon$R: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Noisy Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04411)
*Ali Rad,Khashayar Filom,Darioush Keivan,Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani,Ehsan Kamalinejad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Identifies a phase transition in RLVR where verification noise determines learning fate: positive Youden's index (J>0) enables learning, J=0 gives neutral dynamics, J<0 causes anti-learning collapse. Noise affects speed but not outcome when J>0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation addresses that real-world verifiers in RLVR are imperfect—unit tests cover limited cases, human/synthetic labels have errors, LLM judges are noisy—especially in challenging domains like coding where tests are sparse. The key question is whether verification noise merely slows learning or fundamentally changes outcomes.

Method: Developed an analytically tractable multi-armed bandit model of RLVR dynamics using GRPO, modeling verification errors through false positives/negatives and grouping completions into reasoning modes. This yields replicator-style dynamics that decouple into within-mode competition and evolution of incorrect mode mass.

Result: The analysis reveals a sharp phase transition driven by Youden's index J=TPR-FPR: when J>0, incorrect modes are eliminated (learning); when J=0, neutral dynamics; when J<0, incorrect modes dominate (anti-learning/collapse). Experiments on programming tasks confirm the J=0 boundary, showing noise mainly affects convergence speed when J>0, not the learning outcome.

Conclusion: The study establishes that verification noise affects learning speed but not outcome when J>0, with a clear phase transition at J=0 determining whether RLVR succeeds, remains neutral, or collapses. The analysis provides a general framework for understanding RLVR dynamics beyond noise.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a simple but powerful paradigm for training LLMs: sample a completion, verify it, and update. In practice, however, the verifier is almost never clean--unit tests probe only limited corner cases; human and synthetic labels are imperfect; and LLM judges (e.g., RLAIF) are noisy and can be exploited--and this problem worsens on harder domains (especially coding) where tests are sparse and increasingly model-generated. We ask a pragmatic question: does the verification noise merely slow down the learning (rate), or can it flip the outcome (fate)?
  To address this, we develop an analytically tractable multi-armed bandit view of RLVR dynamics, instantiated with GRPO and validated in controlled experiments. Modeling false positives and false negatives and grouping completions into recurring reasoning modes yields a replicator-style (natural-selection) flow on the probability simplex. The dynamics decouples into within-correct-mode competition and a one-dimensional evolution for the mass on incorrect modes, whose drift is determined solely by Youden's index J=TPR-FPR. This yields a sharp phase transition: when J>0, the incorrect mass is driven toward extinction (learning); when J=0, the process is neutral; and when J<0, incorrect modes amplify until they dominate (anti-learning and collapse). In the learning regime J>0, noise primarily rescales convergence time ("rate, not fate"). Experiments on verifiable programming tasks under synthetic noise reproduce the predicted J=0 boundary. Beyond noise, the framework offers a general lens for analyzing RLVR stability, convergence, and algorithmic interventions.

TL;DR: A constrained optimization framework for quantum machine unlearning using tunable target distributions and anchor-based constraints achieves better forgetting-performance balance than uniform approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour in quantum machine unlearning.

Method: A distribution-guided framework that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem, introducing a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics and incorporating an anchor-based preservation constraint.

Result: Demonstrates sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning on Iris and Covertype datasets.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of target design and constraint-based formulations for reliable and interpretable quantum machine unlearning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data from a learned model without full retraining. While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour. In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets. Results demonstrate sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with the gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning. These findings highlight the importance of target design and constraint-based formulations for reliable and interpretable quantum machine unlearning.

TL;DR: SPIN introduces a two-stage approach for RL in combinatorial action spaces: first learns valid action structure, then trains control policies, achieving better performance and faster convergence than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning for discrete combinatorial action spaces either make unrealistic independence assumptions leading to incoherent actions, or attempt joint structure-control learning which is slow and unstable.

Method: SPIN uses a two-stage framework: first pre-training an Action Structure Model (ASM) to capture valid action manifolds, then freezing this representation and training lightweight policy heads for control.

Result: On discrete DM Control benchmarks, SPIN improves average return by up to 39% over state-of-the-art methods and reduces time to convergence by up to 12.8×.

Conclusion: Structured Policy Initialization (SPIN) provides an effective solution for reinforcement learning in discrete combinatorial action spaces by separating action structure learning from control, resulting in both performance improvements and faster convergence.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in discrete combinatorial action spaces requires searching over exponentially many joint actions to simultaneously select multiple sub-actions that form coherent combinations. Existing approaches either simplify policy learning by assuming independence across sub-actions, which often yields incoherent or invalid actions, or attempt to learn action structure and control jointly, which is slow and unstable. We introduce Structured Policy Initialization (SPIN), a two-stage framework that first pre-trains an Action Structure Model (ASM) to capture the manifold of valid actions, then freezes this representation and trains lightweight policy heads for control. On challenging discrete DM Control benchmarks, SPIN improves average return by up to 39% over the state of the art while reducing time to convergence by up to 12.8$\times$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the lack of a socio-technical synthesis that systematizes concepts and provides practical guidance for addressing the unintended consequences of performative prediction in high-stakes domains.

Method: The authors conduct a Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK) by comprehensively reviewing the literature on performative prediction, identifying key mechanisms, risks, and solutions, and developing an assessment framework.

Result: The primary result is the development of the Performative Strength vs. Impact Matrix, a framework designed to help practitioners assess the influence and severity of performativity and select appropriate interventions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Performative Strength vs. Impact Matrix serves as a practical tool for practitioners to assess and address performativity risks, highlighting the need for tailored interventions based on the specific context of model deployment.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used in high-stakes domains where their predictions can actively shape the environments in which they operate, a phenomenon known as performative prediction. This dynamic, in which the deployment of the model influences the very outcome it seeks to predict, can lead to unintended consequences, including feedback loops, performance issues, and significant societal risks. While the literature in the field has grown rapidly in recent years, a socio-technical synthesis that systemises the phenomenon concepts and provides practical guidance has been lacking. This Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK) addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of the literature on performative predictions. We provide an overview of the primary mechanisms through which performativity manifests, present a typology of associated risks, and survey the proposed solutions offered in the literature. Our primary contribution is the ``Performative Strength vs. Impact Matrix" assessment framework. This practical tool is designed to help practitioners assess the potential influence and severity of performativity on their deployed predictive models and select the appropriate level of algorithmic or human intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prolonged length of stay (pLoS) is a significant factor associated with risk of adverse in-hospital events, and there is need for predictive models to identify pLoS cases.

Result: Model achieved specificity 0.83 (95% CI 0.82-0.84), sensitivity 0.64 (95% CI 0.62-0.65), accuracy 0.76 (95% CI 0.76-0.77), precision 0.67 (95% CI 0.66-0.69), and AUC-ROC 0.82 (95% CI 0.81-0.83) in validation cohort. Feature selection returned nine interpretable variables.

Conclusion: The model exhibits strong predictive performance and offers insights into factors influencing prolonged hospital stays, making it valuable for hospital management and future intervention studies aimed at reducing pLoS.

Abstract: Prolonged length of stay (pLoS) is a significant factor associated with the risk of adverse in-hospital events. We develop and explain a predictive model for pLos using admission-level patient and hospital administrative data. The approach includes a feature selection method by selecting non-correlated features with the highest information value. The method uses features weights of evidence to select a representative within cliques from graph theory. The prognosis study analyzed the records from 120,354 hospital admissions at the Hospital Alma Mater de Antioquia between January 2017 and March 2022. After a cleaning process the dataset was split into training (67%), test (22%), and validation (11%) cohorts. A logistic regression model was trained to predict the pLoS in two classes: less than or greater than 7 days. The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC metrics. The feature selection method returns nine interpretable variables, enhancing the models' transparency. In the validation cohort, the pLoS model achieved a specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82-0.84), sensitivity of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62-0.65), accuracy of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.76-0.77), precision of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.66-0.69), and AUC-ROC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.81-0.83). The model exhibits strong predictive performance and offers insights into the factors that influence prolonged hospital stays. This makes it a valuable tool for hospital management and for developing future intervention studies aimed at reducing pLoS.

Abstract: The field of learning analytics has made notable strides in automating the detection of complex learning processes in multimodal data. However, most advancements have focused on individualized problem-solving instead of collaborative, open-ended problem-solving, which may offer both affordances (richer data) and challenges (low cohesion) to behavioral prediction. Here, we extend predictive models to automatically detect socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) behaviors in collaborative computational modeling environments using embedding-based approaches. We leverage large language models (LLMs) as summarization tools to generate task-aware representations of student dialogue aligned with system logs. These summaries, combined with text-only embeddings, context-enriched embeddings, and log-derived features, were used to train predictive models. Results show that text-only embeddings often achieve stronger performance in detecting SSRL behaviors related to enactment or group dynamics (e.g., off-task behavior or requesting assistance). In contrast, contextual and multimodal features provide complementary benefits for constructs such as planning and reflection. Overall, our findings highlight the promise of embedding-based models for extending learning analytics by enabling scalable detection of SSRL behaviors, ultimately supporting real-time feedback and adaptive scaffolding in collaborative learning environments that teachers value.

TL;DR: A meta-learning approach that automatically learns probabilistic graphical model structures from multiple related datasets through hierarchical modeling and bi-level optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic graphical models require well-specified models, which is challenging and often requires iterative trial-and-error model checking and revision.

Method: Uses a hierarchical VAE-inspired architecture with bi-level optimization: local variables updated via coordinate ascent, global parameters trained with gradient-based methods.

Result: Successfully adapts generative models to data and recovers meaningful latent representations in object-centric image modeling and sequential text modeling tasks.

Conclusion: MPM enables learning generative model structures directly from multiple related datasets, overcoming the trial-and-error approach of traditional probabilistic graphical models.

Abstract: While probabilistic graphical models can discover latent structure in data, their effectiveness hinges on choosing well-specified models. Identifying such models is challenging in practice, often requiring iterative checking and revision through trial and error. To this end, we propose meta-probabilistic modeling (MPM), a meta-learning algorithm that learns generative model structure directly from multiple related datasets. MPM uses a hierarchical architecture where global model specifications are shared across datasets while local parameters remain dataset-specific. For learning and inference, we propose a tractable VAE-inspired surrogate objective, and optimize it through bi-level optimization: local variables are updated analytically via coordinate ascent, while global parameters are trained with gradient-based methods. We evaluate MPM on object-centric image modeling and sequential text modeling, demonstrating that it adapts generative models to data while recovering meaningful latent representations.

Motivation: To understand how Claude 3.5 Haiku perceives visual properties like linebreaking in fixed-width text despite only receiving token sequences.

Method: Mechanistic investigation using causal interventions and analysis of character count representations on low-dimensional curved manifolds with sparse feature families.

Result: Found that character counts are represented on discretized curved manifolds, attention heads transform these representations to estimate line boundaries, and certain visual illusions can hijack the counting mechanism.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of combining feature-based and geometric perspectives in interpretability, revealing rich sensory processing in early layers and intricate attention algorithms.

Abstract: Language models can perceive visual properties of text despite receiving only sequences of tokens-we mechanistically investigate how Claude 3.5 Haiku accomplishes one such task: linebreaking in fixed-width text. We find that character counts are represented on low-dimensional curved manifolds discretized by sparse feature families, analogous to biological place cells. Accurate predictions emerge from a sequence of geometric transformations: token lengths are accumulated into character count manifolds, attention heads twist these manifolds to estimate distance to the line boundary, and the decision to break the line is enabled by arranging estimates orthogonally to create a linear decision boundary. We validate our findings through causal interventions and discover visual illusions--character sequences that hijack the counting mechanism. Our work demonstrates the rich sensory processing of early layers, the intricacy of attention algorithms, and the importance of combining feature-based and geometric views of interpretability.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) and federated distillation (FD) are distributed learning paradigms that train UE models with enhanced privacy, each offering different trade-offs between noise robustness and learning speed. To mitigate their respective weaknesses, we propose a hybrid federated learning (HFL) framework in which each user equipment (UE) transmits either gradients or logits, and the base station (BS) selects the per-round weights of FL and FD updates. We derive convergence of HFL framework and introduce two methods to exploit degrees of freedom (DoF) in HFL, which are (i) adaptive UE clustering via Jenks optimization and (ii) adaptive weight selection via a damped Newton method. Numerical results show that HFL achieves superior test accuracy at low SNR when both DoF are exploited.

TL;DR: IGENBENCH is the first benchmark to evaluate text-to-infographic reliability, revealing major gaps in current models' ability to generate accurate data visualizations despite good aesthetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models can generate aesthetically appealing images but their reliability in generating infographics remains unclear. Generated infographics often contain subtle issues like distorted data encoding or incorrect textual content that are easily overlooked.

Method: The authors developed IGENBENCH, a benchmark with 600 test cases across 30 infographic types, and designed an automated evaluation framework that decomposes reliability verification into atomic yes/no questions. They employed multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to verify each question and evaluated 10 state-of-the-art T2I models.

Result: Systematic evaluation revealed: (i) a three-tier performance hierarchy with top model achieving Q-ACC of 0.90 but I-ACC of only 0.49; (ii) data-related dimensions (e.g., Data Completeness: 0.21) as universal bottlenecks; and (iii) the challenge of achieving end-to-end correctness across all models.

Conclusion: The research concludes that current text-to-image models face significant challenges in generating reliable infographics, with data-related dimensions being the primary bottlenecks. The top-performing model achieved only 0.49 infographic-level accuracy, highlighting the difficulty of achieving end-to-end correctness across all dimensions.

Abstract: Infographics are composite visual artifacts that combine data visualizations with textual and illustrative elements to communicate information. While recent text-to-image (T2I) models can generate aesthetically appealing images, their reliability in generating infographics remains unclear. Generated infographics may appear correct at first glance but contain easily overlooked issues, such as distorted data encoding or incorrect textual content. We present IGENBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating the reliability of text-to-infographic generation, comprising 600 curated test cases spanning 30 infographic types. We design an automated evaluation framework that decomposes reliability verification into atomic yes/no questions based on a taxonomy of 10 question types. We employ multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to verify each question, yielding question-level accuracy (Q-ACC) and infographic-level accuracy (I-ACC). We comprehensively evaluate 10 state-of-the-art T2I models on IGENBENCH. Our systematic analysis reveals key insights for future model development: (i) a three-tier performance hierarchy with the top model achieving Q-ACC of 0.90 but I-ACC of only 0.49; (ii) data-related dimensions emerging as universal bottlenecks (e.g., Data Completeness: 0.21); and (iii) the challenge of achieving end-to-end correctness across all models.

Conclusion: SurfFlow demonstrates that incorporating molecular surfaces in peptide design enhancestherapeutic peptide discovery

Abstract: Therapeutic peptides show promise in targeting previously undruggable binding sites, with recent advancements in deep generative models enabling full-atom peptide co-design for specific protein receptors. However, the critical role of molecular surfaces in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has been underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an omni-design peptides generation paradigm, called SurfFlow, a novel surface-based generative algorithm that enables comprehensive co-design of sequence, structure, and surface for peptides. SurfFlow employs a multi-modality conditional flow matching (CFM) architecture to learn distributions of surface geometries and biochemical properties, enhancing peptide binding accuracy. Evaluated on the comprehensive PepMerge benchmark, SurfFlow consistently outperforms full-atom baselines across all metrics. These results highlight the advantages of considering molecular surfaces in de novo peptide discovery and demonstrate the potential of integrating multiple protein modalities for more effective therapeutic peptide discovery.

*Jacob Ede Levine,Yun Lyan Luo,Sai Chandra Kosaraju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSSR is a two-stage RL framework that improves SMILES generation quality by rewarding token swaps for syntax repair and chemistry-aware fixes, enhancing validity and novelty without reducing diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chemical language models generating SMILES strings are vulnerable to compounding token errors, resulting in many unparseable or chemically implausible samples. Hard constraints to prevent failure can restrict exploration of chemical space.

Method: Introduces TSSR, a two-stage reinforcement learning framework for character-level SMILES generation. Stage one rewards local token swaps to repair syntax, while stage two provides chemistry-aware feedback from RDKit diagnostics. The reward system decomposes into interpretable terms and is model-agnostic.

Result: In P-RL (pure RL), TSSR significantly improves syntactic validity, chemical validity, and novelty. In F-RL (fine-tuning RL), it preserves drug-likeness and synthesizability while increasing validity and novelty. Token-level analysis shows syntax edits and chemistry fixes jointly reduce RDKit detected errors.

Conclusion: TSSR is a dataset-agnostic framework that converts sparse terminal objectives into denser, interpretable rewards, significantly improving both syntactic and chemical quality without reducing diversity. It can be adapted to various reinforcement learning approaches and requires no task-specific labels or hand-crafted grammars.

Abstract: The design of reliable, valid, and diverse molecules is fundamental to modern drug discovery, as improved molecular generation supports efficient exploration of the chemical space for potential drug candidates and reduces the cost of early design efforts. Despite these needs, current chemical language models that generate molecules as SMILES strings are vulnerable to compounding token errors: many samples are unparseable or chemically implausible, and hard constraints meant to prevent failure can restrict exploration. To address this gap, we introduce TSSR, a Two-Stage, Swap-Reward-driven reinforcement learning (RL) framework for character-level SMILES generation. Stage one rewards local token swaps that repair syntax, promoting transitions from invalid to parseable strings. Stage two provides chemistry-aware feedback from RDKit diagnostics, rewarding reductions in valence, aromaticity, and connectivity issues. The reward decomposes into interpretable terms (swap efficiency, error reduction, distance to validity), is model agnostic, and requires no task-specific labels or hand-crafted grammars. We evaluated TSSR on the MOSES benchmark using a GRU policy trained with PPO in both pure RL (P-RL) from random initialization and fine-tuning RL (F-RL) starting from a pretrained chemical language model, assessing 10,000 generated SMILES per run. In P-RL, TSSR significantly improves syntactic validity, chemical validity, and novelty. In F-RL, TSSR preserves drug-likeness and synthesizability while increasing validity and novelty. Token-level analysis shows that syntax edits and chemistry fixes act jointly to reduce RDKit detected errors. TSSR converts a sparse terminal objective into a denser and more interpretable reward, improving both syntactic and chemical quality without reducing diversity. TSSR is dataset-agnostic and can be adapted to various reinforcement learning approaches.

*Tianle Wang,Zhongyuan Wu,Shenghao Jin,Hao Xu,Wei Chen,Ning Miao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR training for LLMs follows a linear progression, enabling efficient prediction of future model states through weight or logits extrapolation, reducing computational costs while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR training for large language models requires thousands of training steps with substantial computational cost, largely due to prolonged exploration. The authors discovered that LLMs evolve linearly during RLVR, suggesting that most training time is spent amplifying early trends rather than discovering new behaviors.

Method: The authors propose two extrapolation methods: Weight Extrapolation and Logits Extrapolation. These leverage the linear evolution observed in LLMs during RLVR training to predict future model states from intermediate checkpoints, avoiding the need for continued expensive training.

Result: Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training with significantly less computation. Logits Extrapolation consistently outperforms continued RL training on all four benchmarks by extrapolating beyond the stable step range of RL training.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can be accelerated using linear extrapolation of model weights or logits, achieving comparable or better performance than standard RL training while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a central component of large language model (LLM) post-training. Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation. Moreover, Logits Extrapolation consistently outperforms continued RL training on all four benchmarks by extrapolating beyond the step range where RL training remains stable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes TAMP, a timeliness-aware scheduling algorithm for multi-region collaborative perception that balances perception accuracy and communication resources using Lyapunov optimization, achieving significant AP improvements in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative perception faces challenges in timeliness of transmitted information due to dynamic environments and constrained wireless bandwidth with limited computational power, requiring careful design of communication volume for effective feature representations.

Method: Proposes a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization, which decomposes long-term average objectives into per-slot prioritization problems using an empirical penalty function that maps Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance.

Result: Extensive simulations on real-world RCooper dataset show TAMP outperforms best-performing baselines, achieving up to 27% improvement in Average Precision across various configurations in intersection and corridor scenarios.

Conclusion: The TAMP scheduling algorithm effectively addresses the timeliness and resource constraints in collaborative perception by balancing perception accuracy and communication usage through dynamic prioritization of multi-region data transmission.

Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) is a critical technology in applications like autonomous driving and smart cities. It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TAMP outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an Average Precision (AP) improvement of up to 27% across various configurations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that GEnSHIN is an effective model for traffic flow prediction, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing models, especially during peak traffic hours, with each core module contributing significantly to the final results.

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, intelligent transportation systems have an increasing demand for accurate traffic flow prediction. This paper proposes a novel Graph Enhanced Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Inference Network (GEnSHIN) to handle the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic flow prediction. The model integrates three innovative designs: 1) An attention-enhanced Graph Convolutional Recurrent Unit (GCRU), which strengthens the modeling capability for long-term temporal dependencies by introducing Transformer modules; 2) An asymmetric dual-embedding graph generation mechanism, which leverages the real road network and data-driven latent asymmetric topology to generate graph structures that better fit the characteristics of actual traffic flow; 3) A dynamic memory bank module, which utilizes learnable traffic pattern prototypes to provide personalized traffic pattern representations for each sensor node, and introduces a lightweight graph updater during the decoding phase to adapt to dynamic changes in road network states. Extensive experiments on the public dataset METR-LA show that GEnSHIN achieves or surpasses the performance of comparative models across multiple metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Notably, the model demonstrates excellent prediction stability during peak morning and evening traffic hours. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each core module and its contribution to the final performance.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved classification accuracy and more stable learning performance under low-label conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves classification accuracy and achieves more stable learning performance under low-label conditions by enabling pseudo-label assignment to previously excluded samples and incorporating entropy-based confidence estimation.

Abstract: Conventional semi-supervised contrastive learning methods assign pseudo-labels only to samples whose highest predicted class probability exceeds a predefined threshold, and then perform supervised contrastive learning using those selected samples. In this study, we propose a novel loss function that estimates the confidence of each sample based on the entropy of its predicted probability distribution and applies confidence-based adaptive weighting. This approach enables pseudo-label assignment even to samples that were previously excluded from training and facilitates contrastive learning that accounts for the confidence of both anchor and positive samples in a more principled manner. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves classification accuracy and achieves more stable learning performance even under low-label conditions.

<details>

Conclusion: The paper concludes that pursuing multisensory AI has the potential to fundamentally change how humans and AI interact, enabling deeper connections through the synthesis of multiple sensory modalities.

Abstract: Our experience of the world is multisensory, spanning a synthesis of language, sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Yet, artificial intelligence has primarily advanced in digital modalities like text, vision, and audio. This paper outlines a research vision for multisensory artificial intelligence over the next decade. This new set of technologies can change how humans and AI experience and interact with one another, by connecting AI to the human senses and a rich spectrum of signals from physiological and tactile cues on the body, to physical and social signals in homes, cities, and the environment. We outline how this field must advance through three interrelated themes of sensing, science, and synergy. Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium. Secondly, developing a principled science for quantifying multimodal heterogeneity and interactions, developing unified modeling architectures and representations, and understanding cross-modal transfer. Finally, we present new technical challenges to learn synergy between modalities and between humans and AI, covering multisensory integration, alignment, reasoning, generation, generalization, and experience.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FENCE is a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method that adaptively controls guidance scales during imputation, improving accuracy for traffic data with high missing rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models use uniform guidance scales across spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates, leading to suboptimal imputation performance.

Method: FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on posterior likelihood approximations and computes guidance scales at the cluster level using attention scores.

Result: Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.

Conclusion: FENCE effectively improves imputation accuracy for traffic data by adaptively adjusting guidance scales based on posterior likelihood and spatial-temporal correlations, preventing both under-correction and overcorrection.

Abstract: Imputing missing values in spatial-temporal traffic data is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance.
  To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical RNNs impose an information bottleneck through deterministic hidden states, failing to capture the inherent ambiguity and multiple interpretations in music.

Method: Proposed Density Matrix RNN using quantum mechanics concepts - density matrix for mixed states, quantum channels (CPTP maps) for temporal dynamics, parameterization via Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, analytical framework with Von Neumann Entropy and Quantum Mutual Information.

Result: A novel theoretical architecture that maintains statistical ensembles of musical interpretations, captures classical probabilities and quantum coherences, and ensures physically valid learned dynamics by construction.

Conclusion: The DM-RNN offers a mathematically rigorous framework for modeling complex musical structures with inherent ambiguity, overcoming limitations of classical RNNs.

Abstract: Classical Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) summarize musical context into a deterministic hidden state vector, imposing an information bottleneck that fails to capture the inherent ambiguity in music. We propose the Density Matrix RNN (DM-RNN), a novel theoretical architecture utilizing the Density Matrix. This allows the model to maintain a statistical ensemble of musical interpretations (a mixed state), capturing both classical probabilities and quantum coherences. We rigorously define the temporal dynamics using Quantum Channels (CPTP maps). Crucially, we detail a parameterization strategy based on the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, ensuring the learned dynamics remain physically valid (CPTP) by construction. We introduce an analytical framework using Von Neumann Entropy to quantify musical uncertainty and Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) to measure entanglement between voices.

### [101] [DeepHalo: A Neural Choice Model with Controllable Context Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04616)
*Shuhan Zhang,Zhi Wang,Rui Gao,Shuang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepHalo is a neural framework that models context effects in human decision-making with explicit control over interaction order, achieving strong predictive performance while providing interpretability through systematic analysis of context interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human decision-making often shows context effects where preferences are influenced by the composition of the choice set. Existing models either focus on featureless settings or use restrictive interaction structures that limit interpretability, creating a need for more flexible and transparent approaches.

Method: We develop DeepHalo, a neural modeling framework that incorporates features and enables explicit control over interaction order through a principled architecture. The model systematically identifies interaction effects by order and serves as a universal approximator in featureless settings.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate strong predictive performance while providing greater transparency into the drivers of choice behavior through systematic identification of interaction effects by order.

Conclusion: DeepHalo provides a framework that successfully models context effects in human decision-making with neural networks while offering explicit control over interaction order and enhanced interpretability, demonstrating both strong predictive performance and transparency.

Abstract: Modeling human decision-making is central to applications such as recommendation, preference learning, and human-AI alignment. While many classic models assume context-independent choice behavior, a large body of behavioral research shows that preferences are often influenced by the composition of the choice set itself -- a phenomenon known as the context effect or Halo effect. These effects can manifest as pairwise (first-order) or even higher-order interactions among the available alternatives. Recent models that attempt to capture such effects either focus on the featureless setting or, in the feature-based setting, rely on restrictive interaction structures or entangle interactions across all orders, which limits interpretability. In this work, we propose DeepHalo, a neural modeling framework that incorporates features while enabling explicit control over interaction order and principled interpretation of context effects. Our model enables systematic identification of interaction effects by order and serves as a universal approximator of context-dependent choice functions when specialized to a featureless setting. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate strong predictive performance while providing greater transparency into the drivers of choice.

*Akiyoshi Tomihari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes RL post-training dynamics using neural tangent kernel theory, reveals that limited feature variability increases model confidence and reduces output diversity, and proposes classifier-first RL which accelerates optimization with distinct mechanisms from supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reduction in output diversity after RL post-training in language models, which remains poorly understood, and to gain a broader understanding of RL learning dynamics from a perspective studied in supervised learning but underexplored in RL.

Method: The paper adopts an empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework and decomposes the NTK into two components to characterize RL updates across training samples. It then proposes classifier-first reinforcement learning (CF-RL), a two-stage training strategy that prioritizes classifier updates before standard RL optimization.

Result: Experimental results show that limited variability in feature representations causes RL updates to systematically increase model confidence, explaining reduced output diversity. CF-RL demonstrates increased model confidence and accelerated optimization.

Conclusion: The study formalizes the learning dynamics of RL post-training and provides insights that motivate further analysis and improvement, demonstrating that classifier-first reinforcement learning (CF-RL) offers a distinct mechanism from linear-probing-then-fine-tuning in supervised learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a critical stage in modern language model development, playing a key role in improving alignment and reasoning ability. However, several phenomena remain poorly understood, including the reduction in output diversity. To gain a broader understanding of RL post-training, we analyze the learning dynamics of RL post-training from a perspective that has been studied in supervised learning but remains underexplored in RL. We adopt an empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework and decompose the NTK into two components to characterize how RL updates propagate across training samples. Our analysis reveals that limited variability in feature representations can cause RL updates to systematically increase model confidence, providing an explanation for the commonly observed reduction in output diversity after RL post-training. Furthermore, we show that effective learning in this regime depends on rapidly shaping the classifier, which directly affects the gradient component of the NTK. Motivated by these insights, we propose classifier-first reinforcement learning (CF-RL), a simple two-stage training strategy that prioritizes classifier updates before standard RL optimization. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis by demonstrating increased model confidence and accelerated optimization under CF-RL. Additional analysis shows that the mechanism underlying CF-RL differs from that of linear-probing-then-fine-tuning in supervised learning. Overall, our study formalizes the learning dynamics of RL post-training and motivates further analysis and improvement.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs) to address overparameterization in Gaussian Linear SCMs, presents an EM-based algorithm for estimating causal effects from finite observational data, and validates the approach theoretically and experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating causal effects from observational data is challenging, especially with latent confounders. While Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs) are widely used due to analytical tractability, parameter estimation is often infeasible with finite data due to overparameterization.

*Mir Rayat Imtiaz Hossain,Leo Feng,Leonid Sigal,Mohamed Osama Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple method that projects collaborative filtering embeddings into LLM token space, enabling better recommendations by combining structured interaction data with LLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based recommendation methods rely too much on text semantics or incorporate collaborative signals only through limited user/item embeddings, failing to handle multiple item embeddings and neglecting richer collaborative information.

Method: Project user and item embeddings from collaborative filtering into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projectors, then use finetuned LLMs to generate recommendations based on these projected embeddings and textual tokens.

Result: Preliminary results show the design effectively leverages user-item interaction data and improves recommendation performance over text-only LLM baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges collaborative filtering and LLMs by projecting embeddings into token space, offering a practical way to modernize recommendation systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising recommendation systems, offering novel ways to model user preferences through generative approaches. However, many existing methods often rely solely on text semantics or incorporate collaborative signals in a limited manner, typically using only user or item embeddings. These methods struggle to handle multiple item embeddings representing user history, reverting to textual semantics and neglecting richer collaborative information. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that projects user and item embeddings, learned from collaborative filtering, into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projector modules. A finetuned LLM then conditions on these projected embeddings alongside textual tokens to generate recommendations. Preliminary results show that this design effectively leverages structured user-item interaction data, improves recommendation performance over text-only LLM baselines, and offers a practical path for bridging traditional recommendation systems with modern LLMs.

### [106] [A zone-based training approach for last-mile routing using Graph Neural Networks and Pointer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04705)
*Àngel Ruiz-Fas,Carlos Granell,José Francisco Ramos,Joaquín Huerta,Sergio Trilles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning approach using zone-based training for last-mile delivery routing outperforms general training, especially for routes with more stops, by handling asymmetric travel times through Graph Neural Networks and Pointer Networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of classical heuristics in last-mile delivery routing when travel times are highly asymmetric, seeking to reduce delivery times through deep learning-based approaches that can better handle complex urban routing scenarios.

Method: The method involves an encoder-decoder architecture with a Graph Neural Network encoder and Pointer Network decoder. The approach divides geographical areas into zones using a Discrete Global Grid System and clusters, then trains separate model instances per zone using only stops within each zone.

Result: Evaluation using Los Angeles routes from the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Challenge shows that zone-based training reduces average predicted route length compared to general training, with performance improvements becoming more pronounced as the number of stops per route increases.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that using a zone-based training approach for last-mile routing with deep learning models leads to better performance, especially for routes with more stops, compared to general training across all geographical areas.

Abstract: Rapid e-commerce growth has pushed last-mile delivery networks to their limits, where small routing gains translate into lower costs, faster service, and fewer emissions. Classical heuristics struggle to adapt when travel times are highly asymmetric (e.g., one-way streets, congestion). A deep learning-based approach to the last-mile routing problem is presented to generate geographical zones composed of stop sequences to minimize last-mile delivery times.
  The presented approach is an encoder-decoder architecture. Each route is represented as a complete directed graph whose nodes are stops and whose edge weights are asymmetric travel times. A Graph Neural Network encoder produces node embeddings that captures the spatial relationships between stops. A Pointer Network decoder then takes the embeddings and the route's start node to sequentially select the next stops, assigning a probability to each unvisited node as the next destination.
  Cells of a Discrete Global Grid System which contain route stops in the training data are obtained and clustered to generate geographical zones of similar size in which the process of training and inference are divided. Subsequently, a different instance of the model is trained per zone only considering the stops of the training routes which are included in that zone.
  This approach is evaluated using the Los Angeles routes from the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Challenge. Results from general and zone-based training are compared, showing a reduction in the average predicted route length in the zone-based training compared to the general training. The performance improvement of the zone-based approach becomes more pronounced as the number of stops per route increases.

TL;DR: Proposes Excess Description Length (EDL) framework to quantify if fine-tuning elicits latent capabilities or teaches new skills, showing distinct scaling signatures between capability elicitation and teaching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether fine-tuning elicits latent capabilities or teaches new ones, a fundamental question for language model evaluation and safety.

Method: Developed a formal information-theoretic framework using Excess Description Length (EDL) based on prequential coding, comparing sequential encoding costs between online training and final model performance through toy models.

Result: EDL is non-negative in expectation, converges to surplus description length in infinite data, provides generalization bounds, and explains phenomena like minimal EDL from random labels, significant uncertainty reduction from single examples, and format learning transients distinct from capability acquisition.

Conclusion: The information-theoretic framework using Excess Description Length (EDL) provides rigorous foundations for distinguishing between capability elicitation and teaching, showing they have qualitatively distinct scaling signatures.

Abstract: Understanding whether fine-tuning elicits latent capabilities or teaches new ones is a fundamental question for language model evaluation and safety. We develop a formal information-theoretic framework for quantifying how much predictive structure fine-tuning extracts from the train dataset and writes into a model's parameters. Our central quantity, Excess Description Length (EDL), is defined via prequential coding and measures the gap between the bits required to encode training labels sequentially using an evolving model (trained online) and the residual encoding cost under the final trained model. We establish that EDL is non-negative in expectation, converges to surplus description length in the infinite-data limit, and provides bounds on expected generalization gain. Through a series of toy models, we clarify common confusions about information in learning: why random labels yield EDL near zero, how a single example can eliminate many bits of uncertainty about the underlying rule(s) that describe the data distribution, why structure learned on rare inputs contributes proportionally little to expected generalization, and how format learning creates early transients distinct from capability acquisition. This framework provides rigorous foundations for the empirical observation that capability elicitation and teaching exhibit qualitatively distinct scaling signatures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to continuously predict machine failures from real-time sensor data streams, accounting for the dynamic nature of real-world data where underlying patterns evolve over time.

Method: TimeCast is a dynamic prediction framework that identifies time-evolving patterns (stages) in multi-sensor data streams and learns individual models for each stage. It adapts to pattern shifts, captures time-varying interdependencies between sensors, and scales linearly with input size.

Result: Extensive experiments on real datasets show that TimeCast provides higher prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art methods while finding dynamic changes in data streams with a significant reduction in computational time.

Conclusion: TimeCast provides a scalable and practical solution for real-time machine failure prediction, offering higher accuracy than existing methods while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Given real-time sensor data streams obtained from machines, how can we continuously predict when a machine failure will occur? This work aims to continuously forecast the timing of future events by analyzing multi-sensor data streams. A key characteristic of real-world data streams is their dynamic nature, where the underlying patterns evolve over time. To address this, we present TimeCast, a dynamic prediction framework designed to adapt to these changes and provide accurate, real-time predictions of future event time. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Dynamic: it identifies the distinct time-evolving patterns (i.e., stages) and learns individual models for each, enabling us to make adaptive predictions based on pattern shifts. (b) Practical: it finds meaningful stages that capture time-varying interdependencies between multiple sensors and improve prediction performance; (c) Scalable: our algorithm scales linearly with the input size and enables online model updates on data streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that TimeCast provides higher prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art methods while finding dynamic changes in data streams with a great reduction in computational time.

TL;DR: Satellite-based PV forecasting models outperform traditional weather prediction systems for national-scale solar power nowcasting, achieving sub-10% error for most days and providing better uncertainty calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide the first comprehensive evaluation of spatiotemporal PV power forecasting at national scale and understand how mesoscale cloud systems shape national PV production on sub-hourly timescales.

Method: Developed a novel spatiotemporal PV power forecasting framework comparing seven intraday nowcasting models including satellite-based deep learning, optical-flow approaches, and physics-based NWP models, validated against satellite SSI data and converted to PV power using station-specific ML models across 6434 PV stations in Switzerland.

Result: Satellite-based approaches outperformed IFS-ENS, especially at short lead times. SolarSTEPS and SHADECast delivered most accurate SSI and PV power predictions, with SHADECast providing most reliable ensemble spread. IrradianceNet achieved lowest RMSE. National-scale forecasts showed relative errors below 10% for 82% of days in 2019-2020.

Conclusion: Satellite-based models, particularly SolarSTEPS and SHADECast, demonstrate superior performance for national-scale PV power forecasting compared to physics-based NWP models, with potential for operational use due to their accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for spatiotemporal photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting and use it to evaluate the reliability, sharpness, and overall performance of seven intraday PV power nowcasting models. The model suite includes satellite-based deep learning and optical-flow approaches and physics-based numerical weather prediction models, covering both deterministic and probabilistic formulations. Forecasts are first validated against satellite-derived surface solar irradiance (SSI). Irradiance fields are then converted into PV power using station-specific machine learning models, enabling comparison with production data from 6434 PV stations across Switzerland. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate spatiotemporal PV forecasting at a national scale. We additionally provide the first visualizations of how mesoscale cloud systems shape national PV production on hourly and sub-hourly timescales. Our results show that satellite-based approaches outperform the Integrated Forecast System (IFS-ENS), particularly at short lead times. Among them, SolarSTEPS and SHADECast deliver the most accurate SSI and PV power predictions, with SHADECast providing the most reliable ensemble spread. The deterministic model IrradianceNet achieves the lowest root mean square error, while probabilistic forecasts of SolarSTEPS and SHADECast provide better-calibrated uncertainty. Forecast skill generally decreases with elevation. At a national scale, satellite-based models forecast the daily total PV generation with relative errors below 10% for 82% of the days in 2019-2020, demonstrating robustness and their potential for operational use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual observation of cows in large-scale farming is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to reduced accuracy, leading to delays in disease detection and increased operational costs, necessitating an automated system.

Method: The study proposes an IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical System framework combined with a novel Machine Learning algorithm that analyzes physiological and behavioral data for disease detection.

Result: The proposed system is designed to monitor cow daily activities and health status, with the ML algorithm achieving high prediction accuracy for multiple common diseases using comprehensive physiological and behavioral features.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the proposed IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical System with the novel ML algorithm offers a viable solution for automated cow health monitoring, addressing the limitations of manual observation methods in large-scale farming.

Abstract: Manual observation and monitoring of individual cows for disease detection present significant challenges in large-scale farming operations, as the process is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to reduced accuracy. The reliance on human observation often leads to delays in identifying symptoms, as the sheer number of animals can hinder timely attention to each cow. Consequently, the accuracy and precision of disease detection are significantly compromised, potentially affecting animal health and overall farm productivity. Furthermore, organizing and managing human resources for the manual observation and monitoring of cow health is a complex and economically demanding task. It necessitates the involvement of skilled personnel, thereby contributing to elevated farm maintenance costs and operational inefficiencies. Therefore, the development of an automated, low-cost, and reliable smart system is essential to address these challenges effectively. Although several studies have been conducted in this domain, very few have simultaneously considered the detection of multiple common diseases with high prediction accuracy. However, advancements in Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Cyber-Physical Systems have enabled the automation of cow health monitoring with enhanced accuracy and reduced operational costs. This study proposes an IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical System framework designed to monitor the daily activities and health status of cow. A novel ML algorithm is proposed for the diagnosis of common cow diseases using collected physiological and behavioral data. The algorithm is designed to predict multiple diseases by analyzing a comprehensive set of recorded physiological and behavioral features, enabling accurate and efficient health assessment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AgentOCR uses visual token compression with segment caching and self-compression to maintain 95% performance while cutting token use by 50+% and achieving 20x faster rendering in RL agentic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the practical deployment bottleneck caused by rapidly growing textual histories in large language model-based agentic systems, which inflate token budgets and memory usage despite advances in reinforcement learning training.

Method: The method involves representing observation-action history as compact rendered images, employing segment optical caching with hashable segments to eliminate redundant re-rendering, and implementing agentic self-compression where agents emit compression rates and are trained with compression-aware rewards.

Result: Experimental results on ALFWorld and search-based QA benchmarks show AgentOCR preserves over 95% of text-based agent performance while reducing token consumption by more than 50%, with a 20x rendering speedup from segment optical caching and effective strategic balancing through self-compression.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that AgentOCR achieves a significant breakthrough in making RL-trained agentic systems practically deployable by balancing performance preservation with substantial efficiency gains in both token consumption and memory usage.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable agentic systems trained with reinforcement learning (RL) over multi-turn interaction trajectories, but practical deployment is bottlenecked by rapidly growing textual histories that inflate token budgets and memory usage. We introduce AgentOCR, a framework that exploits the superior information density of visual tokens by representing the accumulated observation-action history as a compact rendered image. To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining a visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks, ALFWorld and search-based QA. Remarkably, results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95\% of text-based agent performance while substantially reducing token consumption (>50\%), yielding consistent token and memory efficiency. Our further analysis validates a 20x rendering speedup from segment optical caching and the effective strategic balancing of self-compression.

Motivation: Existing Neural-Symbolic frameworks typically require either predefined symbolic policies or differentiable policies, limiting their application when domain expertise is unavailable or when policies are inherently non-differentiable.

Conclusion: The framework represents a significant step toward enabling Neural-Symbolic AI research in domains where acquiring symbolic knowledge from experts is challenging or infeasible, with approaches achieving median correct performance approaching 100%.

Abstract: Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a promising approach for combining the learning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretable reasoning of symbolic systems. However, existing NeSy frameworks typically require either predefined symbolic policies or policies that are differentiable, limiting their applicability when domain expertise is unavailable or when policies are inherently non-differentiable. We propose a framework that addresses this limitation by enabling the concurrent learning of both non-differentiable symbolic policies and neural network weights through an evolutionary process. Our approach casts NeSy systems as organisms in a population that evolve through mutations (both symbolic rule additions and neural weight changes), with fitness-based selection guiding convergence toward hidden target policies. The framework extends the NEUROLOG architecture to make symbolic policies trainable, adapts Valiant's Evolvability framework to the NeSy context, and employs Machine Coaching semantics for mutable symbolic representations. Neural networks are trained through abductive reasoning from the symbolic component, eliminating differentiability requirements. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that NeSy systems starting with empty policies and random neural weights can successfully approximate hidden non-differentiable target policies, achieving median correct performance approaching 100%. This work represents a step toward enabling NeSy research in domains where the acquisition of symbolic knowledge from experts is challenging or infeasible.

Result: Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial speedups while maintaining explanation correctness

Conclusion: The proposed graph partitioning approach with dropout-based reconstruction enables scalable and efficient node-level explainability for GNNs, addressing the memory-speed trade-off in large-scale applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, by exploiting the structural information in graph-structured data. However, in node classification, computing node-level explainability becomes extremely time-consuming as the size of the graph increases, while batching strategies often degrade explanation quality. This paper introduces a novel approach to parallelizing node-level explainability in GNNs through graph partitioning. By decomposing the graph into disjoint subgraphs, we enable parallel computation of explainability for node neighbors, significantly improving the scalability and efficiency without affecting the correctness of the results, provided sufficient memory is available. For scenarios where memory is limited, we further propose a dropout-based reconstruction mechanism that offers a controllable trade-off between memory usage and explanation fidelity. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial speedups, enabling scalable and transparent explainability for large-scale GNN models.

### [116] [AI Agents as Policymakers in Simulated Epidemics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04245)
*Goshi Aoki,Navid Ghaffarzadegan*

Main category: cs.MA

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore AI agents as computational models of decision-making, specifically for policy decisions during epidemics.

Method: They implement a generative AI agent in a simulated SEIR epidemic environment with dynamic memory, testing in single and ensemble settings with varying complexity.

Result: The AI agent exhibited human-like reactive behavior by adjusting restrictions based on case trends, and systems-level knowledge significantly improved decision quality and stability.

Conclusion: Yes, the agent develops memory by weighting past events by recency and adjusting policy decisions accordingly.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed as quasi-autonomous systems for specialized tasks, yet their potential as computational models of decision-making remains underexplored. We develop a generative AI agent to study repetitive policy decisions during an epidemic, embedding the agent, prompted to act as a city mayor, within a simulated SEIR environment. Each week, the agent receives updated epidemiological information, evaluates the evolving situation, and sets business restriction levels. The agent is equipped with a dynamic memory that weights past events by recency and is evaluated in both single- and ensemble-agent settings across environments of varying complexity. Across scenarios, the agent exhibits human-like reactive behavior, tightening restrictions in response to rising cases and relaxing them as risk declines. Crucially, providing the agent with brief systems-level knowledge of epidemic dynamics, highlighting feedbacks between disease spread and behavioral responses, substantially improves decision quality and stability. The results illustrate how theory-informed prompting can shape emergent policy behavior in AI agents. These findings demonstrate that generative AI agents, when situated in structured environments and guided by minimal domain theory, can serve as powerful computational models for studying decision-making and policy design in complex social systems.

### [117] [From Idea to Co-Creation: A Planner-Actor-Critic Framework for Agent Augmented 3D Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05016)
*Jin Gao,Saichandu Juluri*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Novel multi-agent self-reflection framework improves 3D modeling quality by combining Planner-Actor-Critic architecture with human supervision, outperforming single-prompt approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing approaches rely on single-prompt agents that directly execute modeling commands via tools like Blender MCP, which limits geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates

Method: Planner-Actor-Critic architecture with multi-agent self-reflection and human-in-the-loop supervision

Result: improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios; reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality of the result compared to direct single-prompt execution

Conclusion: structured agent self-reflection, when augmented by human oversight and advisory guidance, produces higher-quality 3D models while maintaining efficient workflow integration through real-time Blender synchronization

Abstract: We present a framework that extends the Actor-Critic architecture to creative 3D modeling through multi-agent self-reflection and human-in-the-loop supervision. While existing approaches rely on single-prompt agents that directly execute modeling commands via tools like Blender MCP, our approach introduces a Planner-Actor-Critic architecture. In this design, the Planner coordinates modeling steps, the Actor executes them, and the Critic provides iterative feedback, while human users act as supervisors and advisors throughout the process. Through systematic comparison between single-prompt modeling and our reflective multi-agent approach, we demonstrate improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that critic-guided reflection, combined with human supervisory input, reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality of the result compared to direct single-prompt execution. This work establishes that structured agent self-reflection, when augmented by human oversight and advisory guidance, produces higher-quality 3D models while maintaining efficient workflow integration through real-time Blender synchronization.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) Agents powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally shifted the paradigm for completing complex research tasks. Yet, a comprehensive and live evaluation of their forecasting performance on real-world, research-oriented tasks in high-stakes domains (e.g., finance) remains underexplored. We introduce FinDeepForecast, the first live, end-to-end multi-agent system for automatically evaluating DR agents by continuously generating research-oriented financial forecasting tasks. This system is equipped with a dual-track taxonomy, enabling the dynamic generation of recurrent and non-recurrent forecasting tasks at both corporate and macro levels. With this system, we generate FinDeepForecastBench, a weekly evaluation benchmark over a ten-week horizon, encompassing 8 global economies and 1,314 listed companies, and evaluate 13 representative methods. Extensive experiments show that, while DR agents consistently outperform strong baselines, their performance still falls short of genuine forward-looking financial reasoning. We expect the proposed FinDeepForecast system to consistently facilitate future advancements of DR agents in research-oriented financial forecasting tasks. The benchmark and leaderboard are publicly available on the OpenFinArena Platform.
