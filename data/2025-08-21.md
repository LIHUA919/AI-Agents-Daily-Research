### [1] [Large Language Models are Highly Aligned with Human Ratings of Emotional Stimuli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14214)
*Mattson Ogg,Chace Ashcraft,Ritwik Bose,Raphael Norman-Tenazas,Michael Wolmetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs like GPT-4o show strong alignment with human emotional ratings for words and images, particularly for happiness, but have lower alignment for arousal ratings and show more homogeneous responses than humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli and situations, which is crucial for determining their effectiveness in roles involving human interaction and emotional understanding.

Method: Elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images that were previously rated for emotional content by humans, comparing responses across different emotional frameworks.

Result: GPT-4o responded very similarly to human participants across modalities and most rating scales (r = 0.9+), with best alignment for happiness ratings and poorer alignment for arousal. LLMs aligned better with five-category emotion framework than two-dimensional organization, and showed more homogeneous ratings than humans.

Conclusion: LLMs interpret emotional stimuli with significant but imperfect alignment to human responses, highlighting both similarities and differences between biological and artificial intelligence in emotional evaluation domains.

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

*Maria Leonor Pacheco,Fabio Somenzi,Dananjay Srinivas,Ashutosh Trivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neurosymbolic approach combining SAT solvers and LLMs to explain Hitori puzzle solutions, using resolution proofs for local constraints and visual explanations for connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create effective explanations for complex decision sequences in puzzles like Hitori, which require both logical reasoning (local constraints) and visual understanding (connectivity constraints).

Method: Combines decision procedures (SAT solvers) for generating resolution proofs of local constraints with Large Language Models for visual explanations of connectivity constraints.

Result: Implemented a tool that assists humans in solving Hitori puzzles, with experimental evidence showing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Hitori serves as an excellent testing ground for neurosymbolic approaches, demonstrating successful integration of symbolic reasoning (SAT) and neural methods (LLMs) for comprehensive puzzle explanation.

Abstract: We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

### [3] [Automated Optimization Modeling through Expert-Guided Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14410)
*Beinuo Yang,Qishen Zhou,Junyi Li,Xingchen Su,Simon Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORThought framework uses chain-of-thought reasoning with expert optimization principles to automate optimization modeling, outperforming existing methods on complex problems with enhanced benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization modeling is time-consuming and error-prone, relying heavily on domain experts. Current LLM approaches have high error rates (up to 42%), narrow evaluation scope, and computational inefficiency.

Method: Enhanced datasets through systematic error correction and comprehensive annotation. Created LogiOR benchmark from logistics domain. Developed ORThought framework using chain-of-thought reasoning with expert optimization principles.

Result: ORThought outperforms existing approaches including multi-agent frameworks, with significant advantages on complex optimization problems.

Conclusion: The framework provides valuable insights for future LLM-based optimization modeling research, addressing critical limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic
analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes,
providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization
modeling.

### [4] [The Agent Behavior: Model, Governance and Challenges in the AI Digital Age](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14415)
*Qiang Zhang,Pei Yan,Yijia Xu,Chuanpo Fu,Yong Fang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Network Behavior Lifecycle model and A4A paradigm to analyze human-agent behavioral differences across 6 stages and 5 dimensions, addressing trust and security challenges in AI-human collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents increasingly mimic human behavior in networked environments, creating challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, and security due to difficulties in supervising agent behaviors and unclear accountability.

Method: Introduces Network Behavior Lifecycle model (6 stages), Agent for Agent (A4A) paradigm, and Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity (HABD) model analyzing 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency, intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.

Result: Model effectiveness verified through real-world cases including red team penetration and blue team defense scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure human-agent collaboration, with future research directions in dynamic cognitive governance, behavioral disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks.

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

### [5] [Who Sees What? Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14564)
*Luca Annese,Sabrina Patania,Silvia Serino,Tom Foulsham,Silvia Rossi,Azzurra Ruggeri,Dimitri Ognibene*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using structured examples from planner solution graphs to improve LLM-based agents' perspective-taking in ReAct framework, but results show limited success with persistent challenges in mentalizing about occluded spaces and epistemic actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent LLM advances offer potential for improving autonomous agents' perspective-taking capabilities, but current systems struggle with tasks involving active perception, collaborative reasoning, and understanding what other agents can see or know.

Method: Proposed structured solution-processing pipeline generating three example types from Fast Downward planner solution graphs: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths (E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences with alternative action contrasts (L-type), converted into "thought-action" examples via LLM prompting.

Result: L-type examples slightly reduced clarification requests and action steps but did not yield consistent improvements. Agents succeeded in basic attentional filtering but struggled with mentalizing about occluded spaces and weighing epistemic action costs.

Conclusion: Structured examples alone are insufficient for robust perspective-taking; explicit belief tracking, cost modeling, and richer environments are needed for socially grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

### [6] [LeanGeo: Formalizing Competitional Geometry problems in Lean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14644)
*Chendong Song,Zihan Wang,Frederick Pu,Haiming Wang,Xiaohan Lin,Junqi Liu,Jia Li,Zhengying Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanGeo is a unified formal system built on Lean 4 for solving competition-level geometry problems, featuring comprehensive theorem libraries and rigorous proof verification integrated with Mathlib.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing geometry solving systems that lack unified frameworks and struggle with verification due to reliance on intuitive diagrams, making integration with other mathematical fields difficult.

Method: Developed LeanGeo within Lean 4 theorem prover with comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems, created LeanGeo-Bench benchmark using IMO and advanced geometry problems, and evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs on this benchmark.

Result: The system enables rigorous proof verification and seamless integration with Mathlib, while evaluation reveals current limitations of LLMs in automated geometric reasoning.

Conclusion: LeanGeo provides a unified framework for formal geometry problem solving and verification, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated geometric reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified
framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields.
Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying
geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we
introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this
benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated
geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of
LeanGeo at https://github.com/project-numina/LeanGeo/tree/master.

### [7] [Entropy-Constrained Strategy Optimization in Urban Floods: A Multi-Agent Framework with LLM and Knowledge Graph Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14654)
*Peilin Ji,Xiao Xue,Simeng Wang,Wenhao Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: H-J is a hierarchical multi-agent framework that addresses urban flood emergency scheduling challenges by integrating knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven optimization, outperforming traditional methods in traffic management and system robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing extreme urban rainfall events cause severe flooding, traffic congestion, and service disruptions, but existing methods fail to handle dynamic trade-offs between competing goals, rapidly changing conditions, and LLM-generated strategy instability.

Method: H-J framework uses hierarchical multi-agent architecture with knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven optimization to create a closed-loop pipeline from multi-source perception to strategic execution and refinement.

Result: Evaluated on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under extreme, intermittent, and light rain conditions, H-J outperforms rule-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and system robustness.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the promise of uncertainty-aware, knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing urban flood response resilience through better coordination and dynamic optimization.

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

### [8] [MCP-Universe: Benchmarking Large Language Models with Real-World Model Context Protocol Servers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14704)
*Ziyang Luo,Zhiqi Shen,Wenzhuo Yang,Zirui Zhao,Prathyusha Jwalapuram,Amrita Saha,Doyen Sahoo,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Junnan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCP-Universe is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic tasks through MCP server interactions, covering 6 domains with 11 servers. It reveals significant performance limitations in top models and introduces long-context and unknown-tools challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are too simplistic and fail to capture real application challenges like long-horizon reasoning and large tool spaces in MCP environments.

Method: Created MCP-Universe benchmark with 6 core domains using 11 real-world MCP servers. Implemented execution-based evaluators including format, static, and dynamic evaluators for comprehensive assessment.

Result: Even SOTA models show poor performance (GPT-5: 43.72%, Grok-4: 33.33%, Claude-4.0-Sonnet: 29.44%). Enterprise agents like Cursor perform no better than standard ReAct frameworks. Benchmark reveals long-context and unknown-tools challenges.

Conclusion: MCP-Universe addresses critical gaps in LLM evaluation and provides an open-source extensible framework for researchers to integrate new agents and MCP servers, fostering innovation in the MCP ecosystem.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

### [9] [Data-Driven Probabilistic Evaluation of Logic Properties with PAC-Confidence on Mealy Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14710)
*Swantje Plambeck,Ali Salamati,Eyke Huellermeier,Goerschwin Fey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A data-driven PAC learning approach to determine safety probabilities for Cyber-Physical Systems with discrete Mealy machine abstractions, using active learning to guide sampling and validate with lane-keeping case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber-Physical Systems require powerful models for verification and diagnosis tasks, but suitable models are often unavailable and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches provide solutions using system-collected data.

Method: Proposes a data-driven approach based on Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning paradigm to determine safety probability over finite horizon. Uses active learning with guided sampling after initial data collection, connecting discrete logic with probabilistic reachability analysis.

Result: The approach provides additional confidence on determined safety probabilities through the PAC framework. Validated with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges discrete logic and probabilistic reachability analysis for CPS, offering a data-driven solution with confidence guarantees for safety probability determination in systems with discrete abstractions.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

### [10] [Privileged Self-Access Matters for Introspection in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14802)
*Siyuan Song,Harvey Lederman,Jennifer Hu,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for a thicker definition of AI introspection, proposing that true introspection requires processes more reliable than what external observers can achieve at equal or lower computational cost. Through experiments with LLMs reasoning about temperature parameters, the authors show models can appear to have lightweight introspection while failing meaningful introspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no consensus on defining introspection in AI models, and existing lightweight definitions may not capture meaningful introspection capabilities. The authors aim to establish a more robust definition that distinguishes true introspection from superficial capabilities.

Method: The authors conducted experiments where large language models (LLMs) were tasked with reasoning about their internal temperature parameters. They compared the models' performance against what third parties could achieve with similar computational resources.

Result: The experiments revealed that while LLMs can appear to demonstrate lightweight introspection (superficial self-awareness), they fail to achieve meaningful introspection according to the authors' proposed thicker definition, as their performance doesn't exceed what external observers can accomplish with comparable computational cost.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a thicker definition of introspection is necessary to properly evaluate AI capabilities, and that current LLMs demonstrate only superficial introspection rather than genuine introspective abilities that surpass external observation methods.

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

### [11] [Generative AI Against Poaching: Latent Composite Flow Matching for Wildlife Conservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14342)
*Lingkai Kong,Haichuan Wang,Charles A. Emogor,Vincent Börsch-Supan,Lily Xu,Milind Tambe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A flow matching approach for poaching prediction that addresses imperfect detection through occupancy modeling and data scarcity via composite flow initialization from linear models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poaching threatens wildlife and biodiversity, but existing prediction methods lack expressivity for complex spatiotemporal patterns. Current generative models face challenges with imperfect detection and limited data in real-world poaching scenarios.

Method: Integrates flow matching with occupancy-based detection model to infer underlying occupancy state in latent space. Uses composite flow initialized from linear-model predictions instead of random noise to inject prior knowledge and improve generalization.

Result: Evaluations on datasets from two Ugandan national parks show consistent gains in predictive accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses key challenges in poaching prediction by combining flow matching with occupancy modeling and prior knowledge injection, demonstrating improved performance in real-world conservation settings.

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable
step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform
patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching
prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the
expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent
advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more
flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data
faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited
data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an
occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the
underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite
flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which
is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving
generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show
consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

### [12] [Deep Learning for School Dropout Detection: A Comparison of Tabular and Graph-Based Models for Predicting At-Risk Students](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14057)
*Pablo G. Almeida,Guilherme A. L. Silva,Valéria Santos,Gladston Moreira,Pedro Silva,Eduardo Luz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNNs can outperform traditional ML for student dropout prediction when using optimal graph construction (PCA-KMeans clustering), with GraphSAGE achieving 7% F1-score and 2% accuracy improvement over XGBoost, but performance depends heavily on graph generation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Student dropout is a major educational challenge with significant social and economic costs. While traditional ML models work on tabular data, GNNs offer potential advantages by capturing complex relationships in student data when structured as graphs.

Method: Transformed tabular student data into graphs using clustering techniques (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP). Compared GNNs (custom GCN and GraphSAGE) against tabular models (Random Forest, XGBoost, TabNet) on real-world student dataset.

Result: GraphSAGE on PCA-KMeans derived graph achieved best performance: ~7 percentage point improvement in macro F1-score and ~2 percentage point improvement in accuracy over strongest tabular baseline (XGBoost). Other GNN configurations did not consistently outperform tabular models.

Conclusion: GNNs show potential for student dropout prediction but performance is highly dependent on graph generation strategy and architecture selection. Optimal transformation of tabular data to graphs remains challenging but promising when done correctly.

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide,
leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk
of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning
(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent
in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether
transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using
clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the
performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)
on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest
(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments
explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering
algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques
(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,
GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior
performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage
points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular
baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction
methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical
role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This
highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally
transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

### [13] [Load Forecasting on A Highly Sparse Electrical Load Dataset Using Gaussian Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14069)
*Chinmoy Biswas,Nafis Faisal,Vivek Chowdhury,Abrar Al-Shadid Abir,Sabir Mahmud,Mithon Rahman,Shaikh Anowarul Fattah,Hafiz Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gaussian interpolation effectively handles 62% sparse hourly power plant load data for forecasting, with LSTM models performing best among various ML approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparsity in real-world datasets poses challenges for forecasting, and traditional interpolation methods work best with Strict Sense Stationary data, but many real datasets are only Wide Sense Stationary.

Method: Statistical analysis of sparse power plant load data, application of Gaussian interpolation, and training/testing of multiple machine learning and deep learning models including LSTM networks.

Result: Gaussian interpolation proved suitable for handling sparse load forecasting data, and LSTM-based neural networks outperformed other classical and neural network models.

Conclusion: Gaussian interpolation is an effective method for dealing with sparse Wide Sense Stationary datasets in load forecasting, with LSTM models providing the best forecasting performance.

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

*Bachtiar Herdianto,Romain Billot,Flavien Lucas,Marc Sevaux,Daniele Vigo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid ML-metaheuristic approach for Vehicle Routing Problems using edge solution selector to classify prohibited moves during local search, improving performance across various problem sizes and variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance metaheuristic solutions for Vehicle Routing Problems by intelligently guiding local search through machine learning-based identification of prohibited moves, addressing scalability and generalization challenges.

Method: Develops edge solution selector using two approaches: 1) tabular binary classifier (Gradient Boosting Trees and Feedforward Neural Network) with threshold adjustment for class imbalance, and 2) Graph Neural Network to leverage graph structure for direct edge prediction. Both mechanisms are integrated into state-of-the-art metaheuristic baselines.

Result: The method demonstrates scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements across different metaheuristic baselines, various problem sizes (up to 30,000 customer nodes), and problem variants including CVRP and CVRPTW, with statistical verification of improvements.

Conclusion: The hybrid ML-metaheuristic approach successfully guides local search by identifying prohibited moves through edge classification, providing a scalable and generalizable solution that enhances performance across multiple VRP variants and problem scales.

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism
that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our
method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to
identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search
process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used
to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph
Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees
and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the
decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the
problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph
structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding
local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then
applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates
both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements

*Qian Zhanga,Ruilin Zhang,Jun Xiao,Yifan Liu,Zhe Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCLPD is a semi-supervised learning framework that combines multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight supervised fine-tuning to improve cross-dataset Parkinson's disease detection from EEG data, achieving high performance with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost of EEG data annotation leads to limited dataset sizes and discrepancies across datasets (different acquisition protocols, subject demographics), which hinders model robustness and generalizability in cross-dataset Parkinson's disease detection scenarios.

Method: Proposes MCLPD framework with: 1) Self-supervised pre-training on unlabeled UNM dataset using dual augmentations in time and frequency domains to create contrastive pairs and fuse time-frequency information, 2) Lightweight supervised fine-tuning using only 1-5% labeled data from UI and UC datasets.

Result: Achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on UI and 0.81 on UC with 1% labeled data, improving to 0.97 and 0.87 respectively with 5% labeled data. Substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while reducing dependency on labeled data compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MCLPD demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing cross-dataset PD detection performance through semi-supervised learning, successfully addressing challenges of limited labeled data and dataset discrepancies in EEG-based Parkinson's disease detection.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been validated as an effective technique for
detecting Parkinson's disease,particularly in its early stages.However,the high
cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and
considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition
protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and
generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such
challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named
MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight
supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During
pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM
dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time
and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency
information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data
from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised
optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on
UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97
and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing
methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while
reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Motivation: Address challenges in Parkinson's disease detection from EEG data due to dataset variability and small sample sizes across different EEG datasets, which hinder training generalizable models for cross-dataset scenarios.

Method: Uses a GAN-based approach with: 1) Generative network creating fusion EEG data by controlling distribution similarity between generated and real data, 2) EEG signal quality assessment model to ensure generated data quality, 3) Classification network combining multiple CNNs to capture time-frequency characteristics while maintaining generalizable structure.

Result: Achieves 84.3% accuracy and 84.0% F1-score in cross-dataset settings, performing comparably to state-of-the-art models and demonstrating strong generalizability.

Conclusion: The GEPD model successfully addresses cross-dataset generalization challenges in EEG-based Parkinson's detection, showing potential for facilitating neurological disease diagnosis and monitoring through intelligent methods.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been established as an effective method for
detecting Parkinson's disease, typically diagnosed early.Current Parkinson's
disease detection methods have shown significant success within individual
datasets, however, the variability in detection methods across different EEG
datasets and the small size of each dataset pose challenges for training a
generalizable model for cross-dataset scenarios. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, named GEPD, specifically for
EEG-based cross-dataset classification of Parkinson's disease.First, we design
a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the
distribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an
EEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of
generated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a
combination of multiple convolutional neural networks to effectively capture
the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a
generalizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to
utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to
facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation
results demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art
models in cross-dataset settings, achieving an accuracy of 84.3% and an
F1-score of 84.0%, showcasing the generalizability of the proposed model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PersRM-R1 is a reasoning-based reward modeling framework that uses synthetic data generation and two-stage training to capture personal preferences from limited exemplars, outperforming similar-sized models and matching larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific preferences with limited data across diverse domains, creating a need for better personalized alignment.

Method: Combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to identify personal factors from few exemplars.

Result: Outperforms existing models of similar size and matches performance of much larger models in both accuracy and generalizability.

Conclusion: Paves the way for more effective personalized LLMs by enabling better capture of user-specific preferences with limited data.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim
to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during
fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific
preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we
introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework
specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one
or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data
availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach
combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline
consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of
similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy
and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

TL;DR: Label smoothing is shown to be equivalent to information bottleneck optimization, providing theoretical and experimental evidence that it helps models focus on relevant information while ignoring irrelevant factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reinterpret label smoothing through the lens of information bottleneck theory and demonstrate its practical implementation advantages over traditional information bottleneck methods.

Method: Theoretical analysis under assumptions of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels, combined with experimental validation showing label smoothing's information bottleneck properties.

Result: Label smoothing achieves optimal information bottleneck solutions, exhibits insensitivity to irrelevant factors, and provides a simpler implementation compared to standard information bottleneck approaches.

Conclusion: Label smoothing serves as an effective and practical information bottleneck method that helps models focus on task-relevant information while filtering out noise and irrelevant factors.

Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck.
Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels
for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the
model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of
the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted
as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple
implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show
that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors
that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no
additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

*Mohamed Hassan Abdalla Idris,Jakub Marek Cebula,Jebraeel Gholinezhad,Shamsul Masum,Hongjie Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: New ML framework combining reservoir engineering knowledge (PI-based feature selection) with Inductive Conformal Prediction for robust oil production forecasting with guaranteed uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting by addressing multivariate time series analysis challenges and providing rigorous uncertainty quantification for complex, non-normal data.

Method: Integrates Productivity Index-driven feature selection with Inductive Conformal Prediction. Tests LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and XGBoost algorithms on Volve and Norne oil field data. Uses MAE, Forecast Bias, and Prediction Direction Accuracy for evaluation.

Result: LSTM achieved best performance with lowest MAE (19.468 test, 29.638 out-of-sample for well PF14). PI-based feature selection reduced input dimensionality. ICP provided valid 95% prediction intervals without distributional assumptions.

Conclusion: Combining domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques significantly improves reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts, with LSTM showing superior performance and ICP offering robust uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the
robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically
addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology
integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived
from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve
(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the
efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).
All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming
future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using
traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and
Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing
capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input
dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The
uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a
distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,
95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a
distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for
complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the
LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample
forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well
E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining
domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the
reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comprehensive empirical study on robust fine-tuning shows that supervised CNNs pretrained on large datasets often outperform attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations for adversarial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are vulnerable to input perturbations, and while robust fine-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative to training from scratch, the impact of various design choices (architecture, pretraining, optimization strategies) on robust generalization remains poorly understood.

Method: Conducted large-scale empirical study spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3 adaptation protocols, resulting in 1,440 training configurations and 7,200 robustness measurements across five perturbation types.

Result: Found that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pretrained in a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best, challenging the assumption that attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are superior.

Conclusion: The study provides both confirmation and challenges to prior design assumptions, offers practical guidance for robust fine-tuning, and highlights promising research directions in adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small
input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by
training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using
specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more
efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are
adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust
fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the
model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss
objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,
and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust
generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when
exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these
design choices influence generalization remains an open question with
significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study
spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3
adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200
robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this
is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.
While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are
increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in
a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both
confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising
research directions and offering practical guidance.

*Guanghao Jin,Jingpei Wu,Tianpei Guo,Yiyi Niu,Weidong Zhou,Guoyang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new benchmark called KnowDR-REC is proposed for evaluating knowledge-driven referring expression comprehension, featuring real-world knowledge requirements, negative samples via expression editing, and novel evaluation metrics to assess multimodal reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional REC benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as they rely on intra-image cues or lack fine-grained annotations, failing to assess true reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors create KnowDR-REC benchmark with three key features: 1) real-world knowledge base requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning, 2) negative samples constructed through fine-grained expression editing to test robustness, and 3) three novel evaluation metrics to explore model reasoning processes.

Result: Evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art multimodal models shows they struggle with knowledge-driven visual grounding tasks. A decoupling between textual understanding and visual grounding is observed, with models influenced by memorized shortcut correlations that hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: The benchmark aims to inspire development of more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding frameworks for reliable multimodal systems in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that
aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given
textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models,
traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack
sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,
characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world
knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.
Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via
fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and
anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics
to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate
16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results
showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual
grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual
understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are
significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely
affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.
We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards
developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding
frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal
systems for complex real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm helps EP-trained RNNs overcome catastrophic forgetting in continuous learning, matching or surpassing BPTT-trained models on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in EP-trained RNNs by mimicking human brain's memory consolidation during sleep through replay mechanisms.

Method: Proposed sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for Equilibrium Propagation-trained recurrent neural networks, combined with rehearsal techniques.

Result: SRC significantly improved resilience to catastrophic forgetting. MRNN-EP with SRC performed on par with BPTT models on MNIST and surpassed them on Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet. Combination with rehearsal further boosted long-term knowledge retention.

Conclusion: Sleep-like replay techniques are applicable to RNNs and enable integration of human-like learning behaviors into artificial neural networks, providing effective solution for continuous learning challenges.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP),
a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong
performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement
learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous
learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is
overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the
human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided
by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of
learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a
sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found
that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in
continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC
implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model
(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks
incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP
performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models
on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.
Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the
network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new
tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to
RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors
into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

*Ye Su,Hezhe Qiao,Wei Huang,Lin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRILL is a novel semi-supervised regression framework that transforms regression into discrete distribution estimation to improve label distribution learning and prevent overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised regression methods rely heavily on pseudo-label quality and direct regression fails to learn label distribution properly, leading to overfitting.

Method: Transforms regression into Discrete Distribution Estimation over multiple buckets, uses Decoupled Distribution Alignment to align target and non-target bucket distributions between teacher and student models.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse domains show DRILL outperforms competing methods and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: DRILL effectively addresses semi-supervised regression challenges by capturing underlying label distributions and preventing overfitting through discrete distribution estimation and distribution alignment.

Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of
samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently
received considerable attention across various applications, including computer
vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing
semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the
general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods
heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to
learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address
these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation
distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the
semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task
into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to
better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of
overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled
Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket
between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the
student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.
Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate
that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing
methods.

TL;DR: A contrastive self-learning framework for inferring accurate crowd flow at POIs from low-quality data using spatial graphs and contrastive learning


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate crowd flow monitoring at POIs is crucial for traffic management and urban planning, but current sensing techniques produce inadequate data quality, making inference challenging due to scarce labeled data, complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and correlations between precise flow and GPS reports.

Method: Recast crowd flow inference as self-supervised attributed graph representation learning. Construct spatial adjacency graph based on POIs and distances, use contrastive learning with swapped prediction to exploit unlabeled spatio-temporal data, then fine-tune with accurate crowd flow data.

Result: Experiments on two real-world datasets show the proposed framework consistently outperforms models trained from scratch when pre-trained on extensive noisy data.

Conclusion: The contrastive self-learning framework effectively addresses the challenges of crowd flow inference by leveraging unlabeled data through graph representation learning and contrastive techniques, demonstrating superior performance over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

TL;DR: A scalable sparse regression framework for discovering interpretable PDEs and subgrid-scale closures from multi-parameter data, with innovations in parameterization, dimensional consistency, memory efficiency, and robust model identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing SINDy methods and enable discovery of physical models from multi-parameter simulation data, particularly for subgrid-scale closures in turbulence modeling without prior theoretical assumptions.

Method: Four key innovations: symbolic parameterization for varying physical parameters, Dimensional Similarity Filter for unit consistency, memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation for batch processing, and ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis.

Result: Successfully recovered governing equations across parameter ranges and discovered Smagorinsky-type closure structure (τ_SGS = 0.1603·Δ²(∂ū/∂x)²) with Smagorinsky constant ~0.4004. Achieved R² = 0.886 across filter scales with improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures.

Conclusion: The framework provides a complementary data-driven approach to turbulence modeling, capable of autonomously discovering physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrating coefficients from data without theoretical priors.

Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for
discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale
closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations
through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical
parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter
enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries;
memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and
ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model
identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable
recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered
Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} =
0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$,
corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This
represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data
without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and
demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The
framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate
coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling
methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.

TL;DR: EEGDM: A lightweight generative diffusion model framework for EEG representation learning that outperforms state-of-the-art EEG foundation models while being 19x more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG foundation models are computationally expensive with marginal performance gains as model size increases, creating a need for more efficient yet effective representation learning methods for EEG signals.

Method: Proposed EEGDM framework using structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to capture EEG temporal dynamics, trained with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, and latent fusion transformer (LFT) for downstream classification tasks.

Result: Outperformed existing state-of-the-art EEG foundation models on Temple University EEG Event Corpus while being approximately 19x more lightweight.

Conclusion: EEGDM provides a promising lightweight alternative to current EEG foundation models, offering better performance with significantly reduced computational costs.

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the
brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning
meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to
limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation
models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer
architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language
models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG
data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large
models often incurred high computational costs during both training and
inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.
In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon
Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured
state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the
temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were
then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion
transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple
University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art
approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method
outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.
These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current
FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scientific foundation model for particle physics that scales to 188M parameters, outperforms baselines across diverse tasks using self-supervised learning on detector data, and shows robust data-efficient adaptation with task-agnostic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To apply the foundation model paradigm to experimental particle physics despite the challenges posed by sparse, spatially distributed detector data that differs dramatically from natural language.

Method: Proposed a novel self-supervised training method for detector data, created a dataset with 11M+ particle collision events, used frozen weights with task-specific adapters, and scaled models up to 188M parameters.

Result: The foundation model consistently outperformed baseline models across all downstream tasks, exhibited robust data-efficient adaptation, and produced task-agnostic representations that could be specialized via simple linear mapping.

Conclusion: A foundation model for particle physics can successfully scale and generalize across diverse tasks, demonstrating the viability of self-supervised learning approaches for complex scientific detector data.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling
large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has
inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,
applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to
the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs
dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle
physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new
dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of
downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel
self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural
scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen
weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline
models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust
data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations
extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single
linear mapping for different downstream tasks.

### [30] [CoBAD: Modeling Collective Behaviors for Human Mobility Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14088)
*Haomin Wen,Shurui Cao,Leman Akoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoBAD is a novel model for detecting collective anomalies in human mobility by modeling spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals using a two-stage attention mechanism and pre-training on large-scale collective behavior data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collective anomaly detection in human mobility remains underexplored compared to individual anomaly detection, requiring modeling of complex spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, which traditional methods cannot handle effectively.

Method: Proposes CoBAD model that formulates the problem using Collective Event Sequences with co-occurrence event graphs, employs two-stage attention mechanism to model individual patterns and interactions, and uses pre-training with masked event and link reconstruction tasks.

Result: CoBAD significantly outperforms existing baselines with 13%-18% improvement in AUCROC and 19%-70% improvement in AUCPR on large-scale mobility datasets, effectively detecting both co-occurrence and absence anomalies.

Conclusion: CoBAD successfully addresses the challenge of collective anomaly detection in human mobility by capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and opening new directions for this underexplored area.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as
public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods
primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at
home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in
collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home
alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.
Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling
spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional
complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to
capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first
formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences
(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event
sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention
mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions
across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior
data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to
detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies
and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior
work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that
CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving
an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR. All source code is

*Matthew Morris,David J. Tena Cucala,Bernardo Cuenca Grau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses explainability in GNNs for link prediction by extracting Datalog rules from monotonic GNNs with scoring functions, providing sound explanations while maintaining good performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve explainability of GNNs in knowledge graph link prediction by moving beyond restricted low-expressivity methods and addressing the more general approach using scoring functions.

Method: Adapt GNNs and scoring functions to be monotonic, then extract sound Datalog rules from these monotonic models to explain predictions while leveraging existing results about rule capture capabilities.

Result: Experiments show that monotonic GNNs with scoring functions perform well on link prediction benchmarks and yield many sound rules for explanation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully combines the predictive power of GNNs with scoring functions while providing explainable Datalog rule extraction, bridging performance and interpretability in knowledge graph link prediction.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction:
predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack
of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs
with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to
explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the
expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a
form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph
encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular
approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN
output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be
adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for
explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules
that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining
equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring
functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic
GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

*Benjamin Pikus,Pratyush Ranjan Tiwari,Burton Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prioritizing hard examples for language model fine-tuning yields up to 47% performance gains compared to easy examples when using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under fixed budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting high-quality training data for language model fine-tuning is expensive, and practitioners need guidance on how to best allocate limited budgets by selecting examples of optimal difficulty levels.

Method: Study Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes and families, comparing four subset selection policies (easy, medium, hard, random difficulty) chosen from the same unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates via multi-sample evaluation.

Result: Training on the hardest examples yields the largest performance gains (up to 47%), while training on easy examples yields the smallest gains. Harder examples provide more learnable opportunities during GRPO training.

Conclusion: For budget-constrained post-training, prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning tasks when using GRPO.

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is
expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be
procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained
alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize
examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes
and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same
unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample
evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields
the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield
the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder
examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These
findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training:
prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning
tasks when using GRPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-informed reward machines (pRMs) enhance reinforcement learning by incorporating symbolic knowledge about physical environments, enabling more expressive reward specification and significantly improving learning efficiency through counterfactual experiences and reward shaping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of standard reward machines by incorporating physical knowledge, thereby improving expressiveness, programmability, and learning efficiency in reinforcement learning tasks involving physical environments.

Method: Developed physics-informed reward machines (pRMs) that combine symbolic representation with physical knowledge, and created RL algorithms that exploit pRMs through counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping techniques.

Result: Experimental results show accelerated reward acquisition during training phases, with significant improvements in learning efficiency across both finite and continuous physical environments and various control tasks.

Conclusion: pRMs provide a powerful framework for specifying complex learning objectives in RL, enabling more efficient learning by leveraging physical knowledge and structured reward mechanisms, with demonstrated effectiveness in diverse physical control environments.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian
rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness
and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the
environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and
must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such
as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample
complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines
(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and
reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,
expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of
exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our
experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition
during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and
effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous
physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly
improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

### [34] [Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14101)
*Akash Choudhuri,Yongjian Zhong,Bijaya Adhikari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IHNN is a novel hypergraph neural network that uses implicit differentiation to capture long-range dependencies while maintaining performance, outperforming existing methods in node classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hypergraph neural networks fail to capture long-range high-order dependencies effectively - increasing message-passing rounds degrades performance, while too few rounds only capture local information.

Method: Proposes Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN) that jointly learns fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges using implicit differentiation and a tractable projected gradient descent approach.

Result: Extensive experiments show IHNN outperforms prior works in most settings for node classification on real-world hypergraphs, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: IHNN successfully addresses the long-range dependency problem in hypergraph learning through implicit differentiation, providing an effective end-to-end framework that maintains performance while capturing complex high-order relationships.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order
relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains,
including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural
networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn
latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive
tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small
number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then
utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a
cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego
long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly
increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also
degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture
long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.
Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency
issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing
hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more
information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit
Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns
fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end
manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we
introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node
classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in
most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

*Madyan Bagosher,Tala Mustafa,Mohammad Alsmirat,Amal Al-Ali,Isam Mashhour Al Jawarneh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Smart parking framework using multiple data sources and machine learning models to predict parking availability on university campuses without physical sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban growth and limited parking spaces on university campuses create challenges for students finding parking during class times, requiring efficient allocation systems.

Method: Integrated street maps, mobility, and meteorological data through spatial join operations. Evaluated Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest, and LSTM models with hyperparameter tuning using grid search.

Result: Random Forest Regression performed best with RMSE of 0.142 and R2 of 0.582, though LSTM may outperform with more data and longer timesteps due to time-series nature.

Conclusion: The proposed sensor-free framework effectively predicts parking availability using available data sources, with Random Forest showing best performance among tested models.

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in
managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly
pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking
spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability
of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing
efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a
smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,
mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture
parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive
days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require
any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to
provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location
services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to
specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear
Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was
employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142
and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an
LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis of trust region methods (TRPO/PPO) under varying action space dimensionality in morphological generalization tasks, with empirical validation using Gymnasium Swimmer environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for morphological generalization in reinforcement learning requires understanding how trust region methods behave with varying action space dimensionality in graph-based policy architectures.

Method: Conducted theoretical analysis of TRPO and PPO optimization landscapes under KL-divergence and policy clipping constraints with varying action dimensions, complemented by empirical evaluation using Gymnasium Swimmer environment with controlled kinematic variations.

Result: Analysis reveals how action space dimensionality influences trust region optimization behavior under different constraint mechanisms, providing insights for morphological generalization.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical foundations and empirical evidence for trust region methods' performance in morphological generalization tasks, addressing a critical gap in understanding variable action space optimization.

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

### [37] [ERIS: An Energy-Guided Feature Disentanglement Framework for Out-of-Distribution Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14134)
*Xin Wu,Fei Teng,Ji Zhang,Xingwang Li,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ERIS framework enables guided feature disentanglement for time series classification by combining energy-guided calibration, weight-level orthogonality, and adversarial training to achieve better OOD performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series classification methods suffer from spurious correlations as they entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, lacking semantic guidance for effective feature disentanglement needed for reliable out-of-distribution performance.

Method: Proposed ERIS framework with three key mechanisms: 1) energy-guided calibration for semantic guidance, 2) weight-level orthogonality strategy for structural independence between features, and 3) auxiliary adversarial training with structured perturbations for robustness.

Result: ERIS improves state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: The ERIS framework successfully addresses the feature entanglement problem in time series classification by providing semantic guidance for disentanglement, resulting in significantly improved out-of-distribution performance.

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant
representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models
inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in
spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,
current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required
to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework
to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that
effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also
semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key
mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an
energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance
for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a
weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between
domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their
interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances
robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that
ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy
across four benchmarks.

TL;DR: STAS framework reduces SNN latency and energy consumption by 30-46% while improving accuracy through spatio-temporal adaptive computation and unified input representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to multi-timestep operations. Existing dynamic computation methods are fragmented and incompatible with SNN-based vision Transformers.

Method: Proposes STAS framework with integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module for temporal stability and adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module for 2D token pruning across spatial and temporal axes.

Result: Reduces energy consumption by 45.9% on CIFAR-10, 43.8% on CIFAR-100, and 30.1% on ImageNet while improving accuracy over state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: STAS successfully addresses temporal dissimilarity and architectural limitations in SNN-based vision Transformers, achieving significant energy savings and accuracy improvements through co-designed static architecture and dynamic computation policy.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage biological neural circuit principles (modular, hierarchical, sparse connectivity) from mouse visual cortex to design more efficient artificial neural networks that balance wiring cost, functional specialization, and robustness.

Method: Introduced G2GNet with sparse modular connectivity across feedforward layers based on biological functional connectivity patterns. Added dynamic sparse training with pruning/regrowing edges and Hebbian-inspired rewiring based on activation correlations.

Result: Achieved up to 75% sparsity while improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 benchmarks, outperforming dense baselines with significantly fewer computations and parameters.

Conclusion: Biologically-inspired sparse connectivity patterns can significantly improve ANN efficiency and performance, demonstrating the value of neuroscience principles in artificial network design.

Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and
sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost,
functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable
insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks
grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for
reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.
Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of
functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,
ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,
a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across
feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully
connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision
benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate
biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in
ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST)
mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a
Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on
principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while
improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer
computations.

TL;DR: Machine learning models combined with optimization algorithms to design cost-effective shape memory alloys with target martensitic start temperature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing affordable and sustainable shape memory alloys that meet performance targets is challenging, requiring optimization of compositions to achieve desired properties while minimizing cost.

Method: Used tree-based ensemble and neural network ML models trained on experimental SMA data with physics-informed features. Paired tree model with COBYLA (derivative-free optimizer) and neural network with TRUST-CONSTR (gradient-based optimizer) to search for optimal alloy compositions.

Result: Both models predicted Ms with similar accuracy, but neural network with gradient-based optimizer found better solutions more consistently. TRUST-CONSTR showed stable behavior and better met both objectives, while COBYLA often converged to suboptimal results.

Conclusion: Combining physics-informed data, machine learning, and optimization provides practical approach for SMA design. Neural network with gradient-based optimization outperforms tree model with derivative-free methods. Approach can be extended to other materials with limited data.

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while
remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we
focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start
temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning
models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to
search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine
learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of
experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The
tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the
neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a
gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both
models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural
network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to
suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target.
The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching
alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a
practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining
physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms.
Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the
use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The
approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be
made with limited data.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets in both accuracy and expected calibration error, scales to large models like Llama3-8B.

Conclusion: ABMLL provides computationally efficient generalization improvement with better uncertainty quantification for LoRA fine-tuning of large language models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a
cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,
it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well
it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve
generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning
to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and
computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of
parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these
challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This
method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting
this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We
reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a
set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity
of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective
generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a
result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty
quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that
it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy
and expected calibration error.

TL;DR: GLASS introduces training-free dynamic pruning for LLMs using rank-aggregation of local and global neuron statistics, outperforming prior methods in long-form generation without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge deployment of LLMs requires aggressive pruning to reduce computation while maintaining quality. Existing methods either use fixed sparsity patterns, add runtime overhead, or fail on short prompts/long generations.

Method: A/I-GLASS uses activation- and impact-based global-local neural importance aggregation to dynamically select FFN units through rank-aggregation of prompt local statistics and model-intrinsic global statistics.

Result: Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks show GLASS significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, especially in challenging long-form generation scenarios.

Conclusion: GLASS provides effective training-free dynamic pruning without auxiliary predictors or inference overhead, making it suitable for edge deployment of large language models.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive,
prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality.
Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or
incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on
statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation
scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local
neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two
training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a
rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics.
Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS
significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in
challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary
predictors or adding any inference overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agent-based framework for adaptive sensor placement in modal testing using reinforcement learning to optimize sensor locations across changing test environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional modal test design approaches are static and rigid, compromising accuracy and adaptability by not accounting for evolving test parameters and their impact on sensor configurations.

Method: An agent-based decision support framework using underspecified partially observable Markov decision process, trained with dual-curriculum reinforcement learning for adaptive sensor placement.

Result: Case study on steel cantilever structure demonstrates efficacy in optimizing sensor locations across frequency segments, showing robustness and real-world applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of traditional static approaches by providing adaptive sensor placement that improves test accuracy and adaptability in dynamic modal testing environments.

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing
essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering
industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves
complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions
that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to
test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without
accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes
on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have
been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies
often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations,
this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive
sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The
framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable
Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement
learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case
study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its
robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing recognition that multiple fairness measures (both group and individual notions) need to be considered simultaneously, but their relative weights are unknown, time-varying, and must be learned adaptively

Method: Proposes an approach for learning time-varying convex combinations of multiple fairness measures using limited graph-structured feedback

Result: The paper presents a method for adaptively learning the appropriate weights for combining different fairness regularizers in real-time

Conclusion: This work addresses the practical challenge of dynamically balancing multiple fairness constraints when their relative importance may change over time, using efficient feedback mechanisms

Abstract: There is an increasing appreciation that one may need to consider multiple
measures of fairness, e.g., considering multiple group and individual fairness
notions. The relative weights of the fairness regularisers are a priori
unknown, may be time varying, and need to be learned on the fly. We consider
the learning of time-varying convexifications of multiple fairness measures
with limited graph-structured feedback.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIRL-S unifies RL and search-based test-time scaling by using the RL-learned reward function as an ideal process reward model (PRM) for search, eliminating need for labeled intermediate data and improving performance by 9% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods have limitations: RL methods suffer from instability and low efficiency, while search-based methods require expensive labeled data and degrade under distribution shifts. A unified approach is needed.

Method: Uses adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces without labeled intermediate data.

Result: Improves performance by 9% on average across 8 benchmarks (mathematics, scientific reasoning, code generation), matching GPT-4o. Outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data when integrated into search algorithms.

Conclusion: The RL-learned reward function serves as the best PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution for complex reasoning tasks in LLMs without requiring labeled process data.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen
into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods
that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low
sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently
trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or
LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this
paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and
search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function
learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding
downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to
learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely
eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the
resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a
heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning
chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task
generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including
mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our
unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,
matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,
our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.
These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best
PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex
reasoning tasks in LLMs.

*Amalie Roark,Serio Agriesti,Francisco Camara Pereira,Guido Cantelmo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-learning framework improves MFD estimation with limited loop detectors by leveraging multi-city data and physics-informed neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams requires many loop detectors that are often unavailable, creating data scarcity challenges for traffic analysis.

Method: Proposes meta-learning framework with Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network that trains on multiple cities' data to estimate MFD for cities with limited detectors.

Result: Achieves average MSE improvement in flow prediction between ~17,500-36,000, successfully generalizing across diverse urban settings with limited data.

Conclusion: Meta-learning effectively addresses data scarcity in MFD estimation, outperforming traditional transfer learning and proving transferable across different urban networks.

Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe
traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic
control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network
requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in
practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a
subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to
new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed
model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and
exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of
detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is
applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically
designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow
prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop
detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes
across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited
data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number
of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against
traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a
non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

TL;DR: Teacher-guided reinforcement learning techniques significantly improve training efficiency and early performance in autonomous cyber operations compared to learning from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous cyber operations require agents to learn from scratch, resulting in slow convergence and poor early-stage performance, while teacher-guided techniques have shown promise in other domains but haven't been applied to cybersecurity.

Method: Implemented four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the simulated CybORG environment and conducted comparative evaluation.

Result: Teacher integration significantly improves training efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed.

Conclusion: Teacher-guided techniques show strong potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity operations by enhancing training efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However,
existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow
convergence and poor early-stage performance. While teacher-guided techniques
have demonstrated promise in other domains, they have not yet been applied to
ACO. In this study, we implement four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the
simulated CybORG environment and conduct a comparative evaluation. Our results
demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training
efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed,
highlighting its potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity.

TL;DR: Organ-Agents is a multi-agent LLM framework that simulates human physiology using specialized agents for different organ systems, achieving high accuracy in sepsis patient simulation and enabling counterfactual treatment analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a credible digital twin for human physiology that can simulate complex multi-system interactions, particularly for critical care scenarios like sepsis, enabling precision diagnosis and treatment simulation.

Method: Multi-agent framework with LLM-driven agents modeling specific physiological systems, trained via supervised fine-tuning on time-series data and reinforcement-guided coordination with dynamic reference selection and error correction using data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls.

Result: Achieved high simulation accuracy (MSE <0.16 per system) on 4,509 held-out patients, robust across severity strata, faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events, and enables counterfactual simulations with trajectories matching real-world patients. Physicians rated realism at 3.9/5.

Conclusion: Organ-Agents represents a credible, interpretable digital twin for critical care applications, showing preserved decision-relevant patterns in synthetic data and enabling precision diagnosis and treatment hypothesis testing.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital
twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in
critical care.

*Xin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) proposes intelligence emerges from structured reuse of prior inference trajectories rather than uniform sampling, modeling cognition as inference over latent cycles in memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational bottlenecks in modern AI and provide a biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on structure, reuse, and memory rather than ergodic sampling or optimization from scratch.

Method: MAI framework models cognition as inference over latent cycles in memory using delta-homology, representing cortical columns as local inference operators over cycle-consistent memory states, establishing time-reversal duality with reinforcement learning.

Result: MAI provides a principled foundation for Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, enables energy-efficient inference, and offers a unified theory of intelligence based on structural reuse and persistent topological memory.

Conclusion: MAI offers a biologically grounded framework for intelligence that addresses computational bottlenecks and provides a path toward artificial general intelligence through structure-preserving inference and memory-amortized computation.

Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform
sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior
inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a
formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles
in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems
encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling
context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive
systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent
manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of
delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for
Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a
local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we
establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:
whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes
backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient
inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI
thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on
structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications
of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

*Kim Hammar,Tao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOBAL is an online Bayesian learning method for cyber incident response that handles model misspecification by iteratively refining conjectures about attack models and using quantized Markov models for efficient response planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current incident response frameworks require detailed system models, limiting practical utility when attack information is incomplete or inaccurate. There's a need for methods that can operate effectively under model misspecification.

Method: MOBAL uses iterative Bayesian learning to refine conjectures about the attack model as new information becomes available. It quantizes the conjectured model into a finite Markov model to enable efficient response planning through dynamic programming.

Result: The method proves Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with information feedback and establishes bounds on misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on CAGE-2 benchmark show MOBAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adaptability and robustness to model misspecification.

Conclusion: MOBAL provides an effective online approach for incident response planning that handles model uncertainty and incomplete information, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods in realistic cyberattack scenarios.

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when
information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most
decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system
model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In
this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for
incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:
Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture
about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,
which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine
effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite
Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic
programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with
respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on
misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark
show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and
robustness to model misspecification.

Motivation: Network intrusion detection systems face challenges with contaminated and noisy data inputs, requiring more robust detection methods.

Method: Developed a probabilistic version of Temporal Graph Network Support Vector Data Description (TGN-SVDD) that predicts Gaussian distribution parameters for each network event to handle input noise.

Result: Experiments on modified CIC-IDS2017 dataset with synthetic noise showed significant detection performance improvements over baseline TGN-SVDD, especially at higher noise levels.

Conclusion: The probabilistic approach effectively enhances robustness against noisy adversarial inputs in network intrusion detection systems.

Abstract: In the domain of network intrusion detection, robustness against contaminated

experiments on a modified CIC-IDS2017 data set with synthetic noise demonstrate
significant improvements in detection performance compared to the baseline

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exact Shapley value computation for FANOVA Gaussian processes in quadratic time, enabling efficient local and global explanations with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley values provide principled feature attribution but scale exponentially with features, especially challenging for probabilistic models like GPs where outputs are random variables requiring higher-order moment computations.

Method: Leverage closed-form stochastic Möbius representation of FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive algorithms inspired by Newton's identities to compute exact Shapley values in quadratic time for both local (stochastic cooperative game) and global (variance-based value function) explanations.

Result: Achieves exact computation of Shapley attributions in quadratic time instead of exponential time, capturing both expected contributions and uncertainty for local explanations, and quantifying feature contributions to model sensitivity for global explanations.

Conclusion: Enhances explainable AI by providing scalable, axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for structured probabilistic models, making Shapley values practically applicable to complex GP models.

Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing
importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact
computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,
severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The
challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as
in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather
than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling
higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class
of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and
interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global
explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise
explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components
and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,
capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global
explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and
compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the
model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)
M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive
algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean
and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable
AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable,
axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions
generated by structured probabilistic models.

Motivation: Previous VTP models overlook traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, so this research aims to quantify model reliability in varying traffic scenarios beyond common error analyses.

Method: Uses probability of detection analysis to assess model reliability, evaluates all models on test samples categorized by traffic situation complexity during prediction horizon, and obtains performance metrics and reliability estimates for each category.

Result: Provides comprehensive evaluation showing strengths and weaknesses of different prediction approaches, along with their reliability in terms of prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be guaranteed.

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on
the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to
assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the

uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN) integrates Chebyshev polynomials into DQN framework, achieving 39% better performance than standard DQN on CartPole-v1 with optimal polynomial degree (N=4), though higher degrees can harm learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard neural networks struggle to approximate complex value functions in reinforcement learning. Chebyshev polynomials offer superior function approximation properties that could improve DQN performance.

Method: Proposed Ch-DQN architecture that replaces standard MLP with Chebyshev polynomial basis in DQN framework. Evaluated on CartPole-v1 benchmark with different polynomial degrees (N=4 and N=8) compared to standard DQN with similar parameter count.

Result: Ch-DQN with N=4 achieved approximately 39% better asymptotic performance than standard DQN. However, higher polynomial degree (N=8) was detrimental to learning, showing polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter.

Conclusion: Orthogonal polynomial bases like Chebyshev polynomials show promise for deep reinforcement learning, but require careful tuning of model complexity to balance approximation power and learning stability.

Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the
ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the
action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer
perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes
inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel
architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev
polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature
representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more
efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on
the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a
comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a
moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic
performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also
find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a
high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the
potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning
while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent and ignore hidden relationships, but concepts are often correlated in real-world scenarios.

Method: Propose GraphCBMs that construct latent concept graphs to model concept relationships, combined with traditional CBMs while maintaining interpretability.

Result: Superior performance in image classification tasks, provides concept structure information, enables more effective interventions, and shows robustness across different settings.

Conclusion: GraphCBMs successfully address the limitation of concept independence in traditional CBMs by incorporating concept relationships through latent graphs, enhancing both model performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep
neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust
final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent
given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships
among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic
structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will
inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose
GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by
constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance
model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment
results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer
the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while
providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to
utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust

### [58] [Adaptively Robust LLM Inference Optimization under Prediction Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14544)
*Zixi Chen,Yinyu Ye,Zijie Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimizing LLM inference scheduling using ML-based output length prediction to minimize latency and prevent memory overflow, with an adaptive algorithm achieving log-scale competitive ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM inference is an online multi-task service that consumes significant energy and faces uncertainty in output length prediction, making efficient scheduling crucial for reducing latency and power consumption.

Method: Propose two algorithms: A_max (conservative scheduling using upper bound prediction) and A_min (adaptive algorithm using lower bound prediction with dynamic refinement during inference).

Result: A_min achieves log-scale competitive ratio and performs nearly as well as hindsight scheduler in simulations, showing efficiency and robustness while relying only on lower bound predictions.

Conclusion: The adaptive algorithm A_min effectively addresses output length uncertainty in LLM inference scheduling, providing near-optimal performance with practical advantages over conservative approaches.

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference
scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task
service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM
processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,
it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power
consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key
challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known
upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and
processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms
that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the
prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each
request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which
schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to
prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as
prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to
potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted
lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during
inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale
competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,
highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.
Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the
prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output
length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELATE uses evolutionary framework with language model to automate time-series feature engineering, improving forecasting accuracy by 8.4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual feature engineering is time-intensive and existing automation methods are computationally costly without domain insights

Method: Evolutionary framework with language model that uses time-series statistical measures and feature importance to guide and prune features, proposing contextually relevant transformations

Result: Improves forecasting accuracy by average 8.4% across various domains

Conclusion: ELATE effectively automates time-series feature engineering with significant performance improvements

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine
learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed
to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often
manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive
enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific
insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated
Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an
evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data.
ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics
to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new,
contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that
ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various
domains.

*Valter Schütz,Han Wu,Reza Rezvan,Linus Aronsson,Morteza Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AFABench is the first standardized benchmark framework for Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) that enables systematic evaluation of feature selection methods across diverse datasets and policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active Feature Acquisition faces evaluation challenges due to lack of standardized benchmarks, making it difficult to fairly compare different methods that trade predictive performance against feature acquisition costs.

Method: The authors introduce AFABench with synthetic and real-world datasets, support for various acquisition policies (static, greedy, RL-based), and a modular design. They also create AFAContext synthetic dataset to test lookahead capabilities.

Result: The benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation of representative AFA algorithms, revealing key trade-offs between different strategies and exposing limitations of greedy selection approaches.

Conclusion: AFABench provides the first standardized evaluation framework for AFA research, offering actionable insights and facilitating future method development through its modular and extensible design.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can
be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns.
Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically
selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading
predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have
been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to
non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of
these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this
paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our
benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports
a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that
enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate
representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,
and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities
of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed
to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key
trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for
future research. The benchmark code is available at:

*Yunzhe Zhang,Yifei Wang,Khanh Vinh Nguyen,Pengyu Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMCM-DLM enables cross-modality constrained molecule generation without retraining by adding trainable control modules to a pre-trained diffusion model, handling both structural and property constraints in two distinct generation phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SMILES-based diffusion models only support unimodal constraints and require complete retraining for new constraints, but real-world applications need multiple cross-modality constraints that may emerge during studies.

Method: Builds on pre-trained diffusion model with two trainable modules: Structure Control Module (SCM) for early diffusion steps to anchor molecular backbone, and Property Control Module (PCM) for later inference stages to refine chemical properties. Operates in two phases during generation.

Result: Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of the approach for cross-modality constrained molecule generation.

Conclusion: CMCM-DLM represents a significant advancement in molecular generation for drug discovery by enabling flexible cross-modality constraint incorporation without model retraining.

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically
support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start
of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch
whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve
multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints
may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a
pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but
also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion
Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:
molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure
Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two
distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM
to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively
anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further
introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated
molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement
in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

TL;DR: PepThink-R1 is a novel generative framework that combines LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning and reinforcement learning to design therapeutic peptides with improved properties and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Therapeutic peptide design faces challenges from vast sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor interpretability of current generative models.

Method: Integrates large language models with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, explicitly reasoning about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation with tailored reward functions.

Result: Generates cyclic peptides with significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming existing general LLMs and domain-specific baselines in both optimization success and interpretability.

Conclusion: First LLM-based peptide design framework combining explicit reasoning with RL-driven property control, advancing reliable and transparent peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the
vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor
interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we
introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly
reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling
interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological
properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity
and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence
variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with
significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming
existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both
optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first
LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with
RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent
peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

TL;DR: FedRAIN-Lite uses federated reinforcement learning with latitude-based agents to enable adaptive climate model parameterization, showing DDPG outperforms traditional static methods with better accuracy and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional climate model parameterizations are static and tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving climate states, which necessitates more flexible and adaptive learning approaches.

Method: Federated reinforcement learning framework with agents assigned to latitude bands, tested on energy-balance climate model hierarchy (ebm-v1 to ebm-v3) with three RL algorithms under different FedRL configurations.

Result: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperformed static and single-agent baselines with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and mid-latitude zones across both multi-agent setups.

Conclusion: DDPG's transferability across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it suitable for geographically adaptive parameter learning, providing a scalable pathway towards high-complexity climate models with online learning capabilities.

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and
tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces
FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors
the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by
assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with
periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance
climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble
(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under
different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent
baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and
mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to
transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited
for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a
scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for
physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a
changing climate. Code accessible at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in temporal graph learning where nodes evolve over time and new nodes join continuously, specifically addressing effective representation of unseen nodes and mitigation of noisy/redundant graph information.

Method: Proposes GTGIB framework combining Graph Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). Uses a two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to optimize node neighborhoods and a TGIB that extends information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs with variational approximation for stable optimization.

Conclusion: The GTGIB framework effectively addresses inductive representation learning challenges in temporal graphs through integrated structure learning and information bottleneck techniques, demonstrating superior performance across different settings.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges
evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive
representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:
effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph
information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph
Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We
design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize
node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through
theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by
extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing
both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function
via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.
GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;
they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,
with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

*Nícolas Roque dos Santos,Dawon Ahn,Diego Minatel,Alneu de Andrade Lopes,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes GCTD, a tensor decomposition-based graph condensation method that reduces computational demands while maintaining GNN performance and improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph condensation methods rely on computationally intensive bi-level optimization and lack interpretability due to missing node mappings between synthetic and original graphs.

Method: Uses multi-view tensor decomposition techniques to synthesize a compact graph that preserves essential information from the original graph while maintaining a mapping between nodes.

Result: Achieves up to 4.0% accuracy improvement on 3 out of 6 datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Tensor decomposition techniques offer an effective alternative for graph condensation, providing both computational efficiency and improved interpretability through maintained node mappings.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various
real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social
media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to
their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant
computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and
processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce
these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the
essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's
predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation
approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level
optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and
original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this
sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn
linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent
and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph
condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a
novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition
(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an
informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.
Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD
effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up
to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive
performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeRC is an end-to-end neural framework that corrects GNSS ranging errors using ground-truth locations instead of hard-to-obtain error labels, achieving improved positioning accuracy for mobile devices in urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS localization on mobile devices suffers from accuracy issues in urban areas due to signal propagation complexity and low-quality hardware. Traditional data-driven methods require difficult-to-obtain ranging error annotations.

Method: Uses differentiable moving horizon estimation (MHE) to handle measurement horizons for positioning and backpropagate gradients. Employs Euclidean Distance Field cost maps for training with reduced location labeling requirements.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvement in positioning accuracy on public benchmarks and collected datasets. Successfully deployed on edge devices with real-time performance.

Conclusion: NeRC provides a practical end-to-end solution for GNSS error correction that bypasses the need for ranging error annotations while achieving superior accuracy and real-time capability on mobile devices.

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban
environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite
signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining
positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven
methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the
grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a
robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where
localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the
neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train
the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to
obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon
location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for
positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a
blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using
Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on
labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our
collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning
accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance
for mobile devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theoretical studies on GNN learning dynamics focus primarily on convergence rates in noise-free settings and provide only crude connections to graph structure. This paper aims to bridge the gap by investigating how graph structure influences learning algorithm performance in noisy generalization regimes.

Method: The study extends conventional learning theory settings to GNNs, analyzing excessive risk profiles of SGD and Ridge regression through spectral graph theory. It examines different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) and extends analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs.

Result: The research reveals connections between graph structure and learning algorithm performance through spectral analysis, shows how different graph structures impact algorithm performance, and identifies increasing non-isotropic effects on excess risk in multi-layer GNNs related to over-smoothing issues.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a coupling relationship among graph structure, GNNs, and learning algorithms, providing practical insights for GNN algorithm design and selection, with empirical results supporting theoretical predictions.

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph
structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the
learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning
algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude
connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum
degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk
(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the
generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional
settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine
how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several
key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure
and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and
Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure
through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further
explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the
performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing
non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights
into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning
algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,
\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs
and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and
selection in practice.}

*Junwei Su,Chuan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First non-asymptotic convergence analysis for score-based graph generative models (SGGMs), which differ from standard SGMs by using coupled SDEs for graph structure and node features. The analysis covers three generation paradigms and identifies unique convergence factors like topological properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGGMs are effective in drug discovery and protein synthesis but lack theoretical understanding of convergence behavior. Unlike standard SGMs that use a single SDE, SGGMs involve coupled SDEs for graph structure and node features, making existing convergence analyses inapplicable.

Method: Presented the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, examining convergence bounds across three graph generation paradigms: feature generation with fixed structure, structure generation with fixed features, and joint generation of both. Analyzed unique factors affecting convergence and provided theoretical insights for hyperparameter selection.

Result: The analysis revealed unique convergence factors specific to SGGMs, such as topological properties of graph structure. Theoretical predictions were validated through controlled empirical studies using synthetic graph models, with results aligning with theoretical findings.

Conclusion: This work provides the first theoretical convergence analysis for SGGMs, deepens understanding of their behavior, demonstrates applicability in critical domains, and offers practical guidance for model design including hyperparameter selection and techniques like normalization to improve convergence.

Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical
applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their
theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains
underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are
governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a
system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are
governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing
convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present
the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the
convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph
generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)
graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation
of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique
factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph
structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer
theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling
steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to
improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a
controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align
with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical
understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,
and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

TL;DR: SBGD model addresses scalability and size generalization issues in graph diffusion models by using block graph space with structural priors, achieving 6x memory reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph diffusion generative models struggle with scalability to large graphs due to high memory requirements and poor generalization to different graph sizes, limiting their real-world applications.

Method: Proposes stochastic block graph diffusion (SBGD) model that refines graph representations into block graph space with structural priors based on real-world patterns, reducing memory complexity.

Result: Achieves up to 6x memory improvements while maintaining comparable or superior generation performance, and demonstrates better generalization to unseen graph sizes.

Conclusion: SBGD provides scalable and effective graph generation while exemplifying modularization in generative modeling, offering new avenues for decomposing complex tasks.

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces
challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to
scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically
operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in
memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility
for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,
with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the
training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To
address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion
(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.
This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,
significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large
graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing
fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves
significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable
or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to
unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable
and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in
generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by
decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models can achieve high performance with far fewer latent states than traditionally assumed, even down to a single latent state, enabling 4-6x faster convergence while maintaining sample quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the fundamental assumption that diffusion models require a large number of latent states/time-steps for effective training and Gaussian reverse processes.

Method: Careful selection of noise schedules and training diffusion models with minimal latent states (as low as T=1), combining independently trained single latent-state models for complete disentanglement.

Result: Models trained with only 32 latent states match performance of models with 1000+ states. Single latent-state models produce high-quality samples and achieve 4-6x faster convergence across various metrics on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The number of latent states in diffusion models can be dramatically reduced without sacrificing performance, enabling significantly faster training and more efficient generative processes.

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

Motivation: Wearable sensor data provides opportunities for personalized health monitoring, but deriving actionable insights from complex, longitudinal data streams is challenging.

Conclusion: The framework provides a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on individual responses to lifestyle changes, showing potential for personalized insights.

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring,
yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams
is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized
counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring
what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of
lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data
from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a
temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive
relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological
changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered
relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a
counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical
interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via
one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and
impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy
(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility
(median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant
inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes,
showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides

*Shuaijie She,Yu Bao,Yu Lu,Lu Xu,Tao Li,Wenhao Zhu,Shujian Huang,Shanbo Cheng,Lu Lu,Yuxuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DuPO is a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that generates annotation-free feedback through generalized duality, eliminating the need for costly labels and expanding beyond strictly dual task pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of RLVR (requires costly labels, restricted to verifiable tasks) and traditional dual learning (limited to strictly dual task pairs like translation/back-translation).

Method: Decomposes primal task input into known/unknown components, constructs dual task to reconstruct unknown part using primal output and known information, uses reconstruction quality as self-supervised reward to optimize primal task via LLMs.

Result: Achieves 2.13 COMET improvement in translation over 756 directions, 6.4% accuracy boost in mathematical reasoning on three benchmarks, and 9.3 point improvement as inference-time reranker.

Conclusion: DuPO provides a scalable, general, and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization that works across diverse tasks without requiring labeled data.

Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

### [73] [Fast Symbolic Regression Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14481)
*Viktor Martinek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Improved symbolic regression benchmarking with curated expression lists and early termination, increasing rediscovery rates and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symbolic regression benchmarks overemphasize recovering specific expression forms, rely solely on computer algebra systems for assessment, and continue searching after discovery, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: Introduces curated lists of acceptable expressions and a callback mechanism for early termination, applied to the SRSD benchmark problems to evaluate SymbolicRegression.jl and TiSR packages.

Result: SymbolicRegression.jl's rediscovery rate increased from 26.7% to 44.7% with 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR achieved 69.4% rediscovery rate with 63% time savings.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmarking improvements significantly enhance symbolic regression algorithm performance evaluation by increasing rediscovery rates while substantially reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several
benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.
However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the
recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra
systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks
continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these
issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback
mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic
regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by
Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and
TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of
SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%.
Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's
rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

### [74] [On the notion of missingness for path attribution explainability methods in medical settings: Guiding the selection of medically meaningful baselines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14482)
*Alexander Geiger,Lars Wagner,Daniel Rueckert,Dirk Wilhelm,Alissa Jell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Counterfactual-guided baseline selection for medical AI explainability using VAE-generated clinically normal baselines instead of standard all-zero inputs, improving attribution faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard baseline choices like all-zero inputs are semantically meaningless in medical contexts where missingness itself can be informative, and existing methods lack principled dynamic baseline selection.

Method: Uses Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines that are clinically normal but input-close, representing meaningful absence of features. Concept is generative-model-agnostic.

Result: Evaluation on three medical datasets shows counterfactual baselines yield more faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline choices.

Conclusion: Counterfactual-guided baseline selection provides more accurate representation of meaningful feature absence in medical data, improving interpretability and clinical trust in deep learning models.

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge,
particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for
clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated
Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant
features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are
often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where
missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have
been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically
select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of
missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline
selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the
limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but
input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a
meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a
Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our
concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable
counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data
sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more
faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline
choices.

*Huan Ma,Jiadong Pan,Jing Liu,Yan Chen,Joey Tianyi Zhou,Guangyu Wang,Qinghua Hu,Hua Wu,Changqing Zhang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semantic Energy is a new uncertainty estimation framework that improves hallucination detection in LLMs by using logits from the penultimate layer and Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, outperforming semantic entropy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are susceptible to producing fluent but incorrect responses (hallucinations), and existing uncertainty estimation methods like semantic entropy rely on post-softmax probabilities which fail to capture the model's inherent uncertainty in certain scenarios.

Method: The proposed Semantic Energy framework leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs by operating directly on logits of the penultimate layer, combining semantic clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution to better capture uncertainty.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Semantic Energy offers more reliable uncertainty signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection, addressing limitations of previous semantic entropy approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce
fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making.
Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations.
For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic
diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations.
However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to
capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in
certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel
uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs
by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic
clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better
captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves
hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable
signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based anomaly detection method with multiscale feature perception for cloud services, outperforming baselines in precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation for anomaly detection in cloud service environments.

Method: Uses improved Transformer with self-attention for temporal modeling, multiscale feature construction through downsampling and parallel encoding, and attention-weighted fusion for dynamic scale contribution adjustment.

Result: Outperforms mainstream baseline models in precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, with strong stability under various perturbation conditions.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates superior capability for anomaly detection in complex cloud environments with robust performance across different conditions.

Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer
architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address
the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in
cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer
module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using
a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual
semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to
extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and
parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to
dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,
enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input
modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,
covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task
scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's
temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate
performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,
and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,
recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection
performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior
capability in complex cloud environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Great GATsBi is a hybrid multimodal trajectory prediction framework for bicycles that combines physics-based and social-based modeling using graph attention networks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bicycles have received little attention in trajectory prediction research despite accounting for most traffic accident fatalities, while previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles.

Method: A hybrid framework incorporating both physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) using graph attention networks that include decayed historical and anticipated future trajectory data.

Result: The ensemble of physics models (good for short-term predictions) and social models (good for long-term predictions) exceeds state-of-the-art performance, demonstrated through a controlled mass-cycling experiment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the dual nature of bicycle movement and provides superior trajectory prediction performance by combining physical and social modeling approaches.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many
applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous
driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic
accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,
as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this
work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal
trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both
physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based
modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual
nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph
attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future
trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from
psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed
ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --
and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds
state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling
experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle
trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

*Tao Shen,Zexi Li,Didi Zhu,Ziyu Zhao,Chao Wu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies period drift as a new challenge in cross-device federated learning caused by partial client participation, proposes FedEve framework to mitigate both period drift and client drift through mutual compensation, and demonstrates improved performance on non-iid data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity in federated learning causes performance degradation. While client drift from multiple local updates is known, period drift from partial client participation in cross-device FL has not been well studied and can be more harmful as it shifts optimization objectives each round.

Method: Proposes a predict-observe framework and FedEve method that allows period drift and client drift to compensate each other, reducing the variance of model updates through theoretical mechanisms.

Result: Extensive experiments show FedEve outperforms alternative methods on non-iid data in cross-device federated learning settings, with theoretical evidence supporting reduced update variance.

Conclusion: Period drift is a significant challenge in cross-device FL that interacts with client drift, and the proposed FedEve framework effectively mitigates both types of drift through mutual compensation, leading to improved performance on heterogeneous data.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private
data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in
poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized
as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple
local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift
arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied
well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients
at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that
deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift
since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client
drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on
cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these
issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated
method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to
mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our
approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in
cross-device settings.

TL;DR: A unified framework for distributed SGD algorithms with dynamic topologies and non-uniform aggregation that provides improved convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed SGD approaches assume fixed topologies and uniform node contributions, which are suboptimal. Dynamic topologies with non-uniform aggregation can significantly improve performance.

Method: Develops a unified framework covering multiple Local-Update SGD-based distributed algorithms with dynamic topologies and non-uniform client selection strategies.

Result: Provides improved or matching theoretical convergence guarantees compared to existing work, demonstrating better performance through dynamic topology management.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of fixed-topology distributed SGD by incorporating dynamic client selection and non-uniform aggregation, achieving superior convergence results.

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based
algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific
circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting
assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the
contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have
shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation
strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can
significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a
unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed
algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching
theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

*Abdalwahab Almajed,Maryam Tabar,Peyman Najafirad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study examines how different density-ratio estimation methods affect fairness measurement in regression ML models, finding significant inconsistencies that question reliability of current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Algorithmic bias in ML requires reliable fairness measurement methods. Prior research used logistic regression for density-ratio estimation in regression fairness, but the sensitivity to different estimation algorithms was unexplored.

Method: Developed multiple fairness measurement methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and experimentally compared their effects on fairness assessment outcomes.

Result: Different density-ratio estimation cores significantly affect fairness measurement results, sometimes generating inconsistent conclusions about which algorithms are more fair.

Conclusion: Current density-ratio estimation based fairness measurement methods in regression have major reliability issues and require further research to enhance their consistency and trustworthiness.

Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches
has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML
domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in
regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed
to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic
Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However,
there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of
our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness
measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation
algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement
methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates
how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our
experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core
could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and
even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of
various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio
estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further
research to enhance their reliability.

*Xudong Wang,Guoming Tang,Junyu Xue,Srinivasan Keshav,Tongxin Li,Chris Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DualNILM is a Transformer-based multi-task learning framework that simultaneously performs appliance state recognition and energy injection identification to address challenges in NILM caused by behind-the-meter energy sources like solar panels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional NILM methods suffer performance degradation due to energy injection from behind-the-meter sources (solar panels, battery storage) that obscure appliance power signatures.

Method: Deep multi-task learning framework combining sequence-to-point and sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer architecture to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in aggregate power consumption.

Result: Extensive experiments show DualNILM maintains excellent performance for both appliance state recognition and energy injection identification, significantly outperforming conventional methods.

Conclusion: DualNILM effectively addresses the challenge of behind-the-meter energy sources in NILM through a dual-task learning approach that captures complex temporal patterns in power consumption data.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

*Hugo Sales Corrêa,Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Daniel Ratton Figueiredo,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Testing Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) in similarity choice data using classical goodness-of-fit and Bayesian Posterior Predictive Checks, finding significant IIA violations driven by context effects rather than population heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Similarity choice data (e.g., information retrieval, embedding learning) assumes IIA, but this assumption hasn't been properly tested in target-dependent choice settings where IIA violations are likely but difficult to detect.

Method: Proposed two statistical tests: classical goodness-of-fit test and Bayesian Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC) to quantify IIA violations. Curated two datasets - one designed to elicit IIA violations, another with random choice sets. Also developed PPC test for population homogeneity.

Result: Significant IIA violations found in both datasets with comparable degree of violation. Population homogeneity confirmed, indicating violations are driven by context effects (interactions within choice sets) rather than population differences.

Conclusion: Current similarity choice models assuming IIA are inadequate. Need new models that account for context effects within choice sets to better capture human similarity-based decision making.

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information
retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of
similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a
property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been
detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has
received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the
choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for
IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the
framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our
main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its
mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to
elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the
same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both
datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.
Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that
the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.
These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account
for such context effects.

TL;DR: Proposes FEXAI framework combining fuzzy logic, ML, and SHAP analysis to explain factors affecting Continuous Descent Operations performance, achieving >90% accuracy with interpretable rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research on CDO performance factors, and existing trajectory optimization methods lack transparency critical for aviation safety and stakeholder trust.

Method: Collected 1,094 flights data with 29 features (11 operational, 18 weather), applied ML models and SHAP analysis to classify CDO adherence, then built fuzzy rule-based classifier using top 3 influential features.

Result: All models achieved >90% accuracy. Top predictors: average descent rate, number of descent segments, and average change in directional heading during descent. FEXAI provided human-readable interpretable rules.

Conclusion: FEXAI offers novel operational decision support pathway that could enable real-time CDO adherence advisories under varying conditions while maintaining explainability for aviation safety.

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that
avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving
efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental
benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing
CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as
trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where
explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study
addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)
framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive
dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related
features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then
applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by
importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,
were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the
extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification
accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for
operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the
arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in
directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO
performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway
for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to
enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying
operational conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using hyperbolic embeddings from SNOMED taxonomy improves lung cancer prediction models by preserving semantic relationships between medical concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clinical prediction models ignore semantic relationships between clinical concepts, limiting their ability to leverage domain-specific knowledge from medical terminologies like SNOMED.

Method: Mapped SNOMED medical term hierarchy into low-dimensional hyperbolic space using Poincaré embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent, then incorporated these embeddings into ResNet and Transformer deep learning architectures.

Result: Poincaré embeddings provided modest but consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models with 10-dimensional Poincaré embeddings showed enhanced calibration, while Transformers maintained stable calibration.

Conclusion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and integrating them with deep learning models improves lung cancer onset prediction by preserving hierarchical structure of clinical terminologies, combining data-driven feature extraction with clinical knowledge.

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data
using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical
concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping
the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using
Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived
a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e
embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were
then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a
Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute
difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest
and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline
models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,
particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced
calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across
configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and
integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung
cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical
terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method
for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical
knowledge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diff-In: A scalable second-order method for estimating sample influence in neural networks without requiring convex loss functions, achieving higher accuracy than existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to first-order approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data analysis tools for AI model training suffer from accuracy limitations and often assume convex loss functions, which makes them ineffective for modern neural networks that typically have non-convex loss landscapes.

Method: Proposes Diff-In, which approximates sample influence by accumulating differences in influence between consecutive training steps using second-order approximations. The method computes Hessian-gradient products efficiently through finite differences of first-order gradients, eliminating the need for convexity assumptions.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows significantly lower approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance in data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset selection across multiple benchmark datasets. Successfully scales to millions of data points in large-scale vision-language pre-training tasks.

Conclusion: Diff-In provides an accurate, scalable, and computationally efficient approach for sample influence estimation in non-convex neural networks, outperforming existing methods while maintaining practical computational requirements.

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs exhibit bias in predictions based on sensitive attributes like race and gender, which can be exacerbated by graph structure and message-passing mechanisms. Existing bias mitigation methods may unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, compromising the balance between accuracy and fairness.

Method: Utilizes counterfactual data augmentation to create diverse neighborhoods before message passing, facilitating unbiased node representations. Employs an adversarial discriminator to diminish bias in predictions from conventional GNN classifiers.

Result: Experiments on standard datasets with three GNN backbones show Fair-ICD significantly enhances fairness metrics while preserving high predictive performance.

Conclusion: Fair-ICD effectively ensures fairness in GNNs under moderate conditions, achieving better balance between fairness and accuracy compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling
graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs
can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.
Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and
message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias
by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge
dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may
unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised
balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we
present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias
mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using
counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node
representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial
discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN
classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs
under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN
backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while
preserving high predictive performance.

*Zengyi Wo,Wenjun Wang,Minglai Shao,Chang Liu,Yumeng Wang,Yueheng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CES2-GAD, a spectral neural network using causal edge separation for anomaly detection on heterophilic graphs where anomalous nodes hide connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based anomaly detection methods fail on heterophilic graphs where anomalous entities add legitimate connections while hiding direct anomalous links, and current approaches overlook spectral domain analysis.

Method: Separates original graph into homophilic/heterophilic edges using causal interventions, applies hybrid-spectrum filters to capture signals from segmented graphs, then concatenates representations for classification.

Result: Extensive experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CES2-GAD method.

Conclusion: The spectral approach with causal edge separation effectively addresses heterophilic graph anomaly detection by capturing frequency shifts caused by anomalous node behavior.

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections
while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to
heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques
fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the
spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships
between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual
environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral
domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral
distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that
the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low
to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral
neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection
on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into
homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently,
various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented
graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and
input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with
real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

Motivation: LLM-generated reasoning graphs are often misaligned with downstream visual tasks, and existing graph refinement methods are unsuitable for these novel, dataset-less graphs.

Method: Propose Data-driven GSR (D-GSR) paradigm that directly optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, implemented through MissionHD - a hyperdimensional computing framework with efficient encode-decode process guided by task signals.

Conclusion: D-GSR with MissionHD framework serves as an effective pre-processing step for refining LLM-generated graphs to better align with downstream visual tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with

*Thomas Carta,Clément Romac,Loris Gaven,Pierre-Yves Oudeyer,Olivier Sigaud,Sylvain Lamprier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HERAKLES is a hierarchical autotelic framework that compiles mastered goals into low-level policies and uses an LLM as high-level controller to handle increasing goal complexity in open-ended environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-ended AI agents need to efficiently learn increasingly complex and heterogeneous goals while controlling sample and computational complexity growth. Existing hierarchical approaches rely on expert-defined subgoal spaces and pre-trained policies, which are inadequate for diverse goal spaces.

Method: Two-level hierarchical architecture where mastered goals are continuously compiled into a small, fast low-level neural network policy. A Large Language Model serves as the high-level controller for goal decomposition and generalization over the evolving subgoal space.

Result: HERAKLES scales effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill compilation, and enables robust adaptation to novel challenges in the open-ended Crafter environment.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of growing goal complexity in autotelic agents by dynamically expanding subgoal spaces and leveraging LLMs for hierarchical control, demonstrating effective scaling and adaptation capabilities.

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing
complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling
efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to
keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated
growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent
approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and
language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization
capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing
approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a
hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such
designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally
diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a
framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously
compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast
neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the
high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the
high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and
generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We
evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales
effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill
compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over
time.

*Ahmed Mujtaba,Gleb Radchenko,Radu Prodan,Marc Masana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EdgeFD is a resource-efficient federated distillation method that uses KMeans-based density ratio estimation to filter proxy data on clients, eliminating complex statistical estimators and server-side filtering while maintaining high accuracy across diverse data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated distillation methods use computationally expensive statistical density ratio estimators for selective knowledge sharing and require server-side filtering, creating latency and complexity issues that limit practical deployment on edge devices.

Method: Proposes EdgeFD with an efficient KMeans-based density ratio estimator that filters both in-distribution and out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, removing the need for server-side filtering and complex statistical estimators.

Result: EdgeFD outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenarios (strong non-IID, weak non-IID, IID), achieving accuracy close to IID scenarios under heterogeneous conditions with significantly reduced computational overhead.

Conclusion: EdgeFD enhances scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation by providing a resource-efficient solution suitable for deployment on constrained edge devices while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine
learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced
communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model
outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing
methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require
clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally
expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side
filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address
these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that
reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes
the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based
density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality
of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,
including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,
without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge
distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID
scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The
significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing
the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The
code is available online for reproducibility.

### [92] [Context Steering: A New Paradigm for Compression-based Embeddings by Synthesizing Relevant Information Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14780)
*Guillermo Sarasa Durán,Ana Granados Fontecha,Francisco de Borja Rodríguez Ortíz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Context steering is a novel methodology that actively guides compression-based distance features to better align with specific classification/clustering tasks, rather than passively accepting emergent data structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compression-based distances provide flexible similarity measures but often fail to align well with specific tasks because features emerge from data rather than being defined for the objective.

Method: Systematically analyzes how each object influences relational context within clustering to steer the feature-shaping process, generating custom embeddings that amplify class-distinctive information using NCD and NRC with hierarchical clustering.

Result: Experimental validation across heterogeneous datasets (text and audio) shows robustness and generality, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.

Conclusion: Represents a fundamental shift from merely discovering inherent data structures to actively shaping feature spaces tailored to specific objectives.

Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means
of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through
redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived
from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to
align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or
classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context
steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping
process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically
a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by
systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context
within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored
embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We
validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression
Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical
clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.
Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world
audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a
fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data
structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific
objective.

Motivation: Conventional model distillation approaches suffer from computational overhead and limited generalization, needing more efficient methods for resource-constrained deployment

Method: Dynamic data augmentation in high-loss regions using UMAP dimensionality reduction and nearest neighbor sampling, plus lightweight teacher-student interface bypassing teacher's input layer for direct vectorized distillation

Result: 66M-parameter student model achieves 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3% on SST-2, matching or surpassing baselines with fewer training epochs

Conclusion: Loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation show promise for efficient and effective model compression

Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models
to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained
environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from
computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive
distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of
high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest
neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the
embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student
learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling
direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard
NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently
matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%
on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise
of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and
effective model compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high demand for manually annotated image data lacks comprehensive guidelines for managing complex annotation projects, which involve diverse challenges outside typical domain expertise.

Method: Drawing from extensive experience managing large annotation projects, the paper provides domain-agnostic guidance covering success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data availability, team roles, human biases, and recommended tools/technologies.

Result: The paper offers practical preparation guidelines and recommendations to improve annotation quality and efficiency in scientific imagery projects.

Conclusion: This work aims to encourage further research and frameworks for creating comprehensive knowledge bases to reduce costs of manual annotation projects across various fields.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex
and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to
the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and
interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific
domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range
widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from
mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper
provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a
focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in
managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts
including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data
availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various
human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation
quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and
frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of
manual annotation projects across various fields.

*Zifan Wang,Alice Harting,Matthieu Barreau,Michael M. Zavlanos,Karl H. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGFM modifies source distribution instead of vector field for guidance, enabling flexible sampling methods while preserving exact target distribution recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional guidance methods modify probability flow vector fields, which can be complex and restrictive. SGFM aims to simplify guidance by working directly with source distributions while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Method: Proposes Source-Guided Flow Matching framework that keeps pre-trained vector field intact and modifies source distribution. Reduces guidance to sampling from source distribution with various sampling method options.

Result: Theoretical proof of exact target distribution recovery. Bounds on Wasserstein error for approximate cases. Experimental validation on 2D benchmarks, image datasets, and physics-informed tasks shows effectiveness and flexibility.

Conclusion: SGFM provides a flexible and theoretically sound alternative to traditional guidance methods, preserving straight transport maps and allowing users to choose appropriate sampling methods for their specific problems.

Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the
probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this
paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,
which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained
vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined
problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that
SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide
bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an
approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.
The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose
the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we
systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for
asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with
optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the
vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,
image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

*Chen-Hao Chang,Hui-Ju Hung,Chia-Hsun Lu,Chih-Ya Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses two weaknesses in contrastive learning for link prediction: lack of theoretical analysis and inadequate consideration of node degrees. It provides the first formal theoretical analysis and proposes Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA) and CoEBA approach to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning approaches for link prediction lack theoretical analysis and fail to properly consider node degrees, which limits their effectiveness and understanding.

Method: Proposes Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA) to adjust node degrees during graph augmentation, and develops Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA) with new contrastive losses.

Result: Experiments on 8 benchmark datasets show that CoEBA significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

Conclusion: The proposed theoretical analysis and EBA-based approach effectively address the identified weaknesses and substantially improve link prediction performance through better handling of node degrees in contrastive learning.

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which
motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the
performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the
lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and
ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To
address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis
for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can
generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive
learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph
augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the
node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,
named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),
that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to
improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.
The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the
other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

*Jihao Andreas Lin,Nicolas Mayoraz,Steffen Rendle,Dima Kuzmin,Emil Praun,Berivan Isik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using learning curve predictions with Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes to guide Successive Halving helps prevent premature pruning of slow-starting hyperparameters, but requires fully observed training data and isn't Pareto optimal compared to simply allocating more resources to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Successive Halving often prunes promising hyperparameters too early because it relies on intermediate performance values, potentially eliminating slow starters that would eventually become optimal.

Method: Proposes using Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes to predict learning curves and guide resource allocation in Successive Halving, comparing this predictive approach against standard performance-based methods.

Result: The predictive approach achieves competitive performance but is not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into standard Successive Halving, as it requires fully observed learning curves for training.

Conclusion: While learning curve prediction helps prevent premature pruning, the method's dependency on complete training data limits its advantage; leveraging existing learning curve data could mitigate this limitation.

Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization
which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However,
the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make
resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow
starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate
whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on
Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a
large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures
and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the
standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show
that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is
not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard
approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data.
However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve
data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Amortized Model Ensembling (AME), a data-free method for averaging neural network weights from multiple pretrained models trained on disjoint data, outperforming individual models and model soup baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To define and solve the problem of neural averaging - synthesizing a single neural network from multiple pretrained models without access to training data, building on insights from model soup techniques.

Method: Proposes AME framework that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide weight updates through data-free meta-optimization, enabling more expressive ensembling strategies than model soup.

Result: AME produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual expert models and model soup baselines, particularly in out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: Provides a principled and generalizable framework for data-free model weight aggregation, establishing a formal definition of neural averaging.

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem
of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models,
each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no
access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take
insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a
singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we
reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized
Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization
approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural
weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but
enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME
produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and
model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results
suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight
aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

Abstract: Accurately predicting enzyme functionality remains one of the major

graph structures, and 2D molecular image representations. Quantum Vision
Transformer (QVT) backbone equipped with modality-specific encoders and a

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an intrinsic optimization method using exponentiated gradient descent with Bregman projection to generate effective jailbreak suffixes for LLMs, achieving higher success rates and faster convergence than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks despite alignment techniques like RLHF. Existing methods are inefficient in discrete token spaces or face challenges when projecting continuous embeddings back to discrete tokens for proprietary models.

Method: Direct optimization of relaxed one-hot encodings of adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring optimization stays within the probability simplex.

Result: Achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to three state-of-the-art baselines on five open-source LLMs and four adversarial behavior datasets. Also generates universal adversarial suffixes effective across multiple prompts with transferability to different LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed intrinsic optimization method provides an effective and efficient approach for jailbreaking LLMs, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and showing transferability across models and prompts.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major
challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers
appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on
inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of
continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to
selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary
models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete
tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.
We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed
one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient
descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot
encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We
provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement
an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.
Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to
three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four
adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In
addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial
suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of
optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

TL;DR: Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM) use anisotropic noise scaling along data principal components instead of isotropic Gaussian noise, improving FID by up to 15% on image datasets without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models use isotropic Gaussian noise that ignores data structure. Inspired by quantum squeezed states and Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the authors propose data-dependent noise scaling to enhance signal-to-noise ratio and improve feature learning.

Method: Two configurations: (1) Heisenberg diffusion model with compensating scaling (inverse scaling on orthogonal directions), and (2) standard SDM that scales only the principal axis. Applied to CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64 datasets.

Result: Mild antisqueezing (increasing variance on principal axis) consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts precision-recall frontier toward higher recall.

Conclusion: Simple, data-aware noise shaping can deliver robust generative performance improvements without requiring architectural modifications to diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As model training becomes increasingly expensive, there's a need for compute-optimal scaling approaches in reinforcement learning, similar to what has been well-studied in language modeling but lacking in RL.

Method: The study analyzes the interplay between model size, batch size, and update-to-data (UTD) ratio for online value-based deep RL methods, identifying a phenomenon called TD-overfitting and providing guidelines for compute allocation.

Result: The research reveals that increasing batch size quickly harms Q-function accuracy for small models (TD-overfitting), but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use of large batch sizes at scale.

Conclusion: The findings provide grounded guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD ratio to optimize compute usage in deep RL, establishing a foundation for compute-optimal scaling similar to supervised learning but adapted to temporal difference learning.

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes
increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and
more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal
performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for
language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in
this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,
value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute
allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed
compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes
to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between
model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we
call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for
small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use
of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this
phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize
compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for
compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning
but adapted to TD learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms have shortcomings in addressing cooperative behavior among agents, limiting their effectiveness in collaborative environments.

Method: Based on MADDPG framework, introduced a new parameter to increase rewards when cooperative behavior is identified among agents in multi-agent environments.

Result: The improved algorithm achieved higher team rewards and individual rewards compared to MADDPG when tested in PettingZoo environments.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully enhances cooperative behavior in multi-agent systems, leading to improved performance in both collective and individual outcomes.

Abstract: We propose an improved algorithm by identifying and encouraging cooperative
behavior in multi-agent environments. First, we analyze the shortcomings of
existing algorithms in addressing multi-agent reinforcement learning problems.
Then, based on the existing algorithm MADDPG, we introduce a new parameter to
increase the reward that an agent can obtain when cooperative behavior among
agents is identified. Finally, we compare our improved algorithm with MADDPG in
environments from PettingZoo. The results show that the new algorithm helps
agents achieve both higher team rewards and individual rewards.
