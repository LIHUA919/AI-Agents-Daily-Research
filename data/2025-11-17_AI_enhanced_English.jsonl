Assume-guarantee reasoning can be of great help here, providing a way to decompose the complex problem into a small set of easier subproblems.\n  In this paper, we propose several schemes for assume-guarantee verification of probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information. We prove the soundness of the schemes, and discuss their completeness. On the way, we also propose a new variant of (non-probabilistic) alternating-time logic, where the strategic modalities capture \"achieving at most $\\varphi$,\" analogous to Levesque's logic of \"only knowing.\"", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes assume-guarantee verification schemes for probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information, proving soundness and discussing completeness.", "motivation": "Model checking strategic abilities is computationally hard, especially with imperfect information and stochastic environments.
