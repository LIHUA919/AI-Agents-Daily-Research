This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance.\n  Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks.\n  This thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results.

In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, these problems are often addressed by incorporating intrinsic drives that encourage prosocial or fair behavior.

In this work, we introduce asymmetric variants of well-known SSD environments and examine how natural differences between agents influence cooperation dynamics. Our findings reveal that existing fairness-based methods struggle to adapt under asymmetric conditions by enforcing raw equality that wrongfully incentivize defection.

The forward direction, i.e., computing output quantities from design parameters, typically requires running a numerical simulation, such as a FEM, as an intermediate step, which is an optimization problem by itself. In many scenarios, several design parameters can lead to the same or similar output values. For such cases, multi-modal probabilistic approaches are advantageous to obtain diverse solutions. A major difficulty in inverse design stems from the structure of the design space, since discrete parameters or further constraints disallow the direct use of gradient-based optimization. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel inverse design method based on diffusion models. Our approach relaxes the original design space into a continuous grid representation, where gradients can be computed by implicit differentiation in the forward simulation. A diffusion model is trained on this relaxed parameter space in order to serve as a prior for plausible relaxed designs. Parameters are sampled by guided diffusion using gradients that are propagated from an objective function specified at inference time through the differentiable simulation. A design sample is obtained by backprojection into the original parameter space. We develop our approach for a composite material design problem where the forward process is modeled as a linear FEM problem. We evaluate the performance of our approach in finding designs that match a specified bulk modulus.

However, fairness in itself is not the ultimate objective for many platforms, as users do not suddenly reward the platform simply because exposure is equalized.

The authors aim to unify prior arguments and empirically test the SAH by measuring how much additional information (complexity) is needed to achieve high performance on tasks after pre-training.", "method": "The authors propose a new metric called 'task complexity', defined as the length of the shortest program that achieves target performance on a task. They estimate task complexity for mathematical reasoning, machine translation, and instruction following by measuring the program length needed when conditioned on a pre-trained model. They compare complexities before and after post-training.", "result": "Experimental results show that task complexity can be remarkably low when conditioned on a pre-trained model. Pre-training enables access to strong performance but may require programs of gigabytes in length to achieve it. Post-training collapses the complexity by several orders of magnitude, often reducing it to just a few kilobytes.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that while pre-training provides access to high performance, it often requires extremely long programs (gigabytes) to achieve it. In contrast, post-training drastically reduces the complexity (to just kilobytes) needed to reach the same performance. This supports the superficial alignment hypothesis by showing that adaptation to tasks requires surprisingly little additional information, often just a few kilobytes."}}
