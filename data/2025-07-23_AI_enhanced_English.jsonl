The advent of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to\nengage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This\npaper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these\nproblem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces\naddressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the\nformer problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter\nrequires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking\ninto account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural\nlanguage. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects\nsolution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions\nfrom the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language\nsolutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality\ndimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual\ndiversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.\nEmotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable\nmetric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures. The concepts\nintroduced in this work will provide a more rigorous understanding of the\ncapabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the age of\nLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a unified framework to understand the fundamental differences between classical formal computation and Large Language Models (LLMs) in problem-solving, introducing metrics to evaluate the quality of solutions in ambiguous, subjective domains that LLMs can address but classical systems cannot.", "motivation": "Classical computation excels at problems with unambiguous rules but fails to address a vast range of human problems characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments, and subjective context.
