### [1] [Fuzzy, Symbolic, and Contextual: Enhancing LLM Instruction via Cognitive Scaffolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21204)
*Vanessa Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a symbolic scaffolding mechanism with short-term memory to improve LLMs' cognitive behavior in Socratic tutoring, showing that architectural scaffolds shape emergent instructional strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior of large language models in instructional dialogue, specifically focusing on structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring.

Method: Introduces symbolic scaffolding with short-term memory schema, uses controlled ablation across five system variants, and evaluates outputs via expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory using an LLM-based evaluation framework.

Result: The full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity.

Conclusion: Architectural scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs, supporting a processing-level account of how inductive biases influence model behavior.

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

*Tingxuan Xu,Jiarui Feng,Justin Melendez,Kaleigh Roberts,Donghong Cai,Mingfang Zhu,Donald Elbert,Yixin Chen,Randall J. Bateman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evaluation of GraphRAG systems for Alzheimer's disease research, comparing response quality and traceability against standard GPT-4o using expert-curated questions and database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based chatbots face limitations in scientific research due to hallucinations, limited domain knowledge, and lack of explainability, particularly in knowledge-intensive biomedical domains like Alzheimer's disease.

Method: Compiled 50 papers and 70 expert questions on Alzheimer's disease, constructed GraphRAG knowledge base, used GPT-4o as LLM, compared GraphRAG responses with standard GPT-4o, and evaluated traceability of RAG/GraphRAG systems.

Result: The study assessed the quality and traceability of GraphRAG systems compared to standard LLM approaches, though specific quantitative results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: Provides an easy-to-use interface with pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test standard RAG and GraphRAG performance, demonstrating practical application for biomedical research.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

### [3] [Automated Clinical Problem Detection from SOAP Notes using a Collaborative Multi-Agent LLM Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21803)
*Yeawon Lee,Xiaoyang Wang,Christopher C. Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent system that simulates clinical team reasoning improves diagnostic accuracy for congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis by analyzing SOAP note sections through hierarchical debate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical narrative interpretation is critical but complex, and single LLM approaches lack the robustness needed for high-stakes clinical tasks. Multi-agent collaboration can better simulate real clinical team reasoning.

Method: A collaborative multi-agent system with a Manager agent orchestrating dynamically assigned specialist agents who engage in hierarchical, iterative debate to reach consensus on clinical problem identification from S and O sections of SOAP notes.

Result: The dynamic multi-agent configuration demonstrated consistently improved performance over single-agent baseline on 420 MIMIC-III notes for identifying congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis shows effective evidence weighing but occasional groupthink susceptibility.

Conclusion: Modeling clinical team reasoning through multi-agent systems offers a promising path toward more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

### [5] [Multi-Ontology Integration with Dual-Axis Propagation for Medical Concept Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21320)
*Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi,Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam,Dongjie Wang,Zijun Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINKO is an LLM-augmented framework that integrates multiple medical ontologies through dual-axis knowledge propagation (intra-ontology vertical and inter-ontology horizontal) to enhance medical concept representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single ontology systems or multiple ontologies in isolation, missing cross-ontology connections that could enrich medical concept representations.

Method: Uses LLMs for graph-retrieval-augmented initialization of concept embeddings, then performs dual-axis knowledge propagation: vertical within ontology hierarchies and horizontal across different ontologies at each level.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines on two public datasets, with enhanced robustness in limited data scenarios and rare disease prediction.

Conclusion: LINKO effectively integrates multiple medical ontologies through dual-axis propagation, serving as a plug-in encoder that improves EHR predictive models, particularly in data-scarce and rare disease contexts.

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

### [6] [Think in Games: Learning to Reason in Games via Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21365)
*Yi Liao,Yu Gu,Yuan Sui,Zining Zhu,Yifan Lu,Guohua Tang,Zhongqian Sun,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TiG framework enables LLMs to develop procedural knowledge through game interaction, combining language modeling with reinforcement learning for efficient decision-making with natural language explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at complex reasoning but struggle with simple interactive tasks that require procedural knowledge, highlighting a gap between declarative and procedural understanding.

Method: TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as language modeling, where LLMs generate language-guided policies refined through online reinforcement learning with environmental feedback.

Result: TiG achieves competitive performance with significantly lower data and computational requirements compared to conventional RL methods, while providing step-by-step natural language explanations.

Conclusion: TiG successfully bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, enabling LLMs to convert static knowledge into dynamic decision-making while maintaining transparency and interpretability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

### [7] [AHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21376)
*Tony Lee,Haoqin Tu,Chi Heem Wong,Zijun Wang,Siwei Yang,Yifan Mai,Yuyin Zhou,Cihang Xie,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AHELM is a comprehensive benchmark for audio-language models that standardizes evaluation across 10 important aspects including perception, reasoning, fairness, and safety, using aggregated datasets and standardized prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of audio-language models lack standardization, measure limited capabilities, and omit important aspects like fairness and safety, making model comparisons difficult.

Method: Created AHELM benchmark that aggregates various datasets including 2 new synthetic ones (PARADE for stereotype avoidance and CoRe-Bench for reasoning), standardizes prompts/inference parameters, and evaluates 14 ALMs across 10 aspects.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro ranked top in 5/10 aspects but showed group unfairness on ASR tasks, while baseline systems performed surprisingly well with one ranking 5th overall despite limited capabilities.

Conclusion: AHELM provides a standardized, holistic evaluation framework for ALMs that reveals important performance characteristics and fairness issues, and will be maintained as a living benchmark with ongoing updates.

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

### [10] [A General Framework of Epistemic Forgetting and its Instantiation by Ranking Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21441)
*Christoph Beierle,Alexander Hahn,Diana Howey,Gabriele Kern-Isberner,Kai Sauerwald*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes forgetting operations in epistemic states, proposing five general types and seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking functions, with a comprehensive evaluation against postulates from logic programming and AGM theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study forgetting operations from an epistemic perspective in richer semantic structures beyond classical logics, bridging the gap between syntactical variable elimination and AGM contraction while providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating different forgetting operators.

Method: The authors take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic states with clear links to propositional logic. They present five general types of epistemic forgetting and instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking functions. They propose axioms inspired by postulates from both logic programming and AGM theory for evaluation.

Result: The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of all concrete forgetting operations against all proposed postulates, resulting in a novel overview that highlights differences and commonalities among the various forgetting operators.

Conclusion: The research successfully lifts well-known and novel forgetting operations to the epistemic level, providing a rich landscape of axioms and a comprehensive framework for understanding and comparing different approaches to forgetting in epistemic states.

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

### [11] [Learning Lifted Action Models From Traces of Incomplete Actions and States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21449)
*Niklas Jansen,Jonas Gösgens,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Learning lifted STRIPS models from partial state-action traces where some predicates and action arguments are missing, using a new STRIPS+ formalism and SYNTH algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the realistic scenario where observed states don't contain all STRIPS predicates and actions don't reveal all required arguments, which previous approaches didn't fully handle.

Method: Introduce STRIPS+ formalism allowing implicit action arguments and limited existential quantification. Develop SYNTH algorithm that constructs stratified precondition expressions to ground implicit arguments.

Result: SYNTH algorithm is proven correct and complete, and tested for scalability on traces from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

Conclusion: The approach successfully handles learning from more realistic partial observations by extending STRIPS with implicit arguments and developing a sound learning algorithm.

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

### [12] [MMSearch-Plus: A Simple Yet Challenging Benchmark for Multimodal Browsing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21475)
*Xijia Tao,Yihua Teng,Xinxing Su,Xinyu Fu,Jihao Wu,Chaofan Tao,Ziru Liu,Haoli Bai,Rui Liu,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus is a challenging multimodal web browsing benchmark with 311 tasks requiring fine-grained visual reasoning, iterative text-image search, and cross-validation under retrieval noise, designed to test genuine multimodal understanding beyond shallow workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow workflows using high-recall image search and text-masking, failing to test genuine multimodal challenges like fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance verification, and long-horizon tool use.

Method: Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation curation procedure creates questions requiring extrapolation from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts, signage) and temporal traces to out-of-image facts. Provides model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools.

Result: Strongest agent (o3) achieved 15.1% without search and 36.0% with rollout. Open-source model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) got 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20 search rounds. Error analysis revealed failures in source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

Conclusion: MMSearch-Plus effectively exposes limitations in current MLLMs' multimodal reasoning capabilities, demonstrating the need for improved fine-grained visual understanding, iterative search strategies, and long-horizon planning in web agent tasks.

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

### [13] [Modeling Wise Decision Making: A Z-Number Fuzzy Framework Inspired by Phronesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21517)
*Sweta Kaman,Ankita Sharma,Romi Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A computational framework using fuzzy Z-numbers to measure wisdom as a multidimensional construct with both wisdom scores and confidence levels, validated through moral dilemma tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wisdom measures rely on self-reports and fail to capture the inherent uncertainty and humility in wise reasoning. A computational approach could improve psychological measurement and enable more humane AI systems.

Method: Fuzzy inference system with Z-numbers (wisdom score + confidence score). Participants responded to moral dilemma tasks, responses were mapped to 5 wisdom components, combined using 21 rules with Gaussian kernel density estimation.

Result: System produced dual-attribute wisdom representations that showed modest but significant correlations with established scales and negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting convergent and divergent validity.

Conclusion: Formalizes wisdom as multidimensional and uncertainty-conscious using Z-numbers, advancing psychological measurement and providing AI systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that bridges computational rigor and human judgment.

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

### [14] [Counterfactual Scenarios for Automated Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21521)
*Nicola Gigante,Francesco Leofante,Andrea Micheli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel counterfactual scenario explanation paradigm for automated planning that identifies minimal modifications to planning problems to achieve desired plan properties, showing computational viability comparable to plan computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional counterfactual explanations in automated planning only show minimal plan modifications for different goals, but fail to capture higher-level problem properties. This limitation motivates a new explanation approach.

Method: Two qualitative instantiations of counterfactual scenarios based on explicit quantification over plans that must satisfy desired properties (ψ). The approach identifies minimal modifications to planning problem P to admit plans complying with ψ.

Result: The computational complexity analysis shows that generating counterfactual scenarios is often only as expensive as computing a plan for P, demonstrating practical viability.

Conclusion: The proposed counterfactual scenario framework provides a practical and computationally viable approach for explaining automated planning systems by identifying minimal problem modifications to achieve desired plan properties.

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

*Eduardo Illueca-Fernandez,Kaile Chen,Fernando Seoane,Farhad Abtahi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthProcessAI is a GenAI framework that simplifies healthcare process mining by integrating LLMs for automated interpretation and report generation, validated with sepsis data showing Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro as top performers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Process mining in healthcare faces barriers including technical complexity, lack of standardization, and limited training resources, making it inaccessible to many potential users.

Method: Developed a comprehensive wrapper around PM4PY (Python) and bupaR (R) libraries, integrated multiple LLMs through OpenRouter platform for automated process map interpretation and report generation, validated using sepsis progression data across four proof-of-concept scenarios.

Result: Framework successfully processed sepsis data with robust technical performance. LLM evaluation showed Claude Sonnet-4 (3.79/4.0) and Gemini 2.5-Pro (3.65/4.0) achieved highest consistency scores. Automated LLM analysis effectively generated interpretable reports.

Conclusion: The integration of structured analytics with AI-driven interpretation represents a novel methodological advance for translating complex process mining results into actionable healthcare insights, making the technology more accessible to diverse users.

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

### [16] [Revisiting Landmarks: Learning from Previous Plans to Generalize over Problem Instances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21564)
*Issa Hanou,Sebastijan Dumančić,Mathijs de Weerdt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for learning generalized landmarks from solved instances that capture domain patterns and repetition, enabling effective planning heuristics for new problems in the same domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional landmark extraction algorithms struggle with planning problems that require generalization across instances. There's a need for landmarks that can capture domain-specific patterns and repetition to improve planning efficiency.

Method: Learn state functions from solved instances that are object-independent, construct a directed generalized landmark graph showing landmark progression with loop possibilities for repetitive subplans, and use this graph as a heuristic for solving new problem instances.

Result: Generalized landmark graphs learned from small instances are effective for larger instances in the same domain. When repetition loops are identified, there is significant heuristic performance improvement over baseline methods.

Conclusion: Generalized landmarks provide interpretable domain information that can be automatically discovered from a small set of plans and significantly enhance automated planning performance, particularly in domains with repetitive patterns.

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many multi-agent planning problems like multi-robot navigation can be effectively modeled with deterministic actions and observations, but current Dec-POMDP solvers struggle with large-scale instances.

Method: Proposes Iterative Deterministic POMDP Planning (IDPP) method, building on Joint Equilibrium Search for Policies framework, specifically optimized for Det-Dec-POMDPs.

Result: IDPP enables efficient solving of large-scale Det-Dec-POMDP problems that current Dec-POMDP solvers cannot handle effectively.

Conclusion: The Det-Dec-POMDP framework and IDPP solver provide a practical approach for scalable multi-agent planning in deterministic domains like multi-robot navigation.

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between complex operations research outputs and business stakeholder understanding by making optimization results more accessible

Method: Combines mixed-integer optimization model for inventory redistribution with LLMs for natural language summaries, contextual visualizations, and tailored KPIs. Uses AI agents, RESTful APIs, and dynamic UI for real-time interaction

Result: Case study demonstrates improved planning outcomes including stockout prevention, cost reduction, and service level maintenance

Conclusion: Framework successfully integrates optimization with LLMs for better decision support, with future extensions planned for enhanced explainability and real-time capabilities

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

*Ramkumar Natarajan,Muhammad Suhail Saleem,William Xiao,Sandip Aine,Howie Choset,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*) to an anytime algorithm called A-MHA* that finds feasible suboptimal solutions quickly and continually improves them over time, inspired by Anytime Repairing A* concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible heuristics for faster suboptimal solutions but is a one-shot algorithm that doesn't improve solutions over time and requires careful parameter tuning.

Method: Adapts Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*) concepts into the MHA* framework to create an anytime version that preserves suboptimality and completeness guarantees while enabling continual solution improvement.

Result: A-MHA* successfully extends MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion, maintaining original guarantees while providing continual solution refinement in both 3D path planning and sliding tiles puzzle domains.

Conclusion: The adaptation preserves MHA*'s suboptimal and completeness properties while adding anytime capabilities, making it more practical for real-world applications where solution quality can be improved over available computation time.

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

*Farhad Abtahi,Mehdi Astaraki,Fernando Seoane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEDLEY is a medical AI framework that preserves diverse model outputs and biases instead of eliminating them, treating disagreements as strengths and hallucinations as hypotheses for clinician verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional approaches view bias in medical AI as a defect to eliminate, but human reasoning inherently incorporates valuable biases from education and experience. The authors argue that bias presence may be inevitable and potentially valuable in medical AI systems.

Method: Developed MEDLEY framework that orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather than collapsing into consensus. Created a proof-of-concept demonstrator using over 30 large language models that documents model-specific biases and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses.

Result: The demonstrator successfully preserved both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. It showed how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision.

Conclusion: MEDLEY reframes AI imperfection as a resource rather than a defect, offering a paradigm shift that opens new regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical AI systems under clinician supervision.

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

*Jiho Choi,Seojeong Park,Seongjong Song,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PosterForest is a training-free framework for automated scientific poster generation that uses hierarchical document structure and multi-agent collaboration to optimize content and layout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches neglect hierarchical document structure and semantic integration of textual/visual elements in scientific posters.

Method: Uses Poster Tree hierarchical representation and multi-agent collaboration strategy with content summarization and layout planning agents that provide mutual feedback.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in qualitative/quantitative evaluations, achieving quality closest to expert-designed posters with superior information preservation and user preference.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses hierarchical structure and visual-textual integration challenges in automated scientific poster generation.

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

*Fabrizio Fagiolo,Nicolo' Vescera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A variational quantum algorithm for TSP with compact permutation encoding and optimize-freeze-reuse strategy that reduces qubit requirements and eliminates costly structural research in testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a quantum algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem that reduces qubit requirements and enables rapid deployment on NISQ hardware by reusing optimized circuit structures.

Method: Combines compact permutation encoding with optimize-freeze-reuse strategy: first optimize circuit topology using Simulated Annealing on training instances, then freeze and reuse the structure while only re-optimizing parameters for new instances.

Result: Achieved 100% optimal trip sampling for 4 cities, 90% for 5 cities, 80% for 6 cities, but dropped to ~20% for 7 cities, showing scalability limitations for larger problems.

Conclusion: The method shows robust generalization for moderate problem sizes and dramatically reduces time-to-solution without degrading quality, but faces scalability challenges beyond 6-7 cities.

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

*Timothée Loranchet,Charles K. Assaad*

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical guarantees for orienting micro-level causal edges in time series using summary causal graphs from expert knowledge, even with macro-level cycles or bidirected edges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding causal relations in time series when full causal structure is unknown, by leveraging expert-provided summary causal graphs that capture main causal relations while abstracting micro-level details.

Method: The authors present conditions that guarantee orientability of micro-level edges between temporal variables given background knowledge encoded in a summary causal graph, assuming access to a faithful and causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph.

Result: The results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level, even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical guidance for leveraging summary causal graphs to inform causal discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series data.

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

### [24] [Tree-Guided Diffusion Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21800)
*Hyeonseong Jeon,Cheolhong Min,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP) is a zero-shot test-time planning framework that uses bi-level sampling with particle guidance for exploration and conditional denoising for exploitation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on diverse tasks without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient guidance for diffusion-based planning performs poorly in real-world scenarios with non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and multi-reward structures. Supervised approaches require task-specific training, limiting test-time flexibility and zero-shot generalization.

Method: TDP frames planning as tree search with bi-level sampling: (1) diverse parent trajectories via training-free particle guidance for exploration, (2) sub-trajectories refined through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives, using only pretrained models and test-time rewards.

Result: TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on three diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze multi-goal exploration.

Conclusion: TDP effectively addresses limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and leveraging gradient information across expanded solution space, enabling zero-shot test-time planning with superior performance across various domains.

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

*Thanasis Schoinas,Benjamin Guinard,Diba Esbati,Richard Chalk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining string similarity, topic modeling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based methods for clustering transaction counterparties in banking systems, outperforming traditional fuzzy matching and keyword approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language models are unsuitable for clustering transaction counterparties in banking systems like SWIFT, which lack sentence structure but contain manual entry variations and noise. Traditional fuzzy matching tools leave gaps in fraud investigation capabilities.

Method: Hybrid pipeline combining string similarity, topic modeling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based approaches that can handle unknown number of clusters. Includes custom metrics based on precision and recall for evaluation.

Result: Testing on real-life labeled dataset shows significantly improved performance over baseline rule-based (keyword) approach. The method maintains interpretability while reducing manual review needs and improving risk control in sanctions investigations.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach effectively addresses the limitations of natural language models for transaction counterparty clustering, providing better performance than traditional methods while retaining interpretability and reducing manual effort in financial investigations.

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reinforcement learning represents a fundamental shift from predictive AI to agentive clinical intelligence that actively makes intervention decisions with long-term goals in healthcare settings.

Method: The authors structure the RL landscape including model-based/model-free methods, offline/batch-constrained approaches, and emerging reward specification strategies. They analyze applications across critical care, chronic disease, mental health, diagnostics, and robotic assistance, while examining information fusion mechanisms and system architectures.

Result: The survey provides a comprehensive analysis of RL trends, gaps, and translational bottlenecks in healthcare, identifying how RL integrates multi-source signals through temporal and decision-level fusion mechanisms across various clinical architectures.

Conclusion: RL represents more than just tools - it's a paradigm shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical environments, requiring careful consideration of ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges for safe, human-aligned policy learning in healthcare AI.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

*Abdul Rehman,Ilona Heldal,Jerry Chun-Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified EEG emotion classification framework using LSTM-GRU achieves state-of-the-art performance (F1-score 0.932) on binary valence and multi-class emotion recognition tasks using the GAMEEMO dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing EEG emotion recognition studies that focus narrowly on binary valence or subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability for real-world affective computing systems.

Method: Uses GAMEEMO dataset with 14-channel EEG recordings from 28 subjects. Pipeline includes temporal window segmentation, hybrid statistical/frequency-domain feature extraction, z-score normalization. Evaluates Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, LSTM, LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM models across three classification axes: binary valence, multi-class emotion, and fine-grained multi-label representation.

Result: LSTM-GRU model consistently outperforms others, achieving F1-score of 0.932 in binary valence task, 94.5% in multi-class classification, and 90.6% in multi-label emotion classification.

Conclusion: The proposed unified multigranularity framework demonstrates superior performance in EEG-based emotion recognition, with LSTM-GRU emerging as the most effective architecture for handling complex emotion classification tasks across multiple granularity levels.

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PVPO is a critic-free RL method that uses advantage reference anchors and data pre-sampling to improve efficiency and avoid local optima, achieving SOTA performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing critic-free RL methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and intra-group comparisons, which can lead to local optima and high computational costs.

Method: Uses a reference model to rollout in advance and calculate reward scores as reference anchors, plus data pre-sampling to select high-gain samples based on difficulty assessment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nine datasets across two domains, with robust generalization across tasks and scalable performance across model scales.

Conclusion: PVPO effectively addresses cumulative bias from intra-group comparisons, reduces rollout dependency, and improves training efficiency through intelligent data selection.

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

*Tatyana Matveeva,Aleksandr Katrutsa,Evgeny Frolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGram is a full-matrix adaptive optimizer that uses symmetric factorization and low-rank approximations to enable efficient parameter correlation modeling while maintaining scalability for large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagonal adaptive methods like Adagrad cannot capture parameter correlations, while full-matrix methods are computationally prohibitive for large-scale optimization.

Method: Uses fast symmetric factorization for preconditioned updates and maintains low-rank preconditioner structure using matrix integrator methods to reduce memory and computational costs.

Result: AdaGram converges faster or matches diagonal adaptive optimizers with rank five and smaller approximations on standard machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: AdaGram provides a scalable solution for full-matrix adaptive optimization in large models by efficiently capturing parameter correlations with low computational overhead.

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

TL;DR: Machine learning system for detecting anomalies in NASA's Deep Space Network using predictive analysis, reinforcement learning for severity classification, and LLM explanations with human feedback integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DSN facilities degrade over time, causing costly disruptions to spacecraft communications. Need methods to pinpoint anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data to maintain operations for future space missions.

Method: Researched ML techniques for data reconstruction and anomaly detection using statistical computations. Integrated reinforcement learning subsystem for severity classification and LLM for anomaly explanations. Built full data pipeline system connecting extraction, parsing, and processing workflows with agentic AI system for complex reasoning.

Result: Developed complete data workflow for DSN anomaly detection with trained models from antenna data. Created coherent program for data extraction and processing where none existed before.

Conclusion: Successfully implemented an integrated AI system for DSN anomaly detection that can be improved over time through human feedback, enhancing maintenance and operations capabilities for future space missions.

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

*Pranoy Panda,Raghav Magazine,Chaitanya Devaguptapu,Sho Takemori,Vishal Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM routing as contextual bandit problem using PILOT algorithm with cost-aware policy for adaptive model selection without requiring complete inference across all LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised LLM routing approaches assume complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM pairings, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with evolving queries and incomplete mappings.

Method: Propose PILOT (Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive rouTing) that creates shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, initially learned from offline human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. Includes cost policy modeled as multi-choice knapsack problem for budget-aware routing.

Result: Developed adaptive routing framework that doesn't require exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries, enabling efficient resource utilization while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Contextual bandit formulation with PILOT provides practical solution for LLM routing that adapts to real-world constraints and evolving query patterns, offering cost-effective model selection without complete supervision.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

TL;DR: Gen-LRA is a novel membership inference attack that detects privacy leakage in synthetic data by exploiting generative model overfitting through likelihood ratio estimation, outperforming existing methods across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on heuristics and unreasonable assumptions, showing limited capability to detect privacy exposure through synthetic data release. The paper addresses the need for better tools to audit privacy leakage from generative models that tend to overfit to training data.

Method: Proposes Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a computationally efficient No-Box MIA that requires no model knowledge or access. It evaluates the influence of test observations on a surrogate model's estimation of local likelihood ratios over synthetic data.

Result: Gen-LRA consistently dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics in comprehensive benchmarks spanning diverse datasets, model architectures, and attack parameters.

Conclusion: Gen-LRA is an effective privacy auditing tool for synthetic data release, highlighting significant privacy risks posed by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Echo State Networks struggle with long-term information processing, limiting their effectiveness in time series tasks that require extended temporal dependencies.

Method: Proposed DeepResESNs with hierarchical untrained residual recurrent layers using different orthogonal configurations for temporal residual connections, including randomly generated and fixed-structure setups.

Result: The approach significantly boosts memory capacity and long-term temporal modeling, outperforming traditional shallow and deep Reservoir Computing methods across various time series tasks.

Conclusion: DeepResESNs provide a mathematically grounded framework with stable dynamics that effectively addresses the long-term processing limitations of traditional ESNs through residual connections.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

TL;DR: FUTURE is a novel gradient-based unlearning algorithm for tree ensembles that addresses limitations of existing methods by using probabilistic model approximations to handle non-differentiability, enabling effective and efficient forgetting of sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for tree ensembles are often model-specific or rely on discrete tree structures, making them difficult to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets, especially with growing data privacy concerns and right to be forgotten requirements.

Method: Formulates unlearning as a gradient-based optimization task and adopts probabilistic model approximations to handle the non-differentiability of tree ensembles, enabling end-to-end unlearning.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful unlearning performance.

Conclusion: FUTURE provides an effective and efficient solution for unlearning in tree ensembles, addressing the limitations of previous approaches through gradient-based optimization with probabilistic approximations.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

*Christopher R. Lee-Jenkins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a variational framework for understanding next-token generation in LLMs as constrained optimization on the probability simplex, showing how temperature scaling and sampling methods relate to this mathematical structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the intuitive understanding of token generation in LLMs through a rigorous mathematical framework that explains temperature scaling, sampling methods, and distribution trajectories.

Method: Models next-token generation as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex using multiplicative-weights updates and replicator flow analysis in continuous time.

Result: Proves that next-token distributions follow smooth trajectories converging to softmax equilibrium, with temperature acting as exact time rescaling and sampling methods restricting flow to simplex faces.

Conclusion: Provides a formal mathematical foundation for output distribution dynamics in LLMs, explaining common practices like temperature scaling and sampling while offering insights into path-dependent behaviors like hallucinations.

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Counterintuitive RL phenomena in LLMs only work when models already have strong task alignment; standard RL methods remain robust across all settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent RL advances in LLMs show surprising phenomena like single-example learning and negative-only training matching full datasets, but it's unclear when these actually work versus when they fail.

Method: Systematic examination of counterintuitive claims through rigorous experiments across different model architectures and task domains, measuring model-task alignment via pass@k accuracy.

Result: Counterintuitive results only occur when models already exhibit strong model-task alignment; these techniques fail in challenging regimes where standard RL methods remain effective.

Conclusion: Model-task alignment is the key factor determining when counterintuitive RL phenomena work; standard RL training maintains consistent robustness across different alignment conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel generative continual learning framework using self-organizing maps and VAEs that enables memory-efficient replay without storing raw data or task labels, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the memory inefficiency in continual learning by eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task labels while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: Combines self-organizing maps (SOMs) with variational autoencoders (VAEs) - SOM operates in latent space for high-dimensional inputs (CIFAR) and standalone for low-dimensional inputs (MNIST). Stores running statistics (mean, variance, covariance) for each SOM unit to generate synthetic samples for replay.

Result: Outperforms memory-free methods and achieves nearly 10% improvement on CIFAR-10 and 7% on CIFAR-100 compared to best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance. Competitive with memory-based methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual learning that also enables visualization and can serve as a generative model post-training.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning Mixture of Experts framework that combines three state-of-the-art CFD surrogate models (DoMINO, X-MeshGraphNet, FigConvNet) using a gating network to achieve superior aerodynamic prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost of CFD simulations is a bottleneck in automotive design, and while ML-based surrogates exist, no single architecture demonstrates universal superiority across all scenarios.

Method: Proposes a Mixture of Experts model with a gating network that dynamically combines predictions from three heterogeneous neural networks, using entropy regularization to prevent model collapse and ensure balanced contributions.

Result: Achieves significant reduction in L-2 prediction error, outperforming both ensemble averages and the most accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities (surface pressure and wall shear stress fields).

Conclusion: The MoE framework provides a powerful strategy for creating robust composite surrogate models by synergistically combining complementary strengths of specialized architectures in automotive aerodynamics.

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

*Farnoush Rezaei Jafari,Oliver Eberle,Ashkan Khakzar,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relevance Patching (RelP) is a new gradient-based method that improves upon attribution patching by using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation coefficients, offering better faithfulness to activation patching while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activation patching is computationally expensive at scale, while attribution patching suffers from noise and reduced reliability in deep non-linear networks. There's a need for a more faithful and efficient method.

Method: Replaces local gradients in attribution patching with propagation coefficients from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), maintaining computational efficiency (2 forward + 1 backward pass) while improving faithfulness through relevance conservation and better signal-to-noise ratio.

Result: RelP significantly outperforms standard attribution patching, achieving Pearson correlation of 0.956 vs 0.006 for MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large on IOI task. It achieves comparable faithfulness to Integrated Gradients without the extra computational cost.

Conclusion: Relevance Patching provides a more accurate and computationally efficient alternative to existing methods for localizing model components responsible for specific behaviors, particularly effective for analyzing residual stream and MLP outputs.

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOwen is an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley values for client contribution estimation in federated learning, achieving better accuracy with adaptive client selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate estimation of client contributions in federated learning is essential for fair rewards and faster convergence, but exact Shapley value computation is computationally infeasible for large federations.

Method: Uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley values efficiently under fixed evaluation budget, combined with adaptive client selection strategy that balances exploitation of high-value clients and exploration of under-sampled ones.

Result: Achieves up to 23% higher final accuracy within same communication rounds compared to state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks under fixed valuation cost.

Conclusion: FedOwen provides an efficient and effective solution for client contribution estimation in federated learning, enabling better model convergence while maintaining computational feasibility.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G&L v1.0 introduces a framework to measure cold-start adaptability by tracking cumulative errors during sequential learning, revealing that smaller models adapt faster with fewer initial mistakes while current models remain far from optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML evaluation focuses on final accuracy but overlooks the cumulative cost of adaptation - the mistakes made while learning from scratch. This gap in measuring early-phase learning efficiency motivated the development of G&L.

Method: G&L measures cold-start adaptability through sequential labeling of unlabeled datasets. The learner selects instances, predicts labels, receives ground truth, and updates parameters in online or batch modes. Four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained × Online/Batch) disentangle initialization and update frequency effects.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and AG News show systematic differences: smaller models adapt with fewer initial errors, pretraining benefits vary by domain, and current models remain well above the oracle reference band, highlighting a significant adaptability gap.

Conclusion: G&L provides a reproducible framework that complements conventional benchmarks by quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, enabling development of models that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the first examples.

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

### [43] [CALM: A Framework for Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21273)
*Ashok Devireddy,Shunping Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALM is a real-time anomaly detection framework that uses continuous fine-tuning and LLM-based anomaly judgment to adapt to concept drift in non-stationary time-series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline-trained anomaly detection models suffer performance degradation when faced with concept drift in streaming time-series data, where statistical properties change over time.

Method: Built on Apache Beam, CALM uses TimesFm foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection with two innovations: continuous fine-tuning mechanism for real-time adaptation, and LLM-as-a-Judge component for semantic anomaly evaluation and high-quality dataset curation.

Result: Evaluation on TSB-UAD benchmark shows continuously fine-tuned model improves ROC AUC scores in most datasets compared to static pre-trained base model.

Conclusion: The adaptive, LLM-guided approach effectively maintains high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments by addressing concept drift through real-time model adaptation and intelligent anomaly curation.

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates domain shift detection in EMG signals using data stream learning techniques, revealing limitations of current drift detection methods for real-time EMG applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting domain shifts in EMG signals is challenging due to their inherent non-stationarity, which affects the stability of EMG decoding models in real-world scenarios.

Method: Used DB6 dataset from Ninapro database, defined domains as time-series segments from different subjects/sessions, applied KPCA with cosine kernel for preprocessing, and evaluated multiple drift detection methods (CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, ADWIN).

Result: Current drift detection techniques show limitations in achieving high performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals.

Conclusion: Streaming-based approaches show potential for maintaining stable EMG decoding models, but further research is needed to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical applications.

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

### [45] [MyGO: Memory Yielding Generative Offline-consolidation for Lifelong Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21296)
*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MyGO is a lifelong learning framework inspired by biological wake-sleep cycles that uses generative models instead of storing raw data to prevent catastrophic forgetting while maintaining privacy and storage efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in continual learning including data privacy concerns, storage limitations, and performance degradation with dissimilar tasks, moving beyond traditional experience replay and complex regularization methods.

Method: Two-phase approach: 'wake' phase learns new tasks and trains compact generative models (G-mem) to capture data distributions; 'sleep' phase uses all G-mem models to generate pseudo-data for knowledge distillation into a core feature extractor without storing raw data.

Result: MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains high average accuracy across tasks on both computer vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News) benchmarks compared to sequential fine-tuning baselines.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness and domain-generality by successfully preventing catastrophic forgetting while offering privacy and storage advantages through compact generative models instead of raw data storage.

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

### [46] [Improving Fisher Information Estimation and Efficiency for LoRA-based LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21300)
*Yejin Kim,Eunwon Kim,Buru Chang,Junsuk Choe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VILA is a novel machine unlearning framework that improves upon FILA by better accounting for Fisher information assumptions and enabling parameter identification without full model access, achieving 100x parameter efficiency and 40x faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often unintentionally generate sensitive information, and retraining models to remove this data is computationally expensive. Existing unlearning methods like FILA have limitations in parameter importance estimation and require full model access.

Method: VILA explicitly considers the fundamental assumptions underlying Fisher information that were overlooked in FILA, enhancing accuracy of parameter identification for forget sets. It enables parameter identification without accessing the entire model, reducing computational costs.

Result: VILA achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed compared to FILA. It sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE.

Conclusion: VILA provides an effective and efficient solution for machine unlearning that addresses limitations of previous methods, offering significant improvements in computational efficiency and performance while better handling sensitive information removal from LLMs.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at

### [47] [Convergence of regularized agent-state-based Q-learning in POMDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21314)
*Amit Sinha,Matthieu Geist,Aditya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical framework for analyzing convergence of regularized Q-learning algorithms with agent states, showing convergence to fixed points of regularized MDPs under mild conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the convergence properties of practical Q-learning algorithms that use agent states (like RNN states) and policy regularization, which are common in practice but lack theoretical analysis.

Method: Analyzes regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) framework, investigates simplest form of such algorithms, and provides theoretical convergence proofs under mild technical conditions.

Result: Shows that RASQL converges to the fixed point of an appropriately defined regularized MDP that depends on the behavioral policy's stationary distribution. Also extends analysis to periodic policy variants.

Conclusion: The empirical convergence behavior matches the theoretical limits, providing a solid theoretical foundation for understanding practical Q-learning algorithms with agent states and regularization.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

### [48] [Distribution-Aware Feature Selection for SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21324)
*Narmeen Oozeer,Nirmalendu Prakash,Michael Lan,Alice Rigg,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE improves sparse autoencoders by scoring features across token batches and sampling from a candidate pool, balancing global consistency with fine-grained reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TopK SAE is inefficient as it treats all tokens equally despite varying information content. BatchTopK improves average reconstruction but suffers from 'activation lottery' where rare high-magnitude features dominate over more informative lower-magnitude ones.

Method: Score feature columns of batch activation matrix using L2 norm or entropy to form candidate pool of size Kl, then apply Top-K selection from this restricted pool. Varying l parameter controls spectrum between batch-level and token-specific feature selection.

Result: On Pythia-160M, no single l value optimizes all metrics - best choice depends on trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE provides tunable distribution-aware approach.

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE reframes BatchTopK as a tunable family that allows balancing global consistency (small l) with fine-grained reconstruction (large l), providing flexibility based on specific application requirements.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

*Xuan Hou,Shuhan Liu,Zhaohui Peng,Yaohui Chu,Yue Zhang,Yining Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stage-Diff is a staged diffusion model for long-term time series generation that addresses complex temporal dependencies and data distribution shifts through stage-wise generation and progressive decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term time series present challenges with complex long-range temporal dependencies, gradual data distribution shifts, and intricate inter-feature relationships that existing generative models struggle to handle effectively.

Method: A staged diffusion model with stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, using progressive sequence decomposition for channel-independent modeling at different time scales combined with multi-channel fusion modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in handling long-term time series generation tasks.

Conclusion: Stage-Diff successfully balances long-term dependencies with data distribution shifts and effectively captures both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies through its staged generation approach.

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

*Xuan Hou,Shuhan Liu,Zhaohui Peng,Yaohui Chu,Yue Zhang,Yining Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DLGAN is a dual-layer GAN model that decomposes time series generation into feature extraction and reconstruction stages to better preserve temporal dependencies and capture original sequence features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series synthesis methods struggle to ensure temporal dependencies in generated sequences and fail to accurately capture feature information from original time series when modeling directly on random sequences.

Method: A two-stage approach: 1) sequence feature extraction and reconstruction forming a complete autoencoder for supervised learning, and 2) GAN to generate synthetic feature vectors aligned with real sequence features.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the model's superiority across various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: DLGAN effectively addresses temporal dependency preservation and feature capture challenges in time series synthesis through its dual-layer architecture.

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

### [51] [Adaptive Heavy-Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21353)
*Bodu Gong,Gustavo Enrique Batista,Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AHTSGD is a novel optimization algorithm that adaptively injects heavy-tailed noise during early training to enhance exploration and transitions to lighter-tailed noise as sharpness stabilizes, improving generalization and convergence to wide basins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address poor generalization in large neural networks by leveraging insights about wide basins promoting stability and empirical observations of heavy-tailed gradient noise and Edge of Stability phenomenon during training.

Method: Adaptive Heavy Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD) that dynamically adjusts the tail heaviness of injected noise based on the sharpness of the loss landscape, starting with heavier tails for exploration and transitioning to lighter tails as training stabilizes.

Result: AHTSGD consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and shows marked improvements on noisy datasets like SVHN. It accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves generalization across both clean and noisy settings.

Conclusion: AHTSGD effectively promotes convergence to wide basins by adapting noise injection to training dynamics, resulting in better generalization, faster convergence from poor initializations, and robustness to learning rate choices.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether neural networks build representations through smooth refinement or more complex computational processes, specifically examining chess AI policy networks compared to language models.

Method: Extended the logit lens technique to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, examining playing strength, puzzle-solving ability, move rankings, and policy divergence across network layers.

Result: Found strong monotonic trends in playing strength and puzzle-solving ability across layers, but policy distributions showed non-smooth trajectories with correct solutions discovered early then discarded, poor move ranking correlation with final outputs, and high policy divergence until late layers.

Conclusion: Chess policy networks exhibit fundamentally different representation building compared to language models, with non-smooth computational processes rather than the smooth distributional convergence typically seen in language models.

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a general and flexible mixture modeling framework that can handle both parametric and nonparametric components from different distribution families while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Method: Partitions data into subsets and fits separate density estimators to each partition. The framework is modular and can incorporate various estimator types. MV-PMODE specifically scales this approach to high-dimensional settings.

Result: Achieves near-optimal rates for the estimator class, remains valid with mixture components from different families, and MV-PMODE performs competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection in thousands of dimensions.

Conclusion: PMODE provides a theoretically sound and practical framework for mixture modeling that is both general and scalable, with competitive performance in high-dimensional applications like anomaly detection.

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

*Felix Simon Reimers,Carl-Hendrik Peters,Stefano Nichele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A low-cost method using mobile network data and reservoir computing to monitor network states through proxy task performance analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a non-invasive, cost-effective approach for monitoring communication and mobility networks using readily available data.

Method: Transforms mobile network utilization data into reservoir computing models (echo state networks), uses neuroscience-inspired proxy tasks to measure performance, and analyzes how performance relates to network state and perturbations.

Result: Demonstrated that proxy task performance correlates with network state and visibly decreases when networks are perturbed, showing the method's sensitivity to network conditions.

Conclusion: This proof-of-concept approach shows promise for near-real-time monitoring and identifying weak spots in both mobile communication and transportation networks using inexpensive, readily available data.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

TL;DR: CoM is a layer-wise merging method that addresses internal covariate shift in model merging by updating activation statistics auto-regressively, achieving state-of-the-art performance without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging techniques treat layers independently, failing to account for inter-layer dependencies and causing distributional mismatches similar to internal covariate shift.

Method: Chain of Merges (CoM) - a layer-wise merging procedure that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion to explicitly handle cross-layer interactions through conditionally optimal updates.

Result: CoM effectively mitigates degradation caused by covariate shift and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoM provides a coherent merging approach that properly accounts for inter-layer dependencies, solving the critical challenge of merging specialized models without retraining while handling internal covariate shift issues.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel GAN-based framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing, showing improved performance with hybrid quantum/classical approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous biomanufacturing requires robust early anomaly detection since minor deviations can compromise yield, stability, and economic performance due to complex non-linear dynamics.

Method: Ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for unsupervised anomaly detection, tested on benchmark dataset simulating normal/anomalous operations, with evaluation of hybrid quantum/classical GAN approach using both simulated and real quantum processors.

Result: The hybrid quantum/classical approach yields improved anomaly detection rates compared to classical methods.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum/classical approaches show potential for solving real-world problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes through enhanced anomaly detection capabilities.

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real

### [57] [Beyond expected value: geometric mean optimization for long-term policy performance in reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21443)
*Xinyi Sheng,Dominik Baumann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes novel RL algorithm combining ensemble average with time-average growth rate to optimize long-term individual trajectory performance using modified geometric mean with sliding window as regularizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL optimizes expected cumulative reward (ensemble average), but real-world deployment requires good performance on individual trajectories, not just average performance.

Method: Defines Bellman operator for time-average growth rate, uses geometric mean under multiplicative reward dynamics, and proposes modified geometric mean with N-sliding window estimator for general reward dynamics as regularizer in objective.

Result: Algorithm outperforms conventional RL methods in challenging simulations by enabling policies to benefit from both ensemble average and time-average simultaneously.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the need for optimizing long-term individual trajectory performance while maintaining benefits of ensemble optimization, demonstrating superior performance over traditional RL methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

### [58] [Normalized Maximum Likelihood Code-Length on Riemannian Manifold Data Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21466)
*Kota Fukuzawa,Atsushi Suzuki,Kenji Yamanishi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Riemannian manifold NML (Rm-NML) - a coordinate-invariant extension of Normalized Maximum Likelihood to Riemannian manifolds, with computational methods for symmetric spaces like hyperbolic spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NML formulations are Euclidean-based and coordinate-dependent, making them unsuitable for Riemannian manifolds like hyperbolic spaces that better represent hierarchical graph data.

Method: Defines Rm-NML that reflects Riemannian geometric structure, extends computational techniques to manifolds, and derives simplification methods for symmetric spaces including hyperbolic spaces.

Result: Developed Rm-NML that is coordinate transformation invariant and coincides with conventional NML in Euclidean space. Explicitly computed Rm-NML for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Conclusion: Successfully extended NML to Riemannian manifolds with geometric invariance, providing practical computational methods particularly for symmetric spaces like hyperbolic spaces used in graph data analysis.

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

TL;DR: CByG framework extends Bayesian Flow Network for conditional molecular generation with property-specific guidance, outperforming baselines in binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SBDD models focus only on binding affinity but neglect critical drug discovery properties like synthetic feasibility and selectivity, creating a gap between academic research and practical applications.

Method: Extends Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based conditional generative model that integrates property-specific guidance for molecular generation.

Result: Significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation criteria including binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity.

Conclusion: CByG provides an effective and practical framework for real-world drug discovery by addressing the limitations of conventional diffusion-based models and offering comprehensive property guidance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

*Pascal R. van der Vaart,Neil Yorke-Smith,Matthijs T. J. Spaan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian deep Q-learning shows a cold posterior effect where performance improves with lower posterior temperature, contrary to theory. Common Gaussian likelihood assumptions are violated, and better priors can improve Bayesian RL algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning improves exploration and robustness, but current Bayesian approaches focus on posterior approximation accuracy rather than examining the accuracy of prior and likelihood assumptions.

Method: Empirical study of prior distributions and statistical tests to challenge common Gaussian likelihood assumptions in Bayesian model-free algorithms. Development and testing of simple, implementable solutions for better priors in deep Q-learning.

Result: Demonstrated cold posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning where performance increases with reduced posterior temperature. Found that Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated through statistical tests.

Conclusion: Developing more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian reinforcement learning research, as improved priors lead to more performant Bayesian algorithms.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

### [61] [Failure Prediction Is a Better Performance Proxy for Early-Exit Networks Than Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21495)
*Piotr Kubaty,Filip Szatkowski,Metod Jazbec,Bartosz Wójcik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Early-exit models use confidence-based exit strategies, but calibration measures can be misleading indicators of performance. The paper shows miscalibrated networks can outperform calibrated ones and proposes failure prediction as a better proxy for early-exit model evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of confidence-based exit strategies in early-exit models, where calibration measures can be misleading and don't preserve sample ranking, leading to inefficient computation.

Method: The authors demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated networks outperform calibrated ones, and propose using failure prediction instead of calibration as it accounts for sample ranking changes and correlates better with efficiency improvements.

Result: The study shows that well-calibrated classifiers may still waste computation, common calibration methods don't preserve sample ranking, and failure prediction demonstrates strong correlation with efficiency improvements in early-exit models.

Conclusion: Failure prediction is a more useful and dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models compared to calibration measures, as it better accounts for efficiency improvements and sample ranking.

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

*Vishal Pandey,Debasmita Biswas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SNN-DT combines spiking neural networks with Decision Transformers for ultra-low-power reinforcement learning, achieving comparable performance with 10,000x energy reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based RL agents consume too much energy for edge devices, while spiking neural networks offer ultra-low-power inference but haven't been integrated with return-conditioned sequence modeling.

Method: Embeds Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons into self-attention blocks, trains end-to-end with surrogate gradients, adds three-factor plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and lightweight dendritic routing.

Result: Matches/exceeds standard Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks while emitting fewer than 10 spikes per decision, suggesting 4 orders-of-magnitude energy reduction.

Conclusion: SNN-DT successfully merges sequence modeling with neuromorphic efficiency, enabling real-time low-power control on embedded and wearable devices.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

*Israel Abebe Azime,Deborah D. Kanubala,Tejumade Afonja,Mario Fritz,Isabel Valera,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with tabular data fairness in loan approvals. Serialization format choice significantly impacts both performance and fairness, with some formats improving F1 scores but worsening fairness disparities. ICL boosts performance but has inconsistent fairness effects across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes financial decision-making like loan approvals, there's a critical need to assess their performance and fairness when processing tabular data from different geographical regions.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from Ghana, Germany, and US, focusing on zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities with different serialization formats (GReat, LIFT, etc.).

Result: Serialization format significantly affects both performance and fairness - certain formats yield higher F1 scores but exacerbate fairness disparities. ICL improved performance by 4.9-59.6% over zero-shot, but fairness effects varied across datasets.

Conclusion: Effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware models are crucial for improving LLM reliability in financial decision-making applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

### [64] [On the Hardness of Learning GNN-based SAT Solvers: The Role of Graph Ricci Curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21513)
*Geri Skenderi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNN-based SAT solvers suffer performance degradation on harder instances due to negative graph curvature in SAT formula graphs, which causes oversquashing and limits long-range dependency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) perform poorly on harder Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) and provide a geometric explanation through graph curvature analysis.

Method: Analyze bipartite graphs from random k-SAT formulas using graph Ricci Curvature to quantify local connectivity bottlenecks and demonstrate oversquashing effects in GNNs.

Result: Random k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, with curvature decreasing as instance difficulty increases. Curvature serves as a strong indicator of problem complexity and can predict GNN solver performance.

Conclusion: Negative graph curvature explains GNN limitations in SAT solving due to oversquashing, providing insights for future solver design and connecting to existing solver principles.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study shows data minimization for recommender systems is technically feasible but practically challenging due to dependence on technical settings and user characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to be limited to what's necessary, but operationalizing this for recommender systems that rely on extensive personal data remains a significant challenge.

Method: Proposed a novel problem formulation, analyzed various minimization techniques, and investigated key factors influencing their effectiveness for minimizing implicit feedback inference data in recommender systems.

Result: Substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without significant performance loss, but practicality depends on technical settings (performance targets, model choice) and user characteristics (history size, preference complexity).

Conclusion: While technical feasibility is established, data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on technical and user context makes a universal standard for data 'necessity' difficult to implement.

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative

enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

Conclusion: PINNs represent a paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation that bridges data-driven flexibility with first-principles rigor, advancing real-time grid control and scalable digital twins for mission-critical energy systems.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory

(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ocean salinity measurement is sparse, irregular, and noisy in drifter datasets. Traditional methods rely on linearity and stationarity assumptions, while ML models struggle with severe sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates.

Method: OASIS (OceAn Salinity Imputation System) - a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address salinity imputation challenges with sparse data.

Result: Not specified in the provided abstract content.

Conclusion: The paper introduces OASIS as a solution to overcome limitations of traditional approaches and standard machine learning methods for ocean salinity measurement and imputation.

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine
ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy,
especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote

limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While
machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe
sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates without
specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation
System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address
these challenges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes linear convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent/flow in training over-parameterized two-layer physics informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations, extending previous results from deterministic gradient descent to stochastic optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs are popular neural solvers for PDEs, typically trained using stochastic gradient descent methods. While previous work analyzed convergence for gradient descent, there was a need to establish convergence guarantees for stochastic optimization methods which introduce dynamic randomness during training.

Method: The authors analyze stochastic gradient descent/flow for training over-parameterized two-layer PINNs. The key methodological challenge involves handling the dynamic randomness from stochastic optimization while ensuring positive definiteness of suitable Gram matrices throughout the training process.

Result: The paper establishes linear convergence of stochastic gradient descent/flow in training over-parameterized two-layer PINNs for a general class of activation functions, with results holding with high probability.

Conclusion: This work provides theoretical guarantees for stochastic optimization methods in training PINNs, extending previous deterministic results and offering insights into the optimization dynamics of neural networks trained by stochastic algorithms.

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision theory algorithms are valuable for data-efficient scientific discovery but their theoretical analyses are often inaccessible to non-experts, creating a need for more approachable educational materials.

Method: The monograph offers a self-contained introduction to theoretical analysis of probabilistic decision-making algorithms, assuming only basic probability/statistics knowledge and elementary Gaussian process understanding.

Result: Not applicable - this is an introductory monograph rather than a research paper presenting new results.

Conclusion: The work aims to bridge the accessibility gap in decision theory analysis, providing foundational understanding that can help develop next-generation algorithms for scientific discovery applications.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

### [73] [Predicting Social Media Engagement from Emotional and Temporal Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21650)
*Yunwoo Kim,Junhyuk Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning model predicts social media engagement (likes/comments) from emotional and temporal features, achieving excellent prediction for likes but poor performance for comments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict social media engagement metrics (comments and likes) using emotional and temporal features from song data, understanding what drives different types of engagement.

Method: Multi-target regression using HistGradientBoostingRegressor on 600 songs with valence, arousal, sentiment metrics, and log-transformed engagement ratios to handle skewed targets.

Result: Model achieves R^2 = 0.98 for likes prediction but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments, showing emotional/temporal features effectively predict likes but not comments.

Conclusion: Likes are driven by affective and exposure signals captured by emotional/temporal features, while comments depend on additional unrepresented factors requiring different feature sets.

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLAC developed SNL framework for real-time ML inference on FPGAs to handle 1 TB/s data from LCLS-II FEL, with Auto-SNL tool that outperforms hls4ml in latency and resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser generates X-ray pulses at 1 MHz rates with data throughput exceeding 1 TB/s, requiring real-time ML data reduction but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency for high-speed experiments.

Method: Developed SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL) for FPGA deployment with dynamic weight updates, and Auto-SNL Python extension to convert neural network models into SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code.

Result: Benchmark comparison against hls4ml showed SNL achieves competitive or superior latency in most architectures and offers FPGA resource savings in some cases.

Conclusion: SNL demonstrates versatility for real-time ML inference, enabling new opportunities in high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and other fields requiring high-speed data processing.

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

### [75] [Activation Subspaces for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21695)
*Barış Zöngür,Robin Hesse,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActSub: A novel OOD detection method using SVD to decompose classifier activations into decisive and insignificant components, achieving state-of-the-art performance by leveraging different subspaces for Far-OOD and Near-OOD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reliability of deep models in real-world applications by developing a more effective method for distinguishing in-distribution (ID) from out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, particularly addressing challenges in both large (Far-OOD) and small (Near-OOD) distribution shifts.

Method: Utilizes singular value decomposition (SVD) of the weight matrix from the classification head to decompose model activations into decisive components (maximally contributing to classifier output) and insignificant components (minimally contributing). The method combines both subspaces: insignificant subspace for Far-OOD detection and decisive subspace for Near-OOD detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in various standard OOD benchmarks. The insignificant subspace proves more effective for Far-OOD detection as it remains unaffected by classification objectives, while the decisive subspace works better for Near-OOD scenarios by avoiding interference from insignificant components.

Conclusion: ActSub provides an effective unified approach for OOD detection by strategically leveraging different activation subspaces based on the nature of distribution shifts, demonstrating superior performance across both Far-OOD and Near-OOD regimes.

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

*Xiaoyang Wang,Christopher C. Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE-Health is a Mixture of Experts framework for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare that dynamically handles samples with varying/incomplete modalities through expert networks and gating mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world healthcare data often has varied/incomplete modalities across patients and institutions, but existing approaches require complete data or manual selection, limiting clinical applicability.

Method: Proposes MoE-Health framework with specialized expert networks and dynamic gating mechanism that automatically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data modalities.

Result: Achieves superior performance on MIMIC-IV dataset for in-hospital mortality, long length of stay, and readmission prediction compared to existing multimodal fusion methods, with robustness across modality availability patterns.

Conclusion: MoE-Health effectively integrates multimodal healthcare data, offers improved predictive performance and robustness for heterogeneous/incomplete data, making it suitable for diverse healthcare environments.

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adapting Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity Design (LRDD) into a statistical learning framework to forecast mental health discontinuities and slope changes from local events, showing significant improvement over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital for public health policy, but traditional forecasting alone offers limited insights into causal impacts of events on community well-being.

Method: Proposed adapting LRDDs into a statistical learning framework that estimates future discontinuities and slope changes using location's score history, dynamic covariates, and exogenous variables. Applied to predict anxiety discontinuities in US counties from COVID-19 events.

Result: The task was difficult but more achievable with sophisticated models. Best results came from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates, showing strong improvement (r=+.46 for discontinuity and r=+.65 for slope) over traditional static community representations.

Conclusion: Discontinuity forecasting enables estimating idiosyncratic effects of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities, opening new possibilities for public health policy.

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

### [78] [UniMLR: Modeling Implicit Class Significance for Multi-Label Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21772)
*V. Bugra Yesilkaynak,Emine Dari,Alican Mertan,Gozde Unal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniMLR introduces a novel multi-label ranking approach that leverages ranking among positive labels rather than treating them equally, unifying ranking and classification tasks while addressing dataset scarcity through synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLR frameworks only use binary label partitioning and ignore ranking information among positive labels, missing valuable relevance signals and suffering from dataset scarcity and annotation bias.

Method: Proposes UniMLR paradigm that models implicit class relevance as probability distributions using positive label rankings. Introduces eight synthetic Ranked MNIST datasets with varying significance factors to address dataset limitations.

Result: Statistical demonstration that the method accurately learns positive rank order consistent with ground truth and proportional to underlying significance values. Comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the framework.

Conclusion: UniMLR successfully unifies ranking and classification in MLR by exploiting positive label ranking information, providing a more effective approach that addresses dataset scarcity through synthetic data generation and demonstrates accurate learning of label significance.

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

TL;DR: Proposed framework for heart rate prediction that handles data heterogeneity from different devices and users through feature dropout and contrastive learning, achieving 17-15% performance improvements on new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data heterogeneity challenges in real-world heart rate monitoring - source heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and user heterogeneity from distinct physiological patterns across individuals and activities.

Method: Framework with random feature dropout strategy for source heterogeneity, time-aware attention module for long-term physiological traits, and contrastive learning objective for discriminative representation space. Created new ParroTao benchmark dataset.

Result: Outperformed existing baselines by 17% on ParroTao dataset and 15% on FitRec dataset. Learned representations showed strong discriminative power and practical value in downstream applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles both source and user heterogeneity in heart rate prediction, demonstrating significant performance improvements and practical applicability for real-world health monitoring.

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

*Jessica Liang,Anirudh Bharadwaj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QR-LoRA: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that uses QR decomposition to create an orthonormal basis from pretrained weights, then trains only scalar coefficients for LoRA updates, achieving comparable performance with dramatically fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA and its SVD variants require learning both update matrices directly, which can be computationally expensive and lack interpretability. There's a need for more efficient and structured adaptation methods for large language models.

Method: Extract orthonormal basis from pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, then express LoRA update as linear combination of these basis vectors while training only the scalar coefficients.

Result: QR-LoRA matches or exceeds performance of full fine-tuning, standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA on GLUE tasks with only 601 parameters - 1000x reduction vs full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA.

Conclusion: QR-LoRA provides an extremely parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach that maintains performance while imposing clear structure on adaptation and drastically reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

TL;DR: FLIP is a transformer-based VAE with latent diffusion that generates fair and private tabular data without requiring predefined downstream tasks, using Rényi differential privacy and latent space alignment techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, AI Act) and fairness concerns in sensitive domains like healthcare by enabling risk-aware data sharing through synthetic data generation that preserves both privacy and fairness.

Method: Transformer-based variational autoencoder with latent diffusion, Rényi differential privacy constraints during training, RDP-compatible balanced sampling for input space fairness, and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) for latent space fairness by aligning neuron activations across protected groups.

Result: FLIP effectively provides significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse downstream tasks while maintaining differential privacy constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed FLIP framework successfully addresses both privacy and fairness concerns in synthetic tabular data generation, offering broader applicability without reliance on fixed downstream tasks, making it suitable for sensitive domains under regulatory constraints.

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.
