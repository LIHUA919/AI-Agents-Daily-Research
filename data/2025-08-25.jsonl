However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model\nsizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and\nenergy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has\nemerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency\nwithout the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing\npruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require\ncomputationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a\nnovel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained\nLLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages\nboth weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate\nredundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,\nand easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM\narchitectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of\nstandard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner\nsurpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight\nupdates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the\nhighest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the\ncorresponding codes publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/sazzadadib/Z-Pruner."}

Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.\nFirstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a\nCross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically\nquery and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams\nwithin the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,\ncontext-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive\nGated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the\noriginal linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,\nensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from\noverwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via\nLoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly\nreduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for\nresource-limited scenarios.

We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically,\nby starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the\nLLMs' system prompt.

With the astounding\nadvances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been\ndeveloped to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the\npotential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently\nconstrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs\ntypically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input\nlayer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in\ndeeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual\nembeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer\nSteerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to\ndirectly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the\nprogressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF\nleverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically\nrich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across\nLLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are\ndesigned to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual\nmodalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures\nefficient few-shot learning capabilities.

As a crucial\ntechnique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate\nmodified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant\nperformance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these\nchallenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV\ncache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high\nsimilarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,\nresulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer\nto RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems."}

However, residents are often given limited\ninformation about when their service requests will be addressed, which can\nreduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of\nfollow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests\nis challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal\ncorrelations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request\ntypes, and high variation in service duration even within the same request\ncategory. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view\nSpatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned\nchallenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.\nIn detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among\nheterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to\nmodel service time variation within homogeneous types.
