These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by\nwhich an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and\nstep-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in\nrecording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present\nSimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding\ndialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,\nSimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching\nchallenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn\nfeedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the\ncreation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real\nnovice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as\nextroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.\nCompared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate\ncomparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the\nprocess as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own\nprofessional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model\nusing the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional\nquality.

To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which\nemphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp\nconsists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting\ngraph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend\nonly on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the\ngraph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract\nstructural information and provide discriminative graph representations\ncomparable across diverse domains.

Object detection is an extension of classification that includes\nlocalization of the object via a bounding box within the sample.\nClassification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by\ncounting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the\nground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as\nequivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy\nwith a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or\noperator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure\nexists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a\ngiven prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground\ntruth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions\ninstead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of\nmisclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in\ncomplexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class\nlabels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The\nscoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees\nthat represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors\ndiscouraged.

Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on\ndesigning communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information\nfrom other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such\napproaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting\ntransmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume\nof traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,\nmaking the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for\nfederated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).\nUnlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client\ncommunication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate\npredictions using only local information.

To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which\nemphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp\nconsists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting\ngraph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend\nonly on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the\ngraph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract\nstructural information and provide discriminative graph representations\ncomparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the\nrepresentations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a\ncomprehensive GFM.

A major challenge is the integration of real-world data\ninto the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we\nintroduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic\ndisplacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in\nfunction to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a\ncustom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to\ncounteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes.
