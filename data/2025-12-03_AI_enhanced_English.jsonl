Building an effective algorithmic trading system may require a professional team to develop and test over the years. In this paper, we propose an orchestration framework for financial agents, which aims to democratize financial intelligence to the general public. We map each component of the traditional algorithmic trading system to agents, including planner, orchestrator, alpha agents, risk agents, portfolio agents, backtest agents, execution agents, audit agents, and memory agent. We present two in-house trading examples. For the stock trading task (hourly data from 04/2024 to 12/2024), our approach achieved a return of $20.42\\%$, a Sharpe ratio of 2.63, and a maximum drawdown of $-3.59\\%$, while the S&P 500 index yielded a return of $15.97\\%$. For the BTC trading task (minute data from 27/07/2025 to 13/08/2025), our approach achieved a return of $8.39\\%$, a Sharpe ratio of $0.38$, and a maximum drawdown of $-2.80\\%$, whereas the BTC price increased by $3.80\\%$. Our code is available on \\href{https://github.com/Open-Finance-Lab/AgenticTrading}{GitHub}.", "AI": {"tldr": "An agent-based algorithmic trading framework that achieved strong performance in stock and cryptocurrency trading.", "motivation": "To democratize financial intelligence by mapping traditional algorithmic trading system components to specialized agents.", "method": "Proposed an orchestration framework with planner, orchestrator, alpha agents, risk agents, portfolio agents, backtest agents, execution agents, audit agents, and memory agent.", "result": "Stock trading: 20.42% return vs S&P 500's 15.97%; BTC trading: 8.39% return vs BTC's 3.80% price increase.
