This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize\nhigh-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training\nruns, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets.

Moreover, evaluation of LLMs\nin realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication\nsafety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework\nthat simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess\nthe medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate\ninquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a\ndedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725\ncontraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.\nA two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional\nquality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality\nconsultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs\nusing structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend\nsafe medications under simulated patient contexts.
