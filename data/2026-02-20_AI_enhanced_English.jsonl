Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways). Results reveal that hard braking and acceleration frequencies emerge as the most influential features. Such improvements are more pronounced under congested, low-speed traffic conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) using CV data to integrate micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for improved speed prediction and uncertainty estimation.", "motivation": "Accurate speed prediction is vital for proactive traffic management.

The approach aggregates system state information, including electricity demand, renewable generation, weather forecasts, and recent electricity prices, into a set of statistical features that are formatted as natural-language prompts and fed to an LLM along with general instructions. The model then determines the likelihood that the next day would be a spike day and reports a confidence score. Using historical data from the Texas electricity market, we demonstrate that this few-shot approach achieves performance comparable to supervised machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and outperforms the latter two when limited historical data are available. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a data-efficient tool for classifying electricity price spikes in settings with scarce data.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a few-shot LLM framework for predicting electricity price spikes using system state features as natural-language prompts, achieving competitive performance with supervised models in data-scarce settings.", "motivation": "There's a need for effective prediction of electricity price spikes, especially in scenarios with limited historical data, where traditional supervised machine learning models may underperform due to data scarcity.", "method": "The framework aggregates system state information (demand, renewable generation, weather forecasts, recent prices) into statistical features, formats them as natural-language prompts, and feeds them along with instructions to a Large Language Model for classification with confidence scores.", "result": "Using Texas electricity market data, the few-shot LLM approach shows performance comparable to SVM and XGBoost, and outperforms them when historical data is limited, demonstrating its efficacy.", "conclusion": "LLMs offer potential as a data-efficient tool for classifying electricity price spikes in data-scarce environments, bridging gaps where traditional models falter."}}
