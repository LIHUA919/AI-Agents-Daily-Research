### [1] [See it. Say it. Sorted: Agentic System for Compositional Diagram Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15222)
*Hantao Zhang,Jingyang Liu,Ed Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Training-free agentic system combining VLM and LLMs to convert hand sketches into precise SVG diagrams through iterative qualitative editing loops, outperforming frontier image generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with spatial precision and symbolic structure required for diagram generation, needing a solution that preserves alignment, connectivity and produces editable vector outputs.

Method: Iterative agentic system: Critic VLM proposes qualitative edits, multiple LLMs generate diverse SVG updates, Judge VLM selects best candidate. Prioritizes qualitative reasoning over numerical estimates.

Result: Outperforms GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on 10 flowchart sketches, faithfully reconstructing layout/structure, accurately composing primitives without unwanted text, producing editable SVG programs.

Conclusion: The approach effectively converts sketches to precise diagrams, preserves global constraints, supports human corrections, and is extensible to presentation tools via APIs with open-sourced implementation.

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

### [2] [Multiple Memory Systems for Enhancing the Long-term Memory of Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15294)
*Gaoke Zhang,Bo Wang,Yunlong Ma,Dongming Zhao,Zifei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multiple memory system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology improves agent memory quality by processing short-term memory into retrieval and contextual memory units, enhancing recall and response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory modules like MemoryBank and A-MEM have poor quality stored memory content, which negatively impacts recall performance and response quality in language model agents.

Method: Designed a multiple memory system (MMS) that processes short-term memory into multiple long-term memory fragments, creating paired retrieval memory units and contextual memory units with one-to-one correspondence for enhanced retrieval and response.

Result: Experiments on LoCoMo dataset showed MMS outperforms three other methods, ablation studies confirmed memory unit rationality, and analysis demonstrated robustness regarding memory segment selection and storage overhead.

Conclusion: MMS effectively constructs high-quality long-term memory content, demonstrating practical value for language model agents by better utilizing historical interaction data.

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

### [3] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning architecture using Graph Signal Processing as the computational backbone, encoding logical entities as graph signals processed via learnable spectral filters for improved logical consistency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more mathematically grounded and computationally efficient neuro-symbolic reasoning system by fully integrating symbolic logic and neural inference in the spectral domain rather than treating spectral methods as peripheral components.

Method: Formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral domain using Graph Signal Processing. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals, processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. Includes graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule grounding.

Result: Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art neuro-symbolic models.

Conclusion: Graph Signal Processing provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for robust and interpretable reasoning systems, offering significant advantages over conventional neuro-symbolic approaches.

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

### [4] [Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652)
*Ardian Selmonaj,Miroslav Strupl,Oleg Szehr,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICVs use information-theoretic Shapley values to quantify individual agent contributions in MARL by analyzing policy distributions, measuring causal influence on teammates' decision uncertainty and preference alignment without requiring value feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL evaluation focuses on overall team performance but lacks methods to understand individual agent behaviors and contributions when value function feedback is unavailable, which is crucial for reliable deployment.

Method: Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs) based on information-theoretic Shapley values that measure an agent's causal influence on co-players' instrumental empowerment by assessing decision uncertainty and preference alignment through policy distribution analysis.

Result: ICVs successfully identify beneficial agent behaviors across cooperative and competitive environments, revealing strategy diversity and distinguishing behaviors that foster deterministic decisions versus preserve future flexibility for team success.

Conclusion: The proposed ICV method provides novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances explainability in MARL systems by quantifying individual agent contributions solely from policy analysis, consistent with underlying value functions.

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

### [5] [Goals and the Structure of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013)
*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A computational framework where descriptive and prescriptive aspects of world models co-emerge from goal-directed experiences, introducing telic states as goal-equivalent experience distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the traditional separation of state representation and reward function in reinforcement learning, proposing instead that these aspects interdependently emerge from agent goals and experiences.

Method: Introduces goal-directed (telic) states defined as classes of goal-equivalent experience distributions, using statistical divergence between behavioral policies and desirable experience features.

Result: Provides a parsimonious account of goal-directed learning that unifies descriptive and prescriptive aspects, drawing from Buddhist epistemology and supported by empirical/theoretical literature.

Conclusion: This framework offers a unified account of purposeful behavior across behavioral, phenomenological and neural dimensions, potentially transforming computational models of intelligence.

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

### [6] [Language-Guided Tuning: Enhancing Numeric Optimization with Textual Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15757)
*Yuxing Lu,Yucheng Hu,Nan Sun,Xukai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LGT is a novel framework using multi-agent LLMs with natural language reasoning and textual gradients to optimize ML configurations, outperforming traditional methods while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML configuration optimization treats dimensions independently and lacks interpretability, while automated methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning.

Method: Uses multi-agent LLMs with three specialized agents (Advisor, Evaluator, Optimizer) and textual gradients for semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration interdependencies.

Result: Achieves substantial performance improvements over traditional optimization methods across six diverse datasets while maintaining high interpretability.

Conclusion: LGT provides an effective framework for intelligent configuration optimization through natural language reasoning and multi-agent coordination, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

### [7] [Collab-REC: An LLM-based Agentic Framework for Balancing Recommendations in Tourism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15030)
*Ashmi Banerjee,Fitri Nur Aisyah,Adithi Satish,Wolfgang Wörndl,Yashar Deldjoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collab-REC is a multi-agent framework using three LLM agents and a moderator to generate diverse tourism recommendations that counteract popularity bias and surface lesser-known destinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address over-tourism and popularity bias in recommendation systems by ensuring diverse, context-aware suggestions that include lesser-visited locales often overlooked by traditional approaches.

Method: Uses three LLM-based agents (Personalization, Popularity, Sustainability) generating city suggestions from different perspectives, with a non-LLM moderator conducting multi-round negotiation to merge and refine proposals while penalizing spurious or repeated responses.

Result: Experiments on European city queries show improved diversity and overall relevance compared to single-agent baseline, successfully surfacing lesser-visited destinations while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: The multi-stakeholder collaborative approach effectively addresses over-tourism and better aligns with user constraints, demonstrating promise for LLM-driven recommender systems to provide balanced, context-aware recommendations.

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

### [8] [Emergent Crowds Dynamics from Language-Driven Multi-Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15047)
*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel agent-based crowd simulation method using LLMs to generate dialogue and drive navigation, enabling more realistic social interactions and emergent group behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd simulations lack complex social and environmental interactions driven by language, limiting agent-agent and agent-environment interactions to basic steering and goal extrapolation.

Method: Uses LLMs with agent personalities, roles, and relationships to generate inter-agent dialogue, then uses conversations plus perceptual inputs to control navigation and steering decisions.

Result: Validated in complex scenarios showing automatic grouping/ungrouping of agents and information-passing within crowds, producing more realistic simulations with emergent group behaviors.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates language-driven social interactions with navigation, enabling more natural and realistic crowd simulations with emergent behaviors from environmental settings.

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [9] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Increasing reasoning budgets in LLMs worsens confidence calibration, while search-augmented generation dramatically improves accuracy by providing relevant evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models need robust calibration to avoid overconfidence in question answering, requiring systematic evaluation of how reasoning capabilities and computational budgets affect confidence assessment accuracy.

Method: Used ClimateX dataset expanded to human and planetary health domains to evaluate reasoning LLMs' confidence calibration, testing different reasoning budgets and comparing with search-augmented generation approaches.

Result: Recent reasoning LLMs achieved 48.7% accuracy in expert confidence assessment, but increasing reasoning budgets consistently impaired calibration, causing systematic overconfidence that worsened with longer thinking. Search-augmented generation dramatically outperformed pure reasoning with 89.3% accuracy.

Conclusion: Information access through evidence retrieval, rather than reasoning depth or inference budget, is the critical bottleneck for improved confidence calibration in knowledge-intensive tasks, challenging the "test-time scaling" paradigm.

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performing data analysis at the edge (onboard satellites) enables new Earth science measurements and rapid responses by processing data directly in space rather than waiting for downlink.

Method: Utilizing the CogniSAT-6 satellite equipped with visible/near infrared hyperspectral instrument and dedicated neural network acceleration hardware to run deep learning and spectral analysis algorithms directly onboard.

Result: The paper demonstrates successful implementation of data analysis and inference capabilities onboard the satellite for various applications, though specific performance metrics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: Onboard data processing using specialized hardware enables advanced Earth science applications by allowing real-time analysis and decision-making directly in space, representing a significant advancement in satellite capabilities.

Abstract: In partnership with Ubotica Technologies, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is
demonstrating state-of-the-art data analysis onboard CogniSAT-6/HAMMER (CS-6).
CS-6 is a satellite with a visible and near infrared range hyperspectral
instrument and neural network acceleration hardware. Performing data analysis
at the edge (e.g. onboard) can enable new Earth science measurements and
responses. We will demonstrate data analysis and inference onboard CS-6 for

### [11] [S3LoRA: Safe Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning in Adaptation of Agent Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15068)
*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA is a lightweight, data-free framework that improves safety in LoRA-adapted LLMs by analyzing weight updates, detecting unsafe layers via spectral sharpness metrics, and pruning them without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA fine-tuning can compromise safety alignment in LLMs, leading to unsafe behaviors in agent planning. Existing safety methods require access to multiple model checkpoints which are often unavailable.

Method: Uses Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD) to analyze LoRA updates, then applies Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI) to detect and prune unsafe layers post-hoc.

Result: Consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining utility, reduces inference cost, and works across agent planning and language generation tasks.

Conclusion: S3LoRA provides a practical, scalable solution for safe deployment of LLM-based agents in resource-constrained and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

*Jennifer Leigh,Dimitrios Letsios,Alessandro Mella,Lucio Machetti,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Workforce management as abstract argumentation enables real-time change accommodation and faithful explanations, outperforming manual solutions in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Workforce management needs to handle runtime changes and provide explanations to stakeholders, which conventional manual approaches struggle with.

Method: Model workforce management as abstract argumentation framework in an industrial application context.

Result: User study shows the tool with explanations leads to faster and more accurate problem solving compared to conventional manual solutions.

Conclusion: Abstract argumentation provides an effective framework for workforce management that accommodates changes and delivers faithful explanations.

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

*Rachel Ma,Jingyi Qu,Andreea Bobu,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GOOD is an online method that uses LLMs to infer natural language goals from human interactions in open-universe assistance games, enabling rich goal representation and uncertainty estimation without large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI agents need to interpret and act on diverse, undefined human goals and preferences in evolving environments, requiring a framework that can handle unbounded goal spaces.

Method: GOOD prompts LLMs to simulate users with complex intents, using their responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate natural language goals during interactions.

Result: The method outperforms baselines without explicit goal tracking in both text-based grocery shopping and simulated household robotics environments, as validated by LLM-based and human evaluations.

Conclusion: GOOD provides an effective, data-efficient approach for goal inference in open-universe settings, enabling embodied agents to better understand and respond to human intentions through natural language goal representations.

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of AI-generated research content faces barriers in traditional publication systems that rely on human peer review and are reluctant to accept AI work, while preprint servers lack quality control, creating a dissemination gap for high-quality AI research.

Method: Developed aiXiv with a multi-agent architecture that allows research proposals and papers to be submitted, reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. Provides API and MCP interfaces for seamless integration of heterogeneous human and AI scientists.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after iterative revising and reviewing processes on the platform.

Conclusion: aiXiv lays the groundwork for a next-generation open-access ecosystem that accelerates publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content, creating a scalable and extensible environment for autonomous scientific discovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuzzleClone is a formal framework using SMT to generate scalable, verifiable mathematical/logical puzzles for LLM training, achieving significant performance improvements on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-generated datasets suffer from limited reliability, diversity, and scalability, creating a need for high-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers to strengthen LLM reasoning capabilities.

Method: Three-step approach: (1) encode seed puzzles into structured logical specifications using SMT, (2) generate scalable variants through systematic variable and constraint randomization, (3) ensure validity via reproduction mechanism. Applied to create over 83K validated puzzles.

Result: Training on PuzzleClone datasets raised average performance from 14.4 to 56.2 on PuzzleClone testset, with consistent improvements up to 12.5 percentage points across 7 logic/mathematical benchmarks (e.g., AMC2023 from 52.5 to 65.0).

Conclusion: PuzzleClone provides an effective framework for scalable, verifiable data generation that significantly enhances LLM reasoning capabilities across mathematical and logical domains.

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM4Sweat is an open-source LLM framework that addresses hyperhidrosis diagnosis and support through synthetic data generation, fine-tuning, and expert evaluation, providing a generalizable solution for rare medical conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare medical conditions like hyperhidrosis (affecting 2-3% of population) face challenges with scarce and unreliable datasets for LLM fine-tuning, hindering their application in healthcare despite LLM potential.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Data augmentation using frontier LLM to generate synthetic medical vignettes, 2) Fine-tuning open-source foundation model for diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and psychological support, 3) Expert evaluation by clinical specialists with iterative dataset enrichment.

Result: LLM4Sweat outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for hyperhidrosis, providing accurate diagnosis, personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.

Conclusion: The framework offers a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with similar data scarcity and trustworthiness challenges, demonstrating successful application of LLMs for rare medical conditions through synthetic data generation and expert validation.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench evaluates LLM reliability on complex scheduling problems, showing performance collapses when multiple constraint types interact despite good performance on simpler precedence-only problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficient characterization of LLM reliability when reasoning under high-constraint regimes in critical sectors like capital projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT transitions.

Method: Developed R-ConstraintBench framework that evaluates models on Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP) by incrementally adding non-redundant precedence constraints, downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive constraints in Directed Acyclic Graphs.

Result: Strong LLMs perform near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs but feasibility performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows and disjunctive constraints interact. Constraint interaction, not graph depth, is the principal bottleneck. Limited generalization from synthetic to domain-grounded scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with complex constraint interactions in scheduling problems, revealing significant reliability gaps that limit their practical application in high-constraint domains despite good performance on simpler problems.

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

*Wei Yang,Jinwei Xiao,Hongming Zhang,Qingyang Zhang,Yanna Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory framework that uses multi-granularity memory grounding to enhance LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks, addressing limitations of single-granularity memory approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents rely on single-granularity memory from environmental interactions, which constrains knowledge diversity and planning flexibility due to experience quality limitations.

Method: Proposes a framework that grounds environmental information into coarse-grained focus points for experience collection, then actionable hybrid-grained tips from experiences. At inference, retrieves task-relevant experiences and tips, and uses fine-grained key information for self-QA reflection and plan correction during environmental anomalies.

Result: The framework enables flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios by fully leveraging multi-granularity memories through LLM grounding.

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory provides a novel approach to overcome limitations of single-granularity memory systems, enhancing LLM-based agents' planning capabilities through structured memory organization and retrieval.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

*Xiancheng Gao,Yufeng Shi,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPW method combines human preferences and expert demonstrations for offline RL by using similarity search to assign stepwise importance weights, enabling better credit assignment than traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL typically requires well-defined reward functions that are expensive to design. Human feedback alternatives (demonstrations and preferences) have complementary limitations - demonstrations are costly and limited, while preferences lack stepwise credit assignment.

Method: Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) searches for similar state-action pairs from expert demonstrations for each transition in preference-labeled trajectories, then derives stepwise importance weights based on similarity scores to guide preference learning.

Result: SPW enables effective joint learning from both preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that use both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: SPW successfully unifies demonstrations and preferences by solving the credit assignment problem through similarity-based weighting, making offline RL more practical without requiring expensive reward function design.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RETAIL dataset and TGMA framework to address limitations in current travel planning systems, improving performance from 1.0% to 2.72% pass rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current travel planning systems are misaligned with real-world scenarios - they assume explicit queries, ignore environmental factors, and only generate basic POI arrangements without rich details.

Method: Constructed RETAIL dataset supporting implicit queries with environmental awareness, and proposed topic-guided multi-agent framework (TGMA) for comprehensive travel planning.

Result: Existing strongest model achieved only 1.0% pass rate, while TGMA demonstrated substantially improved performance at 2.72% pass rate.

Conclusion: TGMA offers promising directions for real-world travel planning by addressing key limitations of current systems through better dataset design and multi-agent framework.

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

TL;DR: DiagECG integrates ECG signals with language models by discretizing ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens, enabling LLMs to process both ECG data and natural language for clinical text generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated ECG approaches struggle with generalization across clinical tasks and lack open-ended reasoning capabilities, limiting their diagnostic utility.

Method: Discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using lead-independent encoder and quantization, extends LLM vocabulary, pretrains on ECG forecasting, and performs instruction tuning for ECG QA and report generation.

Result: Achieves strong performance across tasks without core model modifications while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective integration of symbolic ECG representations into LLMs, highlighting potential for medical reasoning through unified multimodal processing.

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

TL;DR: Think in Blocks framework enables LLMs to dynamically adjust reasoning depth by partitioning chains-of-thought into tunable blocks based on task complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overthinking in LLMs where excessively long reasoning chains cause computational waste and slower responses, while maintaining performance on complex tasks.

Method: Three-stage training pipeline: Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning to predict optimal reasoning budget and partition reasoning into blocks.

Result: Enables adaptive reasoning from zero to deep reasoning with explicit block count prediction, allowing dynamic control of chain-of-thought length during inference.

Conclusion: The framework provides efficient and flexible reasoning by allowing LLMs to self-regulate reasoning depth based on problem difficulty, optimizing computational resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

TL;DR: Study shows that combining repeated team interactions with inter-group competition in Prisoner's Dilemma games significantly increases cooperation levels among AI language model agents, including one-shot cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate cooperative behavior in autonomous AI agents, inspired by super-additive cooperation theory which suggests repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry drive human cooperation.

Method: Virtual tournament where language model agents grouped into teams play Prisoner's Dilemma games, simulating both internal team dynamics and external competition between groups.

Result: The combination of repeated team interactions and inter-group competition substantially boosts both overall and initial one-shot cooperation levels among AI agents.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for LLMs to strategize in complex social scenarios, demonstrates how intergroup competition can paradoxically increase cooperation, and offers insights for designing cooperative multi-agent AI systems aligned with human values.

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Motivation: Existing 3D reasoning tasks have simple questions leading to short reasoning chains, limiting LLMs' complex reasoning capabilities in 3D scenes.

Method: Proposes combinatorial and iterative evolutionary approach to generate complex questions on SQA3D benchmark, then fine-tunes LLMs using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to optimize toolchain strategies.

Result: Enhanced tool usage proficiency and improved accuracy in complex 3D situated reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: DeepThink3D successfully addresses the challenge of simple questions in 3D reasoning by generating complex scenarios and optimizing LLM tool usage, leading to better performance in complex 3D reasoning tasks.

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

Result: Framework successfully identifies critical flaws in policies that appear successful based on reward alone, demonstrates repelling LCS as safety barriers and attracting LCS revealing convergence properties and trap states in both discrete and continuous control environments.

Conclusion: Provides comprehensive and interpretable assessment of policy behavior with formal safety metrics, extending to handle model uncertainty and offering a rigorous approach for verifying RL policy robustness in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

TL;DR: Agentics is a modular framework for building agent-based systems with structured reasoning and compositional generalization over complex data, focusing on data modeling rather than prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a framework that abstracts agents from logical flow and enables logical transduction among data types, allowing developers to focus on data modeling instead of crafting prompts.

Method: Uses a declarative language where data types are provided by LLMs and composed through logical transduction executed by LLMs when types are connected.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability in domain-specific multiple-choice question answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization tasks.

Conclusion: Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows, demonstrating practical applicability across various domains with open-source availability.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

*Meera Ray,Christopher L. Dancy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HDM is a vector-symbolic alternative to ACT-R's Declarative Memory that maintains compatibility with existing ACT-R models while providing scalability and similarity advantages through vector representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable vector-symbolic alternative to ACT-R's Declarative Memory system that preserves compatibility with existing models while offering architectural advantages like similarity-based retrieval and improved scaling.

Method: Adapted HDM to work with Lisp ACT-R, developed vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, created text processing pipeline for document ingestion, and implemented novel vector-based chunk retrieval mechanism using token representations.

Result: Preliminary results show HDM maintains vector-symbolic advantages (chunk recall without storage, scaling benefits) while allowing previous ACT-R models to work with minimal modifications to procedural and declarative memory components.

Conclusion: The adapted HDM module successfully bridges vector-symbolic advantages with ACT-R compatibility, with future work focusing on improved time-context representations and testing through IBL theory-based decision-making models.

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

*Mark Cote,Susana Aires*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a techno-philosophical framework using Simondonian philosophy to analyze the EU AI Act, highlighting how AI's recursive data lifecycle creates value chains that challenge Responsible AI frameworks and concentrate power in tech oligarchies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address regulatory blind spots in AI governance by examining the dynamic lifecycle of AI systems - from data ingestion to deployment - and how this generates recursive value chains that existing Responsible AI frameworks fail to capture.

Method: Cross-disciplinary approach combining technical analysis with philosophical framework (Simondonian philosophy of technology), reworking the concept of individuation to model AI lifecycle stages: pre-individual milieu, individuation, and individuated AI.

Result: Development of the concept 'futurity' to describe AI's self-reinforcing lifecycle where data enhances performance and expands applications, revealing power asymmetries and infrastructure-driven value concentration in tech oligarchies.

Conclusion: Effective AI regulation must address infrastructural and temporal dynamics through measures like lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback accountability, recursion transparency, and rights to contest recursive reuse.

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

*Cooper Elsworth,Keguo Huang,David Patterson,Ian Schneider,Robert Sedivy,Savannah Goodman,Ben Townsend,Parthasarathy Ranganathan,Jeff Dean,Amin Vahdat,Ben Gomes,James Manyika*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental impact in production, showing Gemini Apps text prompts consume 0.24 Wh energy (less than 9s TV) and 0.26 mL water, with Google achieving 33x energy reduction and 44x carbon reduction through efficiency and clean energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI adoption accelerates, understanding and mitigating environmental impact becomes crucial, but no studies had measured AI serving environmental metrics in production environments before.

Method: Comprehensive methodology measuring energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads in large-scale production, accounting for full AI serving infrastructure including active AI accelerator power, host system energy, idle capacity, and data center overhead.

Result: Median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24 Wh energy (substantially lower than public estimates) and 0.26 mL water equivalent. Google achieved 33x energy reduction and 44x carbon footprint reduction over one year through software efficiency and clean energy procurement.

Conclusion: While AI serving impacts are low compared to daily activities, comprehensive environmental measurement is critical for accurate model comparisons and incentivizing efficiency gains across the full AI serving stack.

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

*Emma Rath,Stuart Armstrong,Rebecca Gorman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using state-of-the-art language models to detect parasocial cues in AI conversations in real-time, showing promising results in identifying harmful parasocial relationships early.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parasocial relationships with AI agents can have severe negative impacts on human well-being, but preventing them is challenging as these cues emerge gradually in private conversations and not all emotional engagement is harmful.

Method: Repurposed a state-of-the-art language model to create a response evaluation framework that assesses ongoing conversations for parasocial cues. Tested with a synthetic dataset of 30 dialogues covering parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations using iterative evaluation with five-stage testing.

Result: Successfully identified all parasocial conversations with no false positives under a tolerant unanimity rule. Detection typically occurred within the first few exchanges of conversation.

Conclusion: Evaluation agents show promise as a viable solution for preventing parasocial relationships with AI, providing preliminary evidence that real-time detection of harmful parasocial cues is feasible.

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

TL;DR: A hierarchical Safe RL framework that integrates ethical reasoning with driving objectives, using ethical risk costs and prioritized experience replay to improve autonomous vehicle decision-making in real-world traffic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need robust ethical reasoning for widespread adoption, particularly for handling routine and emergency maneuvers while reducing traffic fatalities and improving transportation efficiency.

Method: Hierarchical framework with Safe RL agent trained using composite ethical risk cost (collision probability + harm severity), dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay for critical events, and polynomial path planning with PID/Stanley controllers for trajectory execution.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance on real-world traffic datasets with diverse vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians.

Conclusion: First study of ethical decision-making via Safe RL in real-world scenarios, demonstrating potential of combining control theory and data-driven learning for ethically accountable autonomy in human-mixed traffic environments.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

TL;DR: Personalized lung cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects optimal models for each patient using cohort retrieval and LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address variability in lung cancer risk prediction across different patient populations and clinical settings where no single model performs best for all cohorts.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) FAISS-based similarity search to retrieve most relevant patient cohort from multi-institutional database, 2) LLM prompting with retrieved cohort and performance metrics to recommend optimal prediction algorithm from pool of 8 models including classical, temporal, and multi-modal approaches.

Result: Enables dynamic, cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile using CT scans and structured metadata.

Conclusion: Provides flexible, cohort-driven model selection across diverse clinical populations, offering practical individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Motivation: Addressing challenges in symptom evolution complexity and insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression prediction.

Method: Integrates graph neural networks to model structural relationships among multimodal symptoms and Transformer architecture for temporal modeling, with a structure-aware gating mechanism for fusion.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1 metrics, effectively distinguishing progression stages and capturing personalized symptom trajectories.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability, providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive diseases like Parkinson's.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detect adversarial attacks in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space

Method: Uses deep neural networks to model normal agent behavior as Gaussian distributions, defines normality score, and employs two-sided CUSUM for real-time anomaly detection

Result: Achieves AUC-ROC scores over 0.95 against impactful attacks in various PettingZoo benchmarks, outperforming discrete counterparts

Conclusion: Effective decentralized detection method for adversarial attacks in continuous multi-agent environments

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

TL;DR: HHNAS-AM is a hierarchical hybrid neural architecture search method that uses adaptive mutation policies with Q-learning to efficiently explore text classification architectures, achieving 8% improvement on Spider dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NAS models for text classification lack hierarchical structure and have unorganized search spaces, making them inefficient and unable to navigate large redundant spaces effectively.

Method: Proposes hierarchical hybrid architecture search with architectural templates based on domain cues, using adaptive mutation policies with Q-learning that dynamically adjust based on performance feedback.

Result: Achieves 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines on the Spider dataset for database ID prediction task, consistently discovering high-performing architectures.

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM provides an effective probabilistic approach for organized architecture search in text classification, demonstrating significant performance improvements through hierarchical structuring and adaptive mutation strategies.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO suffers from overfitting and collapse issues despite its simplicity and training stability. The authors aim to create a more robust alignment framework.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Gradient decoupling using absolute difference loss instead of log-sigmoid, 2) Stability improvement via offset constraint with positive regularization, 3) Controllable rejection suppression with gradient separation and tunable coefficient.

Result: LPO consistently improves performance across various tasks including general text, math, and text-to-speech tasks, demonstrating robust and tunable preference alignment.

Conclusion: LPO establishes itself as a robust alternative to DPO with better stability and performance, with all source code, models, and training data released publicly.

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

Motivation: Existing methods only transfer user representations and fail to utilize valuable item and cross representations, leaving performance gains untapped in online advertising recommendation systems.

Method: Proposes LFM4Ads framework that comprehensively transfers all representations, identifies optimal extraction layers for cross representations, and employs multi-granularity transfer including non-linear adapters, Isomorphic Interaction Module, and Standalone Retrieval.

Result: Successfully deployed at Tencent's industrial-scale platform, achieving 10+ production launches with 2.45% overall GMV lift and estimated annual revenue increases in hundreds of millions of dollars.

Conclusion: LFM4Ads demonstrates that comprehensive representation transfer with multi-granularity mechanisms significantly improves advertising recommendation performance and delivers substantial business value.

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

*Samuel Yen-Chi Chen,Prayag Tiwari*

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to

time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing

task-specific. To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end
differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture
selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently
outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test
settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum
sequence learning.

*Anurup Naskar,Nathanael Zhixin Wong,Sara Shamekh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CuMoLoS-MAE is a curriculum-guided Monte Carlo ensemble masked autoencoder that restores atmospheric profiles from remote sensing data while providing pixel-wise uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional atmospheric profile restoration methods blur fine-scale features and lack uncertainty quantification, while deep learning models don't provide confidence estimates for their reconstructions.

Method: Uses a curriculum-guided training approach with progressive masking ratios, and at inference performs Monte Carlo sampling over random mask realizations to generate ensemble predictions and uncertainty maps.

Result: The method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of fine-scale atmospheric features (updrafts, downdrafts, shear lines, vortices) with per-pixel uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: CuMoLoS-MAE enables enhanced convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves long-term climate reanalysis through its uncertainty-aware reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

### [48] [Generative Neural Operators of Log-Complexity Can Simultaneously Solve Infinitely Many Convex Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14995)
*Anastasis Kratsios,Ariel Neufeld,Philipp Schmocker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper bridges the theory-practice gap for neural operators by showing that generative equilibrium operators (GEOs) can approximate solutions to convex optimization problems with logarithmic parameter growth in error tolerance, validated on PDEs, optimal control, and finance problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a significant gap between theoretical worst-case parameter bounds for neural operators (suggesting unrealistically large models) and experimental evidence showing their practical effectiveness. This paper aims to close this gap for a specific class of neural operators.

Method: The authors use generative equilibrium operators (GEOs) with finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers to solve families of convex optimization problems over separable Hilbert spaces. The inputs are smooth convex loss functions, and outputs are approximate solutions to the corresponding optimization problems.

Result: The paper demonstrates that when input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional compact sets, GEOs can uniformly approximate solutions with arbitrary precision, requiring only logarithmic growth in rank, depth, and width relative to the reciprocal of approximation error.

Conclusion: The theoretical results are validated on three applications: nonlinear PDEs, stochastic optimal control problems, and hedging problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints, confirming both the theoretical bounds and practical trainability of GEOs.

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A system combining static compiler analysis with Monte Carlo Tree Search for automated partitioning of large ML models across distributed accelerators, overcoming memory constraints and performance issues of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auto-partitioners for ML model partitioning suffer from out-of-memory errors, slow exploration of exponential search space, and sub-optimal solutions due to artificial search space restrictions.

Method: Combines novel static compiler analysis (identifying tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding and partitioning conflicts) with Monte Carlo Tree Search to construct an efficient decision space.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering previously unknown superior solutions with full automation.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides an effective automated solution for partitioning large ML models, overcoming memory constraints and achieving optimal performance through intelligent search space construction and exploration.

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEAL is an interpretable graph neural network that attributes molecular property predictions to meaningful substructures, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and human-aligned interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks for molecular property prediction lack interpretability, which limits trust in critical applications like drug discovery. Existing explanation techniques fail to reliably quantify atom/substructure contributions due to entangled message-passing dynamics.

Method: SEAL decomposes input molecular graphs into chemically relevant fragments and estimates their causal influence on outputs by explicitly reducing inter-fragment message passing in the proposed architecture.

Result: Extensive evaluations show SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. User study confirms it provides more intuitive and trustworthy explanations to domain experts.

Conclusion: SEAL bridges the gap between predictive performance and interpretability, offering a promising direction for more transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more

### [52] [Twin-Boot: Uncertainty-Aware Optimization via Online Two-Sample Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15019)
*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Twin-Boot is a gradient descent method that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization by training two identical models on bootstrap samples with periodic resets to keep them in the same basin, providing regularization and improved calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient descent lacks confidence measures, especially problematic in overparameterized/low-data regimes where models easily overfit. Bootstrapping is impractical for deep learning due to computational cost, inability to guide learning, and assumptions that fail in non-convex landscapes.

Method: Train two identical models in parallel on independent bootstrap samples. Use periodic mean-reset to keep trajectories in the same basin so divergence reflects local uncertainty. Use uncertainty estimates to sample weights adaptively for regularization favoring flatter solutions.

Result: The approach improves calibration and generalization in deep neural networks and complex high-dimensional inverse problems, and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Conclusion: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent successfully integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization, addressing limitations of standard bootstrapping while providing practical uncertainty quantification and regularization benefits.

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

TL;DR: Federated learning improves convergence for nonlinear system identification as client count increases, with feature map design enabling better performance than centralized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish theoretical guarantees for federated nonlinear system identification and demonstrate its advantages over centralized methods, particularly how increasing client participation improves convergence rates.

Method: Federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems using theoretical analysis and experimental validation with physical systems driven by i.i.d. control inputs and random perturbations. Experiments use nonlinear dynamical systems with real-analytic feature functions including polynomial and trigonometric components.

Result: Convergence rate improves as number of clients increases. Federated learning consistently improves convergence of individual clients. The method performs well under varying noise levels and data distributions, with feature map choice enabling increased excitation and better performance.

Conclusion: Federated learning is effective for nonlinear system identification, offering improved convergence compared to centralized approaches, with performance scaling positively with client participation and benefiting from careful feature map design.

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses computational challenges in deep neural network training by proposing a systematic solution for layer-freezing with feature map caching, including similarity-aware channel augmentation and progressive compression to maintain accuracy while reducing storage and computation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional layer-freezing methods still require forward propagation through frozen layers, limiting computational cost reduction. The feature map caching approach presents overlooked challenges like effective augmentation application and substantial storage overhead that need to be addressed.

Method: Proposes similarity-aware channel augmentation to cache channels with high augmentation sensitivity with minimal storage cost, and incorporates lossy data compression with progressive compression strategy that increases compression rates as more layers are frozen.

Result: Achieves significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with only minor time overhead. Provides comprehensive evaluation of freezing and compression strategies for efficient DNN training.

Conclusion: The paper presents the first comprehensive exploration of challenges in feature map caching for layer-freezing and provides a systematic solution that effectively reduces computational and storage costs while preserving model performance.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

*Syomantak Chaudhuri,Jerry Li,Thomas A. Courtade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tight minimax rates for robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption rates, showing optimal estimators discard samples beyond a corruption threshold determined by the empirical distribution of corruption rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses robust estimation in settings with non-identical corruption probabilities per sample, which naturally occurs in distributed learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, where existing methods assume uniform corruption.

Method: Theoretical analysis of minimax rates for mean estimation of multivariate bounded distributions, univariate Gaussian distributions, multivariate Gaussian mean estimation, and linear regression under heterogeneous corruption patterns.

Result: Established tight minimax rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns in mean estimation, and minimax rates for squared error up to a factor of √d for multivariate Gaussian mean estimation and linear regression.

Conclusion: Optimal estimators should discard samples beyond a certain corruption threshold determined by the empirical distribution of corruption rates, providing guidance for robust estimation in heterogeneous corruption settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes NGN-M, a momentum-based optimizer with adaptive step-size that improves stability and matches state-of-the-art performance while requiring less restrictive assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern momentum and adaptive step-size optimizers are highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, especially step-size, making tuning difficult and resource-intensive. Recent efforts focus on improving stability across hyperparameter ranges.

Method: Introduces NGN-M algorithm that combines momentum with a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method. The approach achieves standard convergence rates under less restrictive assumptions without needing interpolation conditions or bounded gradient/iterate assumptions.

Result: The proposed NGN-M optimizer attains O(1/√K) convergence rate under weaker assumptions and demonstrates enhanced robustness to step-size hyperparameter choices while delivering comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art optimizers.

Conclusion: Combining NGN step-size adaptation with momentum creates a more stable and robust optimizer that maintains competitive performance while reducing sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, addressing key limitations of current optimization methods.

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

*Yen-Lung Lai,Zhe Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DNNs in overparameterized regimes exhibit feature space collapse that improves generalization but leads to degeneracy with more layers, where distinct inputs map to same outputs. A 'wormhole' solution bypasses this degeneracy and reconciles meaningful labels with random ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the generalization behavior of deep neural networks, particularly the phenomenon of 'fooling examples' where DNNs confidently classify random/unstructured inputs that humans cannot recognize.

Method: Introduces an analytical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation without conventional gradient-based optimization or explicit labels. Examines DNN behavior in overparameterized regimes and develops a 'wormhole' solution to address degeneracy.

Result: DNNs in overparameterized regimes show output feature space collapse that improves generalization, but adding more layers causes degeneracy (trivial solutions with zero loss). The wormhole solution successfully bypasses this degeneracy and reconciles meaningful labels with random fooling examples.

Conclusion: Provides deeper insights into DNN generalization mechanisms and shortcut learning. Highlights directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised settings to bridge theory-practice gaps.

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

*Moghis Fereidouni,Muhammad Umair Haider,Peizhong Ju,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAEs reduce polysemanticity and enable more precise concept-level control through targeted suppression methods like APP, though increased sparsity doesn't always improve separability and can harm performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polysemanticity in LLM neurons makes interpretation difficult. While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are proposed to address this, there's no quantitative comparison showing if they actually improve monosemanticity over base models.

Method: Introduced concept separability score based on Jensen-Shannon distance, evaluated Gemma-2-2B with multiple SAE variants across 5 benchmarks, and developed Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP) for targeted concept suppression.

Result: SAEs reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability than base models, but greater sparsity doesn't always improve separability and often impairs downstream performance. APP method outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Conclusion: SAEs effectively mitigate polysemanticity and enable more precise concept-level interventions, with the proposed APP method showing superior performance for targeted concept suppression compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted

### [59] [Hydra: A 1.6B-Parameter State-Space Language Model with Sparse Attention, Mixture-of-Experts, and Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15099)
*Siddharth Chaudhary,Bennett Browning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra is a hybrid long-context language model architecture combining SSM backbone, sparse attention, MoE routing, and dual memory systems within ~1.6B parameters, designed for efficient long-context processing with modular components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create efficient long-context language models that combine the benefits of SSM efficiency, sparse attention mechanisms, MoE capacity scaling, and learnable memory systems in a modular architecture.

Method: Integrates Mamba-style SSM backbone with intermittent sparse global attention, chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual memory systems (workspace + factual PKM). Uses formal component interfaces, parameter accounting, and staged curriculum training.

Result: Toy-scale prototype measurements demonstrate implementation feasibility, long-context throughput crossover, and controllable expert routing behaviors on synthetic data (tens of millions of parameters).

Conclusion: Hydra presents a blueprint for modular, input-adaptive long-context models combining multiple efficient architectures, but requires future validation at target scale for competitive performance.

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

*Shaswati Saha,Sourajit Saha,Manas Gaur,Tejas Gokhale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Concept Erasure Techniques (CETs) for text-to-image models can be easily bypassed using hierarchical and compositional prompts, suffer from attribute leakage, and exhibit attention concentration/dispersal side effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy, copyright, and safety concerns in text-to-image generative models by developing effective concept erasure techniques that prevent generation of unwanted target concepts while maintaining image quality for other concepts.

Method: Developed Side Effect Evaluation (SEE) benchmark with hierarchical and compositional prompts to test CET robustness across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets, and attribute leakage.

Result: CETs can be circumvented using superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, suffer from attribute leakage, and exhibit counterintuitive attention concentration or dispersal phenomena.

Conclusion: Current CETs have significant vulnerabilities and side effects, necessitating more robust concept erasure methods. The authors release dataset, code, and evaluation tools to support future research.

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

*Sk Miraj Ahmed,Umit Yigit Basaran,Dripta S. Raychaudhuri,Arindam Dutta,Rohit Kundu,Fahim Faisal Niloy,Basak Guler,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for source-free machine unlearning that can remove private/copyrighted data from trained models without access to original training data, using Hessian estimation to enable efficient zero-shot unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods require access to the entire training dataset, which is impractical in real-world scenarios where original data may be inaccessible due to privacy regulations or other constraints.

Method: Presents a method that estimates the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, leveraging this estimation technique to enable efficient zero-shot unlearning without requiring the original training dataset.

Result: The method provides robust theoretical guarantees on unlearning performance while maintaining performance on the remaining data, with extensive experiments across multiple datasets verifying its efficacy.

Conclusion: The proposed source-free unlearning approach successfully addresses the practical challenge of removing specific data from trained models without access to original training data, making machine unlearning more feasible in real-world applications.

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

TL;DR: This paper introduces universal reinforcement learning (URL), a categorial generalization of RL using mathematical abstractions from coinduction, universal coalgebras, topos theory, and distributed computation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more powerful mathematical foundation for reinforcement learning by leveraging category theory and coalgebraic structures, enabling better understanding of asynchronous distributed algorithms and generalization of RL concepts.

Method: Uses category theory and functors to model RL algorithms, introduces universal coalgebras to represent various dynamical systems (MDPs, POMDPs, PSRs, LDSs), and generalizes fixed-point finding in RL to determining final coalgebras asynchronously in distributed settings.

Result: Develops a comprehensive categorial framework for RL that unifies various dynamical system models as coalgebras and provides mathematical tools for analyzing asynchronous distributed reinforcement learning algorithms.

Conclusion: The universal reinforcement learning framework provides a powerful mathematical abstraction that generalizes traditional RL, enables better analysis of distributed algorithms, and offers new insights through category theory and coalgebraic structures.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent proliferation of differentially private ML papers claiming state-of-the-art results without consensus on effectiveness, complicated by heterogeneity in implementations and experimental setups making direct comparisons difficult.

Method: Conducted reproducibility and replicability experiments on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from recent literature, testing them outside their initial experimental conditions.

Result: Varied outcomes - some methods performed as claimed while others faltered when tested in different conditions, highlighting the fragility of certain DPML approaches.

Conclusion: Identified unique reproducibility challenges in DPML (additional randomness from DP noise) and derived best practices for obtaining scientifically valid and reliable results in differentially private machine learning research.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

TL;DR: SafeLLM is an unlearning-based defense framework that removes harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and general capabilities, achieving substantial jailbreak attack reduction without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak attacks pose serious threats to LLM safety by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms, causing models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic unsafe output detection using hybrid external classifiers and model-internal evaluations, (2) token-level harmful content tracing through FFN activations to localize harmful knowledge, and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without degrading model quality.

Result: Substantially reduces attack success rates on prominent LLMs (Vicuna, LLaMA, GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks while maintaining high general-purpose performance. Outperforms standard defense methods like supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

Conclusion: Unlearning is a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety, offering stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and greater robustness to unseen attacks while maintaining general performance.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

TL;DR: FairPrep is a benchmarking framework for evaluating fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular data, addressing the lack of standardized tools in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-processing methods for algorithmic fairness have received less attention than in-processing and post-processing approaches, despite advantages like model-agnosticism and better privacy compliance. There's a need for standardized evaluation tools for data-level fairness interventions.

Method: Built on AIF360 platform, FairPrep provides an extensible and modular framework with batch-processing interface for seamless integration of datasets, fairness interventions, and predictive models. It enables efficient experimentation with automatic reporting of fairness and utility metrics.

Result: The framework offers standardized pipelines and supports reproducible evaluations of pre-processing fairness techniques, filling a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking landscape.

Conclusion: FairPrep provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness research by enabling systematic evaluation and comparison of pre-processing methods for algorithmic fairness.

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness

TL;DR: Enhanced tensor neural networks with frequency-adaptive approach using random Fourier features to overcome Frequency Principle limitations in high-dimensional multi-scale problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) suffer from Frequency Principle limitations that restrict their ability to capture high-frequency features in high-dimensional problems, similar to conventional neural networks.

Method: Proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs algorithm incorporating random Fourier features and leveraging TNNs' tensor structure to extract frequency features via Discrete Fourier Transform on one-dimensional component functions, mitigating curse of dimensionality.

Result: Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the enhanced expressivity and effectiveness of the proposed approach in solving complex high-dimensional multi-scale problems.

Conclusion: The frequency-adaptive TNNs algorithm significantly improves TNNs' capability to handle multi-scale problems by effectively addressing frequency limitations while maintaining computational efficiency in high dimensions.

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

TL;DR: SleepDIFFormer - a transformer-based method for automated sleep stage classification using joint EEG-EOG signals with cross-domain alignment to improve generalization across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual sleep stage classification is time-consuming and error-prone. Existing ML/DL methods struggle with non-stationarity and variability of EEG/EOG signals, leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets.

Method: Developed Multivariate Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) with MDTA architecture for joint EEG-EOG representation learning, using cross-domain alignment to mitigate attention noise and learn domain-invariant features.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on five different sleep staging datasets, with thorough ablation analyses showing the method's effectiveness and interpretability through differential attention weights.

Conclusion: SleepDIFFormer advances automated sleep stage classification with improved generalization capabilities, showing relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns and potential for sleep quality assessment applications.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-Attribution Learning (MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates multiple attribution mechanisms instead of using just one, achieving significant performance improvements in both offline and online metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CVR prediction approaches use only one attribution mechanism, discarding valuable signals from alternative attribution perspectives that could provide complementary insights into user conversion patterns.

Method: MAL framework with two components: Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) as multi-task learner integrating diverse attribution labels, and Primary Target Predictor (PTP) for calibrated conversion probabilities. Uses CAT training strategy with Cartesian product of attribution labels for enriched supervision.

Result: Offline: +0.51% GAUC improvement. Online: +2.6% increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Conclusion: Integrating multiple attribution perspectives through the MAL framework significantly enhances CVR prediction performance while maintaining compatibility with industrial deployment requirements.

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for synthesizing Pareto-optimal interpretations of black-box ML models with local optimality guarantees, balancing accuracy and explainability using SAT-based verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-objective interpretation synthesis either lack formal guarantees on Pareto-optimality or face severe scalability limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space.

Method: Uses multi-objective learning/search techniques (like Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search) to generate Pareto-optimal candidates, then verifies local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem solved with a SAT solver.

Result: The approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods offering global guarantees, demonstrating efficacy on benchmark comparisons.

Conclusion: The framework enables more scalable synthesis of interpretations with local optimality guarantees, addressing the trade-off between accuracy and explainability in black-box model interpretation.

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Poly-window contrastive learning framework for ECG analysis that extracts multiple temporal windows to learn temporally invariant features, outperforming traditional two-view methods with higher efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for ECG analysis are constrained by limited annotated data, and existing self-supervised methods fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG recordings by only generating pairwise augmented views.

Method: Extracts multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics, inspired by slow feature analysis to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features.

Result: Achieved higher AUROC (0.891 vs 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs 0.679) on PTB-XL dataset, with 4x fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs 128) and 14.8% total pre-training time reduction compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: Poly-window contrastive learning is a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated ECG analysis, providing a promising general framework for self-supervised representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks

However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think

### [73] [Evaluating Knowledge Graph Complexity via Semantic, Spectral, and Structural Metrics for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15291)
*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSG complexity metric fails in KG link prediction - sensitive to parameters, doesn't scale with classes, and shows weak correlation with performance metrics. Better alternatives include relation entropy and diversity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) as a dataset complexity metric for knowledge graph link prediction, and to examine its claimed properties of scaling with class cardinality and correlating with downstream performance.

Method: Critical examination of CSG in multi-relational link prediction using transformer-derived embeddings, introduction of structural and semantic KG complexity metrics (Relation Entropy, Maximum Relation Diversity, Relation Type Cardinality), and benchmarking against standard performance metrics (MRR, Hit@1, Hit@10).

Result: CSG is highly sensitive to parametrization, doesn't robustly scale with number of classes, and shows weak/inconsistent correlation with MRR and Hit@1. Relation-based metrics (entropy, diversity, cardinality) show strong inverse correlation with performance, while graph connectivity measures correlate positively with Hit@10.

Conclusion: CSG's claimed stability and generalization predictive power fail in link prediction settings. Relation-based complexity metrics are more faithful indicators of task difficulty, highlighting the need for stable, interpretable, and task-aligned complexity measures in knowledge-driven learning.

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

*Zhaorui Tan,Yijie Hu,Xi Yang,Qiufeng Wang,Anh Nguyen,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PL-Reg introduces partial-logic regularization to handle unknown classes in visual classification, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require fully defined logical formulas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for handling unknown classes either favor known classes (class discovery) or suffer from catastrophic forgetting (incremental learning). Logic-based methods like L-Reg require fully defined formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown classes.

Method: PL-Reg uses partial-logic regularization that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas, enabling better adaptability to unknown classes. The approach is formally demonstrated to work with partial logic for unknown class tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery, and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks show consistent performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: Partial logic regularization effectively addresses challenges with unknown classes in visual classification, providing improved generalization capabilities compared to fully defined logic approaches.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

*Saleh Afzoon,Amin Beheshti,Nabi Rezvani,Farshad Khunjush,Usman Naseem,John McMahon,Zahra Fathollahi,Mahdieh Labani,Wathiq Mansoor,Xuyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExBigBang is a hybrid text-tabular approach using transformers for contextual persona classification with explainable AI techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional persona classification models lack contextual integration of textual and tabular data, and suffer from poor explainability, making predictions difficult to interpret.

Method: Hybrid transformer-based architecture combining text and tabular data, incorporating metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling through a cyclical process that dynamically updates with evolving user behaviors.

Result: Experiments show robustness on benchmark datasets, ablation study confirms benefits of combining text and tabular data, and XAI techniques provide interpretable predictions.

Conclusion: ExBigBang successfully addresses contextual integration and explainability challenges in persona classification, offering a dynamic and interpretable solution for user-centric design.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

*Omri Ben-Dov,Samira Samadi,Amartya Sanyal,Alexandru Ţifrea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-users can strategically relabel their own data to improve model fairness without changing the firm's training process, achieving significant fairness gains with minimal impact on overall accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often preserve biases from training data, and existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques incur utility costs and require organizational buy-in. End-users who contribute data can take collective action to address fairness issues.

Method: Three practical, model-agnostic methods for approximating ideal relabeling, where a coordinated minority group strategically relabels its own data within the Algorithmic Collective Action framework.

Result: A subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with only a small impact on overall prediction error, validated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: End-users can effectively induce fairness through coordinated data relabeling without requiring changes to the firm's training process, providing a practical alternative to firm-side bias mitigation techniques.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

### [78] [EvoFormer: Learning Dynamic Graph-Level Representations with Structural and Temporal Bias Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15378)
*Haodi Zhong,Liuxin Zou,Di Wang,Bo Wang,Zhenxing Niu,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoFormer is a Transformer framework that addresses structural visit bias and abrupt evolution blindness in dynamic graph embedding through structure-aware encoding and evolution-sensitive temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic graph embedding methods suffer from Structural Visit Bias (uneven node sampling favoring high-degree nodes) and Abrupt Evolution Blindness (inability to detect sudden structural changes), leading to noisy representations and inconsistent temporal embeddings.

Method: EvoFormer uses: 1) Structure-Aware Transformer Module with positional encoding based on node structural roles to mitigate structural bias; 2) Evolution-Sensitive Temporal Module with three-step strategy: random walk timestamp classification, graph-level temporal segmentation, and segment-aware temporal self-attention with edge evolution prediction.

Result: Extensive evaluations on five benchmark datasets show EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: EvoFormer effectively corrects structural and temporal biases in dynamic graph embedding, demonstrating superior performance in capturing structural evolution and adapting to rapid temporal shifts.

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of large-scale benchmark datasets for heterogeneous text-attributed graphs, which hinders the development and fair comparison of representation learning methods on such graphs.

Method: Introduces CITE dataset with standardized evaluation procedures, conducts extensive benchmarking on node classification task, and compares four learning paradigms: homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph models, LLM-centric models, and LLM+Graph models.

Result: Created a comprehensive benchmark dataset (438K nodes, 1.2M edges, 4 relation types) and established evaluation protocols for heterogeneous text-attributed graphs in catalytic materials domain.

Conclusion: CITE provides a valuable resource for advancing representation learning on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs, enabling fair comparisons and supporting diverse modeling approaches through standardized benchmarks.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across

TL;DR: An evolving fuzzy system for federated learning that dynamically adapts to new clusters without requiring pre-specified cluster numbers, outperforming traditional methods on UCI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods require pre-specifying the number of clusters, which is impractical in federated learning settings where data is decentralized and privacy-sensitive.

Method: Evolving fuzzy system integrated with federated learning framework using PyTorch, allowing local model training on client devices with only parameter sharing to central server, eliminating need for apriori cluster selection.

Result: Outperformed established classification methods on multiple UCI datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in decentralized data processing despite computational intensity from overlap condition calculations.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows significant advantages for privacy-preserving decentralized learning, successfully addressing the cluster number specification problem while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

*Jun Choi,Chang-Ock Lee,Minam Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid least squares/gradient descent method for efficient DeepONet training by decomposing large linear systems into smaller branch and trunk subproblems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerate DeepONet training by leveraging the linear structure of the output with respect to last layer parameters, avoiding the infeasible direct solution of prohibitively large linear systems.

Method: Decompose the large least squares system into two smaller subproblems for branch and trunk networks separately, and solve them using a hybrid approach combining least squares for linear parameters and gradient descent for hidden layers.

Result: The method enables efficient optimization of DeepONet parameters, making training feasible for large-scale problems that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach provides an effective solution for accelerating DeepONet training while maintaining generalization to various loss functions including physics-informed unsupervised learning scenarios.

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

TL;DR: A hybrid framework for human activity recognition that first generalizes across users then rapidly adapts to individual users using few-shot learning on-device, achieving significant accuracy improvements with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human Activity Recognition models suffer from performance degradation when deployed to new users due to user-induced concept drift, requiring efficient personalization methods.

Method: Hybrid framework that updates only the classifier layer with user-specific data using few-shot learning directly on energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller.

Result: Consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73%, 17.38%, and 3.70% across three diverse HAR scenarios (RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, Ultrasound-Gesture).

Conclusion: Fast, lightweight, and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, enabling scalable and user-aware HAR systems in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a new fast measure for detecting overlapping multivariate Gaussian clusters in data streams, addressing limitations of existing dissimilarity measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning from data streams requires clustering models that adapt to conceptual drift, often resulting in overlapping clusters that need merging. Existing distribution dissimilarity measures are inadequate due to inability to handle all cluster shapes and high computational demands.

Method: Developed a new dissimilarity measure specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity, optimized for faster computation compared to existing methods.

Result: The proposed method is several times faster than compared methods and effectively detects overlapping clusters while preventing the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Conclusion: The new measure provides an efficient solution for detecting overlapping clusters in streaming data applications, overcoming computational and shape-handling limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

TL;DR: MRP uses irreversible projection transformations in hidden state space to completely eliminate harmful information from LLMs while preserving useful knowledge, enabling effective continuous unlearning and defense against relearning attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods only suppress unsafe knowledge through parametric training without completely eradicating informational traces, making them vulnerable to relearning attacks and ineffective for continuous unlearning.

Method: Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) applies irreversible projection properties by implementing projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network layers to eliminate harmful information.

Result: MRP achieves state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness while preserving natural performance, enables effective continuous unlearning, and successfully defends against relearning attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed MRP approach overcomes fundamental limitations of existing methods by completely eliminating harmful information through irreversible projections, providing a robust solution for machine unlearning in LLMs.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

TL;DR: A one-state differential equation model for dynamic molecular switches exhibits brain-like synaptic switching behavior with exact solvability, convergence, and fading memory properties, enabling stable processing of time-varying inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a mathematically tractable model that captures biologically-inspired synaptic switching behavior while maintaining desirable stability properties for neuromorphic computing applications.

Method: Analysis of a linear-in-state, nonlinear-in-input differential equation model derived from experimental dynamic molecular switches, examining its exact solvability, convergence, and fading memory properties.

Result: The model is exactly solvable and possesses mathematical properties (convergence and fading memory) that enable stable processing of sequential data, supporting its use as computational units in neuromorphic architectures.

Conclusion: This model provides theoretical foundation for using dynamic molecular switches in neuromorphic computing and inspires development of more general exactly solvable models for brain-inspired physical devices.

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaVerLy is a group local robustness verifier that improves verification efficiency by dynamically batching similar epsilon-balls for joint analysis, achieving 2.3x average speedup over traditional one-by-one verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural network verifiers for adversarial robustness are either too slow or imprecise when analyzing large sets of epsilon-balls, making them ineffective for practical use in safety-critical applications.

Method: BaVerLy dynamically constructs mini-batches of epsilon-balls with similar network computations, verifies them jointly, and uses adaptive refinement when robustness cannot be proven for a batch.

Result: BaVerLy achieves 2.3x average speedup (up to 4.1x) over traditional one-by-one verification, reducing analysis time from 24 hours to 6 hours in best cases on MNIST and CIFAR-10 networks.

Conclusion: Group local robustness verification through dynamic batching significantly improves verification efficiency while maintaining soundness and completeness, making adversarial robustness analysis more practical for large input sets.

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

*Jianhui Wang,Wenyu Zhu,Bowen Gao,Xin Hong,Ya-Qin Zhang,Wei-Ying Ma,Yanyan Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HypSeek is a hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds protein-ligand interactions in Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, improving both virtual screening and affinity ranking performance by better capturing hierarchical structures and fine-grained affinity variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Euclidean embedding methods fail to adequately capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations inherent in protein-ligand interactions, particularly in challenging cases like activity cliffs where structurally similar ligands show large affinity differences.

Method: HypSeek uses a hyperbolic representation learning framework with Lorentz-model hyperbolic space embeddings. It features a protein-guided three-tower architecture that embeds ligands, protein pockets, and sequences, leveraging the exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space for more expressive embeddings.

Result: HypSeek significantly improves early enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%), demonstrating superior performance across both fundamental drug discovery tasks.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry provides a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand modeling, enabling better capture of both global activity patterns and subtle functional differences, with significant improvements in virtual screening and affinity ranking performance.

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand

TL;DR: FairGuide is a framework that enhances graph neural network fairness by introducing new links to guide biased graph structures toward unbiased ones, using differentiable community detection and meta-gradients to improve structural fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks face fairness challenges due to biases in graph structures, and existing biased structures need guidance toward unbiased ones through new links to foster fair communities.

Method: Proposes FairGuide framework with differentiable community detection as pseudo downstream task, uses meta-gradients from fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that enhance structural fairness.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness and generalizability across various graph-based fairness tasks, with theoretical analysis demonstrating fairness generalization across downstream applications.

Conclusion: FairGuide successfully addresses graph fairness challenges by structurally guiding graphs toward unbiased configurations, enhancing fairness in downstream GNN applications through strategic link addition.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

*Wei Herng Choong,Jixing Liu,Ching-Yu Kao,Philip Sperl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRASPED is an unsupervised graph anomaly detection model that uses spectral graph wavelets for multi-scale analysis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods without requiring labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised methods suffer from scarce anomaly labels, while unsupervised approaches either rely only on spatial information or use low-pass filters that lack multi-band analysis capabilities for detecting spectral shifts caused by anomalies.

Method: Proposes GRASPED with Graph Wavelet Convolution encoder and Wiener Graph Deconvolution decoder, creating bandpass filters to capture global and local graph information at multiple scales for attribute reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world graph anomaly detection datasets show GRASPED outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The unsupervised spectral approach with multi-scale bandpass filtering effectively captures anomaly information without labeled data, demonstrating superior performance in graph anomaly detection.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for distributed learning over networks that is both computationally and communicationally efficient, as traditional methods often trade off one efficiency for the other.

Method: ADMM-based algorithm with stochastic gradients for local computation, multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and compressed transmissions to reduce communication overhead.

Result: The algorithm achieves exact linear convergence in strongly convex settings and shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques in classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully combines computational and communication efficiency in distributed learning while maintaining strong theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance.

Abstract: We address distributed learning problems over undirected networks.
Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is
jointly computation- and communication-efficient. Our design guarantees
computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during
local training. Moreover, communication efficiency is achieved as follows: i)
the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and
ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the
algorithm in the strongly convex setting. We corroborate our theoretical
results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a
classification task.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

*Salman Habib,Remi Chou,Taejoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPOF is a differentially private training method that uses polynomial approximation of loss functions with calibrated noise, outperforming DP-SGD in accuracy and efficiency for multi-user LDP scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of gradient-based differential privacy methods like DP-SGD, which suffer from computational inefficiency and instability due to gradient noise injection, particularly in multi-user local differential privacy settings with environmental noise.

Method: SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of the model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by adding calibrated noise to the polynomial coefficients instead of gradients.

Result: SPOF achieves up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to multi-user DP-SGD in WBAN scenarios with heterogeneous data and channel noise.

Conclusion: SPOF provides superior privacy-utility trade-offs, computational efficiency, and robustness to environmental noise compared to gradient-based approaches, making it particularly suitable for multi-user local differential privacy applications.

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

TL;DR: Practical early fault detection for industrial pumps using sensor data and machine learning with hybrid thresholding and synthetic fault injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable early fault detection in industrial pump systems operating in demanding environments to enable proactive maintenance and prevent failures.

Method: Monitored 5 operational parameters, used dual-threshold labeling (engineering limits + 95th percentile historical values), injected synthetic faults, and trained Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM classifiers.

Result: Random Forest and XGBoost achieved high accuracy across all classes including rare faults, while SVM showed lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual analyses confirmed robust detection capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable, interpretable, suitable for real-time deployment, and adaptable to other machinery with similar sensor architectures for predictive maintenance.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Motivation: Understanding nuanced model performance is crucial for responsible ML deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, requiring methods that can identify both high-confidence and high-uncertainty regions.

Method: Developed Conformalized Exceptional Model Mining framework with mSMoPE model class for uncertainty quantification and RAUL quality measure to identify exceptional performance subgroups in multi-class classification and regression.

Result: Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical insights into model behavior.

Conclusion: This work enhances model interpretability and reliability, advancing explainable AI and uncertainty quantification by providing rigorous coverage guarantees and explanatory power for model performance analysis.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable

*Ortal Senouf,Antoine Wehenkel,Cédric Vincent-Cuaz,Emmanuel Abbé,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new fully inductive and amortized simulation-based inference framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment using optimal transport and normalizing flows, outperforming existing methods while improving scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing SBI approaches like RoPE which require batch test samples at inference time, limiting scalability and generalization in misspecified models.

Method: Combines mini-batch optimal transport with closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations, then trains conditional normalizing flow to approximate OT-induced posterior for efficient inference.

Result: Matches or surpasses RoPE and other SBI/non-SBI estimators across synthetic and real-world benchmarks including medical biomarker estimation.

Conclusion: Proposed framework offers improved scalability and applicability in challenging misspecified environments without requiring simulation access at test time.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

TL;DR: CoNTM is a continual neural topic model that learns new topics without forgetting previous ones using a continuously updated global prior, outperforming dynamic topic models in quality and perplexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches either require the entire training corpus at once (DTMs) or lack long-term memory (Online Topic Models), creating a gap for continual learning in topic modeling.

Method: Proposes Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM) with a continuously updated global prior distribution to maintain knowledge from previous tasks while learning new ones.

Result: CoNTM consistently outperformed dynamic topic models in topic quality and predictive perplexity, learning more diverse topics and better capturing temporal changes.

Conclusion: CoNTM successfully addresses the continual learning challenge in topic modeling by preventing catastrophic forgetting while maintaining online learning capabilities.

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian analysis shows automated speech classifiers significantly distort effect size estimates in language acquisition studies, underestimating sibling effects by 20-80%. A calibration approach helps but isn't foolproof.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated classifiers for analyzing children's audio recordings have known accuracy issues, but less is known about how classification errors affect downstream statistical inferences and effect size estimates in language acquisition research.

Method: Proposes a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic classification errors on scientific questions, examining both LENA system and an open-source alternative (ACLEW's Voice Type Classifier). Uses Bayesian calibration to recover unbiased effect size estimates.

Result: Classification errors significantly distorted estimates - automated annotations underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20-80%, potentially making effects statistically non-significant. Bayesian calibration was effective but not foolproof.

Conclusion: Classification errors in automated speech analysis can substantially bias research findings in language acquisition studies. While Bayesian calibration offers a partial solution, the problem affects any classifier with non-zero error rates in event detection and classification tasks.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

*Ruihan Zhang,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework that provides formal guarantees of individual fairness throughout machine learning training, combining provably fair initialization and fairness-preserving training using randomized response mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness methods lack formal guarantees, and verification techniques alone don't actively enhance fairness during training. There's a need for approaches that both provide formal fairness guarantees and actively maintain fairness throughout the training process.

Method: Two-part approach: (1) provably fair initialization to ensure the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a fairness-preserving training algorithm using randomized response mechanisms that protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness guarantees throughout learning.

Result: Experimental evaluations confirm the approach produces models that are both empirically fair and accurate, while being more efficient than certified training methods that require neural network verification during training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully provides formal individual fairness guarantees throughout the entire training process, addressing limitations of existing methods by combining provable initialization with fairness-preserving training mechanisms.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is crucial for precision pharmacotherapy, but traditional methods require extensive modeling cycles and expert involvement.

Method: Transformer-based latent-variable framework with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over compartment model parameters, pre-trained on synthetic pharmacokinetic trajectories and using amortized in-context Bayesian inference.

Result: AICMET achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy, faithfully quantifies inter-patient variability, and outperforms both nonlinear mixed-effects baselines and neural ODE variants.

Conclusion: Transformer-based population-aware neural architectures offer a viable alternative to traditional pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, enabling truly personalized dosing regimens.

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations is challenging due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors, requiring methods that can handle both commonalities and unique variations.

Method: Multi-task learning with low-rank tensor decomposition that decomposes task model parameters into low-rank structures to capture common patterns and subpopulation-specific variations.

Result: Superior performance compared to benchmarks in simulation and case studies, especially with high subpopulation variability, showing improved prediction accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances personalized modeling by efficiently sharing knowledge between similar tasks while preserving unique subpopulation characteristics, offering both accuracy and interpretability benefits.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments are inherently multi-agent with human experts, but current research lacks open-ended multi-agent environments to study how social intelligence can help AI agents learn adaptive skills from experts.

Method: Created an open-ended multi-agent environment where self-interested agents pursue complex independent goals, enabling research on social learning, implicit cooperation, and emergent collaborative behaviors.

Result: The environment allows investigation of how social learning impacts agent performance in the presence of experts, and whether agents benefit from cooperation or competition through emergent behaviors like collaborative tool use.

Conclusion: This environment enables crucial research into developing socially intelligent AI agents that can learn adaptive behaviors through cooperation and competition in complex multi-agent settings reflective of real-world challenges.

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Motivation: To improve the capability of physics and equality constrained artificial neural networks (PECANN) for learning solutions of canonical partial differential equations with better robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding scientific computing problems.

Method: Generalized augmented Lagrangian method with multiple penalty parameters, reformulated constraint enforcement as expectations, incorporated Fourier feature mappings, introduced time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution, and proposed conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy.

Result: PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive accuracy across various problems including transonic rarefaction, reversible advection, high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse heat source identification, outperforming established methods and recent Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches.

Conclusion: The collective advances significantly improve PECANN's robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding scientific computing problems while maintaining competitive accuracy across diverse PDE cases.

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

### [104] [Investigation of D-Wave quantum annealing for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines and mitigating catastrophic forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15697)
*Abdelmoula El-Yazizi,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores modest statistical differences between D-Wave quantum annealing and classical MCMC sampling for RBMs, finding no training improvements but discovering potential for quantum annealing in catastrophic forgetting mitigation through generative replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the absence of significant improvements in RBM trainability when using D-Wave quantum annealing compared to classical MCMC sampling, and to explore whether combining both methods could yield benefits.

Method: A novel hybrid sampling approach combining classical MCMC and D-Wave quantum annealing contributions, applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines. Also investigated using QA-generated patterns for catastrophic forgetting mitigation through generative replay.

Result: No improvements in RBM training were achieved. Differences between QA and MCMC sampling were mainly in medium-to-low probability regions, which are less important for sample quality. However, QA showed promise for generating diverse patterns for catastrophic forgetting mitigation, with comparable efficiency to classical methods but faster generation of distinct patterns.

Conclusion: While quantum annealing didn't improve RBM training, it shows potential for machine learning applications requiring diverse pattern generation, particularly for catastrophic forgetting mitigation in incremental learning, due to its speed and pattern variety generation capabilities.

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

### [105] [Communication Efficient LLM Pre-training with SparseLoCo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15706)
*Amir Sarfi,Benjamin Thérien,Joel Lidin,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoCo is a communication-efficient LLM training algorithm that combines Top-k sparsification and 2-bit quantization to achieve extreme compression ratios (1-3% sparsity) while outperforming full-precision baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed training methods for LLMs still create communication bottlenecks by requiring full gradient copies, and quantization approaches have achieved limited compression without leveraging sparsification effectively.

Method: Uses Top-k sparsification and 2-bit quantization with local approximation of outer momentum through error feedback and sparse aggregation techniques.

Result: Achieves compression ratios of up to 1-3% sparsity with 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision DiLoCo in various communication-constrained LLM training settings.

Conclusion: SparseLoCo effectively addresses communication bottlenecks in distributed LLM training through extreme compression while maintaining or improving performance compared to full-precision methods.

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

### [106] [Probability Density from Latent Diffusion Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15737)
*Joonas Järve,Karl Kaspar Haavel,Meelis Kull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates why likelihood-based out-of-distribution detection often fails in practice, despite being theoretically optimal. The authors explore whether the issue lies in pixel space representation and test likelihood-based detection in feature space using a Variational Diffusion Model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety is the main bottleneck for deploying ML systems, and out-of-distribution detection is critical. While likelihood is theoretically optimal for OOD detection under uniform OOD assumption, it often fails in practice, raising questions about its practical usefulness.

Method: Trained a Variational Diffusion Model on the representation space of a pre-trained ResNet-18 (instead of pixel space) to assess likelihood-based OOD detection performance. Compared against state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Result: The paper investigates whether the failure of likelihood-based OOD detection is due to pixel space limitations rather than inherent issues with likelihood scoring. Results compared against OpenOOD benchmark methods.

Conclusion: The study aims to determine if moving from pixel space to feature space representation can improve likelihood-based OOD detection performance, potentially validating its theoretical optimality in practical settings.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Motivation: Address the performance gap between open-source and closed-source models in challenging scientific professional fields, and advance towards AGI by developing specialized generalist models for scientific multimodal data analysis.

Method: 28B parameter multimodal Mixture-of-Experts model with 241B total parameters, continually pre-trained on 5T tokens (2.5T+ scientific), followed by offline and online RL training with Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) on 1000+ tasks simultaneously.

Result: Top-tier performance in online RL training, competitive on general reasoning tasks among open-source models, significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, and surpasses closed-source SOTA models in professional tasks like molecular synthesis planning and crystal stability prediction.

Conclusion: Intern-S1 successfully bridges the gap between open-source and closed-source models in scientific domains through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and training systems, demonstrating strong potential for transforming scientific research.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

Conclusion: Alpha Berkeley establishes itself as a reliable and transparent framework for agentic systems that can effectively handle complex workflows in safety-critical environments with proper human oversight and robust orchestration.

Abstract: Coordinating workflows across heterogeneous control systems remains a central
challenge in safety-critical environments such as scientific facilities,
industrial plants, and energy infrastructures. Language-model-driven agents
offer a natural interface for these tasks, but existing approaches often lack
scalability, reliability, and human oversight. We introduce the Alpha Berkeley
Framework, a production-ready architecture for scalable agentic systems that
integrate conversational context with robust tool orchestration. The framework
features dynamic capability classification to select only relevant tools per
task, a plan-first orchestration model that generates execution plans with
explicit dependencies and optional human approval, context-aware task
extraction that combines dialogue history with external memory and domain
resources, and production-ready execution environments with checkpointing,
artifact management, and modular deployment. We demonstrate its versatility
through two case studies: a tutorial-style wind farm monitoring example and a
deployment at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator. These results
establish Alpha Berkeley as a reliable and transparent framework for agentic
systems in high-stakes domains.

*Ruiyu Zhang,Lin Nie,Xin Zhao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: HEAS is a Python framework that combines agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and tournament evaluation in a unified workflow for reproducible multi-level simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a standardized framework that unifies agent-based modeling, evolutionary optimization, and tournament evaluation to enable reliable and reproducible cross-disciplinary, multi-level research with reduced glue code.

Method: Uses hierarchical lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in deterministic layers that share a common context, with API/CLI for simulation, optimization, and evaluation. Supports PyTorch integration, multi-objective evolution, and user-defined scoring rules with standardized metrics and persistence.

Result: A practical framework that enables composition of exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators without refactoring, allowing the same model to be used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison.

Conclusion: HEAS provides a foundation for cross-disciplinary multi-level inquiry that yields reliable and reproducible results, as demonstrated through ecological and enterprise decision-making examples.

Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that
unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and
tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents
models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in
deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale
couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize,
evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy
integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament
tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes
evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,
logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,
Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving
comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from
orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators
to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be
used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We
illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an
enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for
cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible
results.
