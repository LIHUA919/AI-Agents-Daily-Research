This\npaper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable\nepistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI\nresearch asking \"what is intelligence?\" (ontological), SCL asks \"under what\nconditions does cognition emerge?\" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and\nimplementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not\nrepresentational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic\nstate through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to\nbe enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure\nrather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not\nas truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a\nphenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive\nphenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real\nprogress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive\nprinciples structurally."}

In a controlled evaluation over 30 rounds comparing 14\nsystems, Lark Full achieves a mean rank of 2.55 (95% CI [2.17, 2.93]) and a\nmean composite score of 29.4/50 (95% CI [26.34, 32.46]), finishing Top-3 in 80%\nof rounds while remaining cost competitive with leading commercial models\n($0.016 per task). Paired Wilcoxon tests confirm that all four mechanisms\ncontribute significantly as ablating duplication/maturation yields the largest\ndeficit ({\\Delta}Score = 3.5, Cohen's d_z = 2.53, p < 0.001), followed by\nplasticity ({\\Delta}Score = 3.4, d_z = 1.86), ranked-choice voting\n({\\Delta}Score = 2.4, d_z = 1.20), and token penalties ({\\Delta}Score = 2.2,\nd_z = 1.63). Rather than a formal Markov Decision Process with constrained\noptimization, Lark is a practical, compute-aware neuroevolutionary loop that\nscales stakeholder-aligned strategy generation and makes trade-offs transparent\nthrough per-step metrics. Our work presents proof-of-concept findings and\ninvites community feedback as we expand toward real-world validation studies."}

Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to\nretrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows\nGraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and\nrelevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes\nreal-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow\noutperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit\nrate and recall.

This inappropriate modeling approach\nprevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a\nsignificant degradation in detection performance after state variables are\nintegrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel\nSTate-aware AdapteR (STAR).

Empirically, we observe that the spectral density of\nthe shallow self-attention matrix V consistently evolves into a heavy-tailed\ndistribution. Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we\ndemarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed\nstructure stabilization, and convergence saturation. This staging provides\nguidance for preliminary stopping decisions. Crucially, we propose two\nconsistent and validation-free criteria: a quantitative metric for heavy-tailed\ndynamics and a novel spectral signature indicative of convergence. The strong\nalignment between these criteria highlights the utility of RMT for monitoring\nand diagnosing the progression of Transformer model training."}

In fact, each test\nenvironment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual\ntest emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test\nfocuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is\ndesirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only\none. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive\nPreference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences\nwith dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed\nto drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.\nEmploying a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased\nmodel, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected\nfeedback, leading to high performance in the factual test.

We develop a decision support system that uses a\npre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a\nsubset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along\nthe way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness\nproperties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize\nthe level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct\na large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a\nwildfire mitigation game. We find that participants who play the game supported\nby our system outperform those who play on their own by $\\sim$$30$% and the AI\nagent used by our system by $>$$2$%, even though the AI agent largely\noutperforms participants playing without support. We have made available the\ndata gathered in our human subject study as well as an open source\nimplementation of our system at\nhttps://github.com/Networks-Learning/narrowing-action-choices ."}

This has incentivized the\ncommunity to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often\nat the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics.\nPerformance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic\nbenchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult\nto transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly\ndiminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at\nimproving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points:\n(i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent\ncapabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of\nreinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our\nbenchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular\nArcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a\nbenchmark that, despite being increasingly considered \"saturated\", can be\neffectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the\ndeployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems."}

Quantization has emerged as an essential\ncompression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and\naccelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8,\nINT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in\nsensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization\noffers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across\nlayers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey\nprovides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks\nfor LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform\nand non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used\nin post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM\nframeworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision\nconfigurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative\nanalysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and\ndeployment trade-offs.

While effective in\nmany settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are\ngiven, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address\nthis issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling\nthe specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions.

We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to\ndata-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements\non data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this\nend, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method\nand naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the\ninner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget\non some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data\nselection based on model evaluation.

Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation\nwithout bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve\nexpressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of\nweaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer\nvariant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to\nstrengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the\nsecond block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very\nfirst layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections\nand V cache by nearly 50 \\%.

Entities\nacross modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming\ndiverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references.\nGraphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and\ninter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish\nmulti-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which\nfragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key\nchallenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from\nmulti-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific\ninformation in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the\nrole of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and\npropose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific,\nwe introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural\ninformation into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion.\nFurthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for\ncross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that\nleveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions\nimproves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone\nmodality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that\nGraph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines,\nachieving a 6.93% average improvement."}

During training, our method\nautomatically proposes goals and practices reaching them, building off prior\nwork in reinforcement learning exploration. During evaluation, our method\nsolves an (amortized) inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain\ndemonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior. Experiments on standard\nbenchmarks (not designed for goal-reaching) show that our approach outperforms\nprior methods for zero-shot imitation."}

When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the\nschedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed\nworst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well\nfor LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained\nresource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a\nfair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel\nscheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a\nbottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the\nservice cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses\na simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand\nprediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing\nalgorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay.\nWe have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving\ndiverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling\nefficiency with fairness preserved."}

In each round, the learner selects a vector $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a\nset $X \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\\boldsymbol{y}_t \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\\langle \\boldsymbol{x}_t, \\boldsymbol{y}_t\n\\rangle \\in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,\nincluding extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask\nlearning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is\nwell known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log |X|}\\big)$ after\n$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal\nacross all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X\n\\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\\sqrt{\\log\nd}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\\Omega\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log(|X|)/\\log\nd}\\big)$ that holds for any algorithm.

At the same time, we show that Hedge is\noptimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical\n$K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to\nestablish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path\nproblems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial\ndomains.

We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model\nDeployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human\nengineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other\nknowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an\nunfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection\nof novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new\nclasses are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in\ntraditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised\nlearning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and\nincrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the\npast data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered\nclasses, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two\nchallenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes\noften appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and\nincremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA."}

However, training of multimodal networks is typically\nhindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one\nof the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance,\nhindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal\nimprovements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the\nModality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint\nfusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in\nmodality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively\nbalance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during\ntraining to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal\nmodel, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal\npredictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion\ntasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our\nresults show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion\nmethods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during\ntraining.

Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.\npresident or an API call) does not \"average out\" by recalling another. Hence,\nwe propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when\nbackward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before\npost-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to\nquantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects\nand obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add\nchance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random\nguessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across\npost-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis\nshows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with\nlow-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base\nmodels and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on\nmath and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to\ninstruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both\nforgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed\nand warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not\nreliably mitigate forgetting.

We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions.
