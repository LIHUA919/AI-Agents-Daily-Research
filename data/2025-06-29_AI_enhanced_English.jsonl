Existing LoRA-based\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and\nfreezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and\nambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design\nintroduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts\nper input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful\ncomponents across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or\ncontradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks\nand insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features\nacross tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As\nmore experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating\nforgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with\nself-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple\nlow-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,\neach treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1\nexpert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid\nambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own\nrelevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning\nand activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per\ninput. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large\nlanguage models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain\nforgetting/generalization during fine-tuning.

Eleven medical experts curated problems, each\nincluding a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task\ndemonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer\ntriplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further\nintroduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A\ncomprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit\nmoderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended\nevaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on\nSMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant\nin-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade\nperformance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,\ni.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial\nperformance improvements by up to 71%.
