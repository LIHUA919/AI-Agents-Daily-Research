We leverage these facts to create a\nscale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a\ngiven domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.\nSince neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the\nnatural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of\nneural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the\nscale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,\nHelmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations.
