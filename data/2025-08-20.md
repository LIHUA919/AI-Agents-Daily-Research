Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-of-Agents (CoA) is a new LLM reasoning paradigm that enables end-to-end multi-agent problem solving within a single model, using distillation and reinforcement learning to create Agent Foundation Models that outperform existing multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems rely on manual prompt engineering and complex frameworks, making them computationally inefficient and unable to benefit from data-centric learning. The authors aim to create a more efficient and capable approach to multi-agent problem solving.

Method: Proposed Chain-of-Agents paradigm where LLMs dynamically activate different tool agents and role-playing agents. Used multi-agent distillation to distill existing multi-agent systems into training trajectories, followed by agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable tasks to create Agent Foundation Models.

Result: Agent Foundation Models establish new state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. The approach outperforms existing multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Agents provides an efficient end-to-end solution for complex problem solving within a single model, with open-sourced models, code, and data to advance future research on agent models and agentic reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

### [2] [Cognitive Workspace: Active Memory Management for LLMs -- An Empirical Study of Functional Infinite Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13171)
*Tao An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cognitive Workspace is a novel paradigm that improves LLM context management by emulating human cognitive mechanisms, achieving 58.6% memory reuse vs 0% for traditional RAG with significant efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs face fundamental limitations in context management despite extended context windows. Traditional retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human memory management, lacking metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities.

Method: Proposes Cognitive Workspace with three core innovations: (1) active memory management with deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Draws from cognitive science foundations including Baddeley's working memory model and Clark's extended mind thesis.

Result: Achieves average 58.6% memory reuse rate (54-60% across tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18% net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical significance confirmed with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple task types.

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace represents a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive augmentation, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory superiority in LLM systems and synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

### [3] [CardAIc-Agents: A Multimodal Framework with Hierarchical Adaptation for Cardiac Care Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13256)
*Yuting Zhang,Karina V. Bunting,Asgher Champsi,Xiaoxia Wang,Wenqi Lu,Alexander Thorley,Sandeep S Hothi,Zhaowen Qiu,Dipak Kotecha,Jinming Duan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CardAIc-Agents is a multimodal AI framework that addresses limitations in current AI systems for cardiovascular disease detection by providing adaptive reasoning, tool integration, continuous learning, and visual outputs to support clinical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, exacerbated by healthcare worker shortages. Current AI systems have limitations including rigid workflows, lack of domain-specific tools, static knowledge bases, and limited multimodal capabilities that hinder clinical application.

Method: Proposed CardAIc-Agents framework with: 1) CardiacRAG agent for generating plans from updatable cardiac knowledge, 2) chief agent with tool integration for autonomous execution, 3) stepwise update strategy for dynamic plan refinement, 4) multidisciplinary discussion tool for challenging cases, and 5) visual review panels for clinician validation.

Result: Experiments across three datasets demonstrated that CardAIc-Agents outperformed mainstream Vision-Language Models, state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs in efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: The CardAIc-Agents framework successfully addresses key limitations in AI systems for cardiovascular care by providing adaptive reasoning, continuous learning, and multimodal capabilities that support clinical decision-making and have potential to alleviate healthcare workforce shortages.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

### [4] [AlphaEval: A Comprehensive and Efficient Evaluation Framework for Formula Alpha Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13174)
*Hongjun Ding,Binqi Chen,Jinsheng Huang,Taian Guo,Zhengyang Mao,Guoyi Shao,Lutong Zou,Luchen Liu,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaEval is a unified evaluation framework for automated alpha mining that provides comprehensive multi-dimensional assessment without backtesting, addressing limitations of existing metrics and promoting reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alpha evaluation methods are limited - backtesting is computationally intensive and parameter-sensitive, while correlation metrics overlook crucial properties like stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. The closed-source nature of most models also hinders progress.

Method: Proposed AlphaEval framework evaluates generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and diversity. It's unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free.

Result: Extensive experiments show AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to comprehensive backtesting while providing more comprehensive insights and higher efficiency. It effectively identifies superior alphas compared to traditional single-metric approaches.

Conclusion: AlphaEval addresses key challenges in alpha mining evaluation by offering a comprehensive, efficient, and reproducible framework that assesses multiple quality dimensions, with open-source implementation to promote community engagement and progress.

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

### [5] [Fitting Ontologies and Constraints to Relational Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13176)
*Simon Hosemann,Jean Christoph Jung,Carsten Lutz,Sebastian Rudolph*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the computational complexity and algorithms for fitting ontologies and constraints (description logics and TGDs) to positive/negative examples represented as finite relational structures, and investigates finite basis construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of automatically constructing ontologies and constraints from example data, which is important for knowledge representation and database systems where manual specification is challenging.

Method: The study considers description logics EL and ELI, various classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs), and inclusion dependencies. It analyzes computational complexity, designs algorithms, and examines ontology/TGD size for fitting problems.

Result: The research pinpoints exact computational complexity for different ontology and constraint languages, provides algorithms for fitting, and shows that finite bases exist for EL, ELI, guarded TGDs, and inclusion dependencies but not for full, frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

Conclusion: The work provides a comprehensive complexity analysis and algorithmic solutions for ontology and constraint fitting problems, revealing fundamental limitations on finite basis existence for certain TGD classes while establishing positive results for others.

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

### [7] [The Interpretability Analysis of the Model Can Bring Improvements to the Text-to-SQL Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13178)
*Cong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CESQL model integrates interpretability analysis and execution guidance for WHERE clause parsing, achieving superior accuracy on WikiSQL dataset with reduced data dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve text-to-SQL model capabilities and generalization for real-world applications by enhancing semantic parsing of WHERE clauses in SQL queries.

Method: Combines model interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy, filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion for conditional enhancement.

Result: Excels on WikiSQL dataset for single-table queries, significantly boosts prediction accuracy, reduces dependency on condition column data, and avoids impact of manual training labels.

Conclusion: Provides fresh perspectives for handling complex queries and irregular data scenarios in real-world database environments through enhanced basic query processing.

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

### [8] [Search-Time Data Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13180)
*Ziwen Han,Meher Mankikar,Julian Michael,Zifan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Search-time contamination (STC) is a new form of data leakage where search-based LLM agents find evaluation datasets with ground truth answers online, enabling them to copy answers instead of reasoning, which compromises benchmark integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address a novel form of data contamination in search-based LLM agents where retrieval tools can access evaluation datasets containing test questions and answers, undermining the validity of benchmark evaluations.

Method: Analyzed search-based agent logs to identify contamination sources, specifically examining HuggingFace as a platform hosting evaluation datasets. Conducted experiments on three benchmarks (HLE, SimpleQA, GPQA) and performed ablation studies to measure contamination effects and accuracy drops when blocking contaminated sources.

Result: Found that ~3% of questions were contaminated with agents directly accessing datasets with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When blocking HuggingFace, observed ~15% accuracy drop on contaminated subsets. Also identified that HuggingFace may not be the sole source of STC.

Conclusion: Proposed best practices for benchmark design and result reporting to address search-time contamination, and released complete experiment logs to facilitate auditing of evaluation results for trustworthy assessment of search-based LLM agents.

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

### [9] [QuickMerge++: Fast Token Merging with Autoregressive Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13204)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuickMerge is a lightweight token merging framework that reduces computational costs by dynamically selecting fewer tokens based on attention norms, enabling efficient next-token prediction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and video domains, token-level computation has become a major bottleneck. Most existing token selection methods are static, modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation.

Method: QuickMerge dynamically selects reduced tokens using attention norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. It introduces a lightweight transformer prior trained over merged token sequences to preserve autoregressive compatibility.

Result: QuickMerge demonstrates consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs across multi-modality domains, substantially reducing token counts while matching or exceeding performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines semantic salience estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment to enable accurate generation with fewer tokens, addressing the computational bottleneck in large-scale generative models.

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

### [10] [AI sustains higher strategic tension than humans in chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13213)
*Adamo Cerioli,Edward D. Lee,Vito D. P. Servedio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI chess players sustain higher strategic tension longer than humans, with tension levels increasing at specific Elo thresholds in human play, revealing different cognitive approaches between AI and human strategic decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how strategic decision-making differs between humans and AI in chess, particularly in managing the trade-off between immediate opportunities and long-term objectives.

Method: Proposed a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to quantify strategic tension on the chess board, analyzing evolution of tension in human vs human and AI vs AI games across different skill levels.

Result: AI players maintain higher levels of strategic tension for longer durations than elite human players. Human tension increases abruptly at ~1600 Elo and again at ~2300 Elo. AI tolerates complex interconnected positions while humans limit tension and complexity.

Conclusion: The difference in strategic tension management between AI and humans reflects cognitive limitations in humans versus algorithmic capabilities in AI, with implications for AI usage in complex strategic environments.

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

### [11] [Explicit v.s. Implicit Memory: Exploring Multi-hop Complex Reasoning Over Personalized Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13250)
*Zeyu Zhang,Yang Zhang,Haoran Tan,Rui Li,Xu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-hop personalized reasoning task to evaluate memory mechanisms in LLM agents for complex reasoning over user information, introduces a dataset and evaluation framework, implements various memory methods, and proposes HybridMem as an effective hybrid solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory approaches in LLM agents focus mainly on preference alignment and simple QA, but real-world complex tasks require multi-hop reasoning over large amounts of personalized user information, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: The authors define the multi-hop personalized reasoning task, construct a dataset, create a unified evaluation framework, implement various explicit and implicit memory methods, and propose HybridMem - a hybrid approach combining both paradigms.

Result: Comprehensive experiments evaluate different memory methods from multiple perspectives, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. The proposed HybridMem method demonstrates effectiveness through extensive testing.

Conclusion: The research addresses limitations in current memory approaches for complex personalized reasoning tasks and provides a valuable framework and dataset for the community, with HybridMem showing promising results for multi-hop reasoning over personalized information.

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at
https://github.com/nuster1128/MPR.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Much materials data remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables in scientific literature, hindering AI-driven materials discovery despite unprecedented data availability.

Method: Descriptive Interpretation of Visual Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow that systematically reads and organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific papers, focusing on solid-state hydrogen storage materials.

Result: DIVE improves data extraction accuracy by 10-15% over commercial models and over 30% relative to open-source models. Built a curated database of 30,000+ entries from 4,000 publications and established a rapid inverse design workflow that identifies previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in two minutes.

Conclusion: The AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials discovery by effectively unlocking trapped data in scientific literature.

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

### [14] [HiFo-Prompt: Prompting with Hindsight and Foresight for LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13333)
*Chentong Chen,Mengyuan Zhong,Jianyong Sun,Ye Fan,Jialong Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiFo-Prompt framework uses Foresight and Hindsight prompting strategies to improve LLM-based automatic heuristic design, achieving better performance than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) in evolutionary computation suffers from static operators and lack of knowledge accumulation, limiting its effectiveness.

Method: Introduces HiFo-Prompt with two synergistic strategies: Foresight prompts adaptively steer search based on population dynamics, and Hindsight prompts distill successful heuristics into reusable design principles.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating higher-quality heuristics with faster convergence and superior query efficiency.

Conclusion: The dual Foresight-Hindsight mechanism successfully transforms transient discoveries into persistent knowledge, enabling LLMs to learn from their own experience in evolutionary computation.

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

*Ronit Virwani,Ruchika Suryawanshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOOP is a neuro-symbolic planning framework that enables iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components, achieving 85.8% success rate on IPC benchmarks compared to 55.0% for LLM+P.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains producing flawed plans, while classical planners lack flexibility and natural language understanding. Existing neuro-symbolic methods use one-shot translation missing collaborative refinement opportunities.

Method: LOOP treats planning as iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components, integrating 13 coordinated features including graph neural networks, multi-agent validation, hierarchical decomposition, and causal memory. It generates PDDL specifications and refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback.

Result: LOOP achieved 85.8% success rate on six standard IPC benchmark domains, significantly outperforming LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%).

Conclusion: The key to reliable planning is making neural networks and symbolic reasoners actually talk to each other throughout the entire process. LOOP provides a blueprint for building autonomous systems that can be trusted with critical real-world applications.

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

### [16] [SPANER: Shared Prompt Aligner for Multimodal Semantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13387)
*Thye Shan Ng,Caren Soyeon Han,Eun-Jung Holden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPANER is a modality-agnostic PEFT framework that uses shared prompts to embed diverse modalities into a unified semantic space, improving cross-modal generalization and few-shot retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal PEFT approaches focus on task-specific gains but neglect embedding space structure, leaving modality-specific representations isolated and limiting cross-modal generalization.

Method: SPANER employs a shared prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor to make semantically related instances converge spatially regardless of modality. The framework is extensible to support additional modalities without architectural changes.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual benchmarks show SPANER achieves competitive few-shot retrieval performance while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space.

Conclusion: Aligning embedding structures is more important than merely tuning adapter weights for scalable multimodal learning, and SPANER's shared prompt approach effectively enables unified semantic representation across modalities.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

*Nicole Cho,Kirsty Fielding,William Watson,Sumitra Ganesh,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TASER is an agentic table extraction system that handles messy, multi-page financial tables, outperforming existing models by 10.1% and achieving 9.8% more extracted holdings through continuous learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial documents contain essential information buried in messy, fragmented tables spanning multiple pages with complex structures (426 rows across 44 pages), requiring specialized extraction systems.

Method: TASER uses table agents for detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations leveraging an initial schema, with a Recommender Agent that reviews outputs and suggests schema revisions in a continuous learning process.

Result: Outperforms Table Transformer by 10.1%, larger batch sizes yield 104.3% increase in actionable schema recommendations and 9.8% increase in extracted holdings. Trained on 22,584 pages with $731B+ holdings data.

Conclusion: Agentic, schema-guided extraction systems show promise for robust understanding of real-world financial tables, with TASERTab dataset released to enable further research.

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

TL;DR: AI system autonomously conducts complete psychological research from hypothesis to manuscript without human intervention, demonstrating capability for scientific discovery but with limitations in theoretical interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of synthesizing knowledge across disciplines and developing unifying theories due to exponential growth of scientific literature and domain specialization, by exploring general-purpose AI systems for science.

Method: Domain-agnostic, agentic AI system that autonomously navigates the entire scientific workflow - hypothesis generation, data collection (online study with 288 participants), analysis pipeline development through extended coding sessions, and manuscript preparation for three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness.

Result: The AI system successfully designed and executed three psychological studies, collected new data, developed analysis pipelines, and produced completed manuscripts, demonstrating research capability with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigor comparable to experienced human researchers.

Conclusion: This represents a step toward embodied AI that can autonomously test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by exploring scientific spaces beyond human cognitive and resource constraints, while raising important questions about scientific understanding and credit attribution.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer-based models for spatio-temporal traffic forecasting struggle with rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion despite their strong global modeling capabilities, creating a need for more effective pattern-aware approaches.

Method: STPFormer integrates four key modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment, and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion.

Result: Experiments on five real-world datasets show that STPFormer consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability across different scenarios.

Conclusion: STPFormer demonstrates superior performance in spatio-temporal traffic forecasting through its unified and interpretable representation learning approach, effectively addressing the limitations of previous Transformer models in handling complex temporal patterns and spatial structures.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal
patterns, dynamic spatial structures, and diverse input formats. Although
Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with
rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a
Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art
performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It
integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware
temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial
learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment,
and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world

*Cheikh Ahmed,Mahdi Mostajabdaveh,Samin Aref,Zirui Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization problem for minimizing worst-case constraint violations, with a GPU-accelerated heuristic that achieves significant improvements across three applications: language model quantization, discrete tomography, and FIR filter design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address optimization problems with worst-case performance requirements through a context-free mathematical formulation that can be broadly applied to various domains requiring discrete value assignments while minimizing maximum constraint violations.

Method: Developed a GPU-accelerated heuristic that leverages mathematical properties of DMMV to speed up solution finding. The approach is applied to three use cases: post-training quantization of language models, discrete tomography reconstruction, and FIR filter design.

Result: Achieved 14% average improvement in quantization without outlier separation, 16% reduction in reconstruction error under uniform noise with 6x GPU acceleration for discrete tomography, and nearly 50% ripple reduction compared to commercial solver Gurobi for FIR filter design.

Conclusion: The DMMV formulation provides a versatile framework for worst-case optimization problems, and the GPU-accelerated heuristic offers substantial performance benefits across diverse applications, demonstrating the value of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization approach.

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

*Yuzhi Tang,Tianxiao Li,Elizabeth Li,Chris J. Maddison,Honghua Dong,Yangjun Ruan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LM agents show strong theoretical risk knowledge but fail to apply it in practice, with significant performance gaps between risk awareness and safety execution. A risk verifier system reduces risky actions by 55.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language model agents pose severe risks in safety-critical scenarios despite having theoretical risk knowledge, creating a dangerous gap between awareness and execution.

Method: Developed a comprehensive evaluation framework across three dimensions: risk knowledge, risk identification in trajectories, and actual safety behaviors. Created a risk verifier with abstractor to critique agent actions.

Result: Agents show >98% pass rates on risk knowledge but performance drops >23% in risk identification and <26% pass rates in actual safety execution. The risk verifier system reduces risky actions by 55.3%.

Conclusion: Scaling model capabilities alone doesn't resolve safety concerns. The proposed risk verification system effectively bridges the safety execution gap in LM agents.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

TL;DR: CrafterDojo introduces foundation models and tools to make Crafter a lightweight, prototyping-friendly alternative to Minecraft for embodied AI research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minecraft is too slow and complex for rapid prototyping, while Crafter lacks the foundation models needed for broad research applications.

Method: Developed CrafterVPT for behavior priors, CrafterCLIP for vision-language grounding, CrafterSteve-1 for instruction following, plus dataset generation tools and benchmark evaluations.

Result: Created a complete suite of foundation models and tools that enable Crafter to serve as an effective testbed for general-purpose embodied agents.

Conclusion: CrafterDojo successfully transforms Crafter into a viable lightweight alternative to Minecraft for rapid prototyping and research in embodied AI.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

TL;DR: EAG-RL is a two-stage training framework that enhances LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert attention guidance and reinforcement learning, achieving 14.62% average improvement on clinical prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally structured, high-dimensional data, and existing hybrid approaches fail to improve LLMs' intrinsic reasoning capacity.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Constructs stepwise reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to initialize LLM policy, 2) Optimizes policy via reinforcement learning by aligning LLM's attention with clinically salient features from expert EHR models.

Result: 14.62% average improvement in LLMs' EHR reasoning ability, enhanced robustness to feature perturbations, and better generalization to unseen clinical domains on two real-world EHR datasets.

Conclusion: EAG-RL demonstrates practical potential for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks by intrinsically enhancing LLMs' EHR reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been

TL;DR: MSRL (Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning) breaks through the SFT performance plateau in chart-to-code generation by using multimodal rewards and achieves significant improvements on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL has been effective for general reasoning but underexplored for tasks requiring deep understanding of information-rich images and structured outputs. SFT alone is insufficient for chart-to-code generation, highlighting the need for effective RL strategies.

Method: Proposed MSRL with multi-granularity structured reward system: rule-based rewards for textual code validation and model-based rewards for visual structural similarity assessment. Uses two-stage curriculum for training stability and largest training corpus of 3M real-world chart-code pairs.

Result: MSRL significantly breaks SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% on ChartMimic and 9.9% on ReachQA benchmarks, achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.

Conclusion: MSRL effectively addresses the limitations of SFT in structured output generation tasks and demonstrates the value of multimodal reinforcement learning for complex visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V2P method improves GUI element localization using suppression attention and Fitts' Law-inspired Gaussian heatmaps to address background distractions and center-edge distinction issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GUI localization methods neglect spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies, while current attention-based approaches suffer from background distractions and uniform labeling that fails to distinguish center vs edges of UI elements.

Method: Proposes Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method with suppression attention mechanism to minimize focus on irrelevant regions, and Fitts' Law-inspired 2D Gaussian heatmaps where weight decreases from center to edges based on target size.

Result: Achieves 92.3% on ScreenSpot-v2 and 50.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro benchmarks, with ablation studies confirming each component's contribution to performance.

Conclusion: V2P effectively isolates target areas and teaches models to focus on essential UI element points, demonstrating strong generalizability for precise GUI grounding tasks.

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

TL;DR: Neural Query Reranker (NQR) for answering queries with soft constraints over incomplete knowledge graphs, using interactive refinement with preference examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing query answering methods focus on first-order-logic queries but real-world queries often involve vague or context-dependent constraints like preferences for attributes or categories.

Method: Propose Neural Query Reranker (NQR) that adjusts query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints without disrupting original answers, operating interactively with incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred entities.

Result: Extended existing QA benchmarks with soft constraint datasets, demonstrating that NQR can capture soft constraints while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Conclusion: NQR effectively addresses the gap in handling soft constraints for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs through interactive refinement with preference examples.

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

*Rehan Raza,Guanjin Wang,Kevin Wong,Hamid Laga,Marco Fisichella*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ITL-LIME enhances LIME's explainability by using instance transfer learning with real source domain data instead of random perturbations, improving explanation fidelity and stability in data-scarce environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIME's randomness in perturbation and sampling causes locality and instability issues, especially with limited training data, leading to unrealistic variations and poor approximation of complex decision boundaries.

Method: Proposes ITL-LIME framework that uses clustering to partition source domain, retrieves relevant real source instances instead of random perturbations, employs contrastive learning-based encoder for weighting, and trains surrogate model with weighted instances.

Result: The method improves explanation fidelity and stability by leveraging real instances from related source domains and defining compact localities through intelligent weighting mechanisms.

Conclusion: ITL-LIME effectively addresses LIME's limitations in data-constrained environments by incorporating instance transfer learning and real data instances, providing more reliable and stable explanations for black-box models.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

*Mariam Arustashvili,Jörg Deigmöller,Heiko Paulheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Standard link prediction algorithms underperform on situational knowledge graphs for household actions, failing to beat simple baselines due to unique characteristics of this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge graphs for household actions are useful for controlling robots and analyzing video footage, but video-extracted information is often incomplete, requiring effective knowledge graph completion.

Method: The paper investigates standard link prediction approaches applied to situational knowledge graphs describing household activities, comparing their performance against simple baselines.

Result: Most standard link prediction algorithms were found unsuitable for situational knowledge graphs and unable to outperform even simple baseline methods.

Conclusion: Situational knowledge graphs have special characteristics that make conventional link prediction approaches ineffective, highlighting the need for specialized methods for this domain.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs are used for various purposes, including business
applications, biomedical analyses, or digital twins in industry 4.0. In this
paper, we investigate knowledge graphs describing household actions, which are
beneficial for controlling household robots and analyzing video footage. In the
latter case, the information extracted from videos is notoriously incomplete,
and completing the knowledge graph for enhancing the situational picture is
essential. In this paper, we show that, while a standard link prediction
problem, situational knowledge graphs have special characteristics that render
many link prediction algorithms not fit for the job, and unable to outperform
even simple baselines.

*Yu Li,Zulong Chen,Wenjian Xu,Hong Wen,Yipeng Yu,Man Lung Yiu,Yuyu Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MHSNet is a multi-level identity verification framework that uses fine-tuned BGE-M3 with contrastive learning and Mixture-of-Experts to detect duplicate resumes from third-party websites, addressing challenges of semantic complexity and information incompleteness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Third-party resumes from sites like LinkedIn and Indeed are often incomplete and inaccurate, making it difficult to maintain a quality talent pool. Duplication detection is essential but challenging due to semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness in resume texts.

Method: Proposes MHSNet framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. Uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to generate multi-level sparse and dense representations for resumes, enabling computation of multi-level semantic similarities. State-aware MoE handles diverse incomplete resumes.

Result: Experimental results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet in detecting duplicate resumes and improving resume quality.

Conclusion: MHSNet provides an effective solution for resume duplication detection, addressing the challenges of semantic complexity and information incompleteness in third-party resumes, thereby helping maintain and enrich company talent pools.

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

*Vincent Derkinderen,Robin Manhaeve,Rik Adriaensen,Lucas Van Praet,Lennert De Smet,Giuseppe Marra,Luc De Raedt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepLog is a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI that provides building blocks and primitives to abstract common representations and computational mechanisms. It consists of a language for specifying neurosymbolic models and extended algebraic circuits as computational graphs, forming a neurosymbolic abstract machine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework that can represent and emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems, abstracting away from specific logic types (boolean, fuzzy, probabilistic) and implementation details, making neurosymbolic AI more accessible and efficient.

Method: DeepLog uses two key components: 1) an annotated neural extension of grounded first-order logic as a specification language, and 2) extended algebraic circuits as computational graphs. The framework is implemented with GPU acceleration and supports different algebraic structures and logics declaratively.

Result: The framework demonstrates generality and efficiency through experimental comparisons showing performance differences between fuzzy vs probabilistic logics, architecture vs loss function logic usage, and CPU-based vs GPU-based implementations.

Conclusion: DeepLog provides a comprehensive neurosymbolic abstract machine that enables easy specification of diverse neurosymbolic models while achieving computational efficiency through GPU-accelerated algebraic circuits, making it a practical framework for neurosymbolic AI research and applications.

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

*Minh Hoang Nguyen,Van Dai Do,Dung Nguyen,Thin Nguyen,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalPlan framework integrates causal reasoning into LLM planning to reduce invalid actions and improve multi-agent coordination by learning causal graphs from trajectories and guiding action selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents, especially smaller open-source models, often produce causally invalid actions due to relying on surface-level correlations rather than grounded causal reasoning, which undermines their coordination and planning performance in dynamic environments.

Method: Two-phase framework with Structural Causal Action (SCA) model that learns causal graphs from agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and environment states influence future decisions, then uses this structure to guide action selection through causal scoring and reweighting.

Result: CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four LLMs of varying sizes, outperforming strong reinforcement learning baselines.

Conclusion: Embedding causal knowledge directly into the decision loop enables intervention-consistent behaviors without fine-tuning, highlighting the value of causality-driven planning for efficient, interpretable, and generalizable multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

### [33] [Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration for Medical Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13754)
*Liuxin Bao,Zhihao Peng,Xiaofei Zhou,Runmin Cong,Jiyong Zhang,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EMRC framework uses expertise-aware multi-LLM collaboration to improve medical decision-making accuracy by dynamically selecting optimal LLMs based on medical expertise and integrating responses through confidence fusion and adversarial validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single LLM approaches are limited by parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing to robustly integrate complex clinical information for medical decision-making.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) expertise-aware agent recruitment using LLM expertise table for dynamic selection of optimal LLMs, (2) confidence- and adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration with confidence fusion and adversarial validation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods on three public MDM datasets, achieving 74.45% accuracy on MMLU-Pro-Health (2.69% improvement over GPT-4-0613).

Conclusion: EMRC demonstrates effectiveness of expertise-aware agent recruitment and agent complementarity in leveraging specialized LLM capabilities for superior diagnostic performance in medical decision-making.

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

*Jan Jakubův,Mikoláš Janota*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel instantiation approach for SMT solvers that learns from existing techniques using probabilistic context-free grammars to generate new terms, balancing exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantified formulas are inherently undecidable and pose significant challenges for SMT solvers. Existing instantiation techniques often complement each other but lack a unified learning approach that can dynamically adapt and generate effective new instantiations.

Method: The method treats observed instantiations as samples from a latent language and uses probabilistic context-free grammars to generate new, similar terms. It can both mimic successful past instantiations and explore diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities.

Result: The approach provides a way to dynamically learn from various instantiation techniques during solving, enabling the generation of effective new terms that balance exploitation (using known successful patterns) and exploration (discovering new patterns).

Conclusion: This probabilistic grammar-based approach offers a novel way to handle quantified formulas in SMT solvers by learning from existing techniques and generating targeted instantiations that address the undecidability challenge through a balance of exploitation and exploration.

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

*Yifei Chen,Guanting Dong,Yutao Zhu,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive study on ensemble methods for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, addressing the limitation that single RAG frameworks cannot adapt well to diverse downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite various RAG frameworks emerging, no single framework performs optimally across all tasks. The authors aim to explore how to leverage multiple RAG systems through ensemble methods to achieve better performance and adaptability.

Method: The study analyzes RAG ensemble frameworks from theoretical (information entropy perspective) and mechanistic perspectives. They examine four pipeline types (Branching, Iterative, Loop, Agentic) and three module types (Generator, Retriever, Reranker) to answer seven research questions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that aggregating multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust at both pipeline and module levels, showing improved performance across different tasks.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for future research on multi-RAG system ensembles, providing theoretical explanations and practical frameworks for combining multiple RAG systems to achieve better task adaptation and performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

*Katharina Stein,Nils Hodel,Daniel Fišer,Jörg Hoffmann,Michael Katz,Alexander Koller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an improved approach for generating generalized plans using LLMs by adding pseudocode debugging, reflection steps, and program variant selection to enhance plan quality and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous LLM-based approaches for generating generalized PDDL plans directly implemented potentially flawed strategies, leading to incorrect plans. The authors aim to catch errors earlier in the process and improve overall plan quality.

Method: The approach generates strategies as pseudocode first for debugging, adds reflection steps to identify plan failures, and produces multiple program variants to select the best one, building on previous three-step framework.

Result: The extensions substantially improve generalized plan quality across 17 benchmark domains, with 12 domains achieving perfect solutions for all generated tasks, and never deteriorating performance.

Conclusion: Adding pseudocode debugging, reflection mechanisms, and program variant selection significantly enhances the reliability and effectiveness of LLM-generated generalized plans in PDDL domains.

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

TL;DR: TS-Agent is a modular agentic framework that automates time-series modeling for financial applications using LLMs, outperforming traditional AutoML with better accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series modeling in finance requires high performance, interpretability, and auditability, but current AutoML frameworks lack adaptability to domain-specific needs and evolving objectives.

Method: A modular agentic framework with three stages: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and experimental feedback using structured knowledge banks and curated libraries.

Result: Empirical evaluations show TS-Agent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines on financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks.

Conclusion: TS-Agent provides superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability while supporting adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing for high-stakes financial environments.

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

*Soumyadeep Dhar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents in supply chains can paradoxically perform worse than non-AI systems due to inventory hoarding, but combining high-level policy-setting with low-level collaborative execution creates stable AI-driven systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand emergent strategic behaviors of AI agents in economic settings, particularly in multi-echelon supply chains prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect.

Method: Computational experiments with generative AI agents (LLM-powered) in controlled supply chain simulations, testing collaborative AI agents designed with VMI principles against non-AI baselines.

Result: Discovered the 'collaboration paradox' where collaborative AI agents perform worse due to inventory hoarding. Found that resilience requires combining high-level AI policy-setting with low-level collaborative execution protocols.

Conclusion: The framework provides crucial insights into AI agent behaviors and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven business analytics systems through a two-layer synthesis approach.

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for refining large language models (LLMs) to serve as virtual assistants for PyChrono simulation software, improving their ability to generate simulation scripts and answer API questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether pretrained LLMs can be customized to help experts effectively use simulation tools like PyChrono by lowering the entry barrier and providing AI-assisted script generation.

Method: A framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs through a process that quantifiably improves the quality of generated PyChrono simulation scripts, ranging from simple to complex virtual experiments.

Result: The refined LLMs generate scripts that serve as strong starting points for users (though rarely perfect), can answer specific API questions, and recommend modeling approaches for the PyChrono simulator.

Conclusion: The framework is generalizable and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools in other application domains, demonstrating successful customization of LLMs as virtual assistants for expert simulation workflows.

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large
language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become
virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The longest run subsequence problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem from bioinformatics that plays a role in genome reassembly, requiring efficient computational solutions.

Method: Developed a BRKGA with focus on computational efficiency for evaluating individuals by converting vectors of gray values into valid solutions. Also implemented Max-Min Ant System and used CPLEX solver for comparison.

Result: The proposed BRKGA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for the LRS problem, though results indicate room for improvement particularly with large alphabet sizes.

Conclusion: BRKGA is currently the best technique for solving the longest run subsequence problem, but further optimization is needed especially for input strings with large alphabets.

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

Motivation: Address the mismatch between machine agents and human-centric desktop environments by unifying programmatic API calls with direct GUI interaction to enable skillful operation of complex digital workspaces.

Method: Developed a distributed RL infrastructure with thousands of parallel virtual desktop environments, and proposed Entropulse training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning to prevent entropy collapse.

Result: AutoGLM-OS-9B based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1% on OSWorld benchmark, demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop automation.

Conclusion: ComputerRL framework successfully enables scalable and robust training for desktop intelligence agents, with the algorithm and framework being adopted in building AutoGLM, showing practical applicability in real-world desktop automation systems.

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended

Conclusion: Provided valuable insights into the difficulty of plot question answering and the appropriateness of different model architectures for this problem.

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel multimodal sentiment analysis approach combining CNN image processing with LLM text analysis using GPT and prompt engineering, achieving 2.43% accuracy and 5.18% F1-score improvement on CrisisMMD dataset for disaster management applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve crisis management by better understanding public sentiment during natural disasters through enhanced multimodal analysis of social media data, addressing limitations of conventional separate modality processing methods.

Method: Integrated CNN-based image analysis with LLM-based text processing using GPT and prompt engineering, introduced contextual attention mechanism for intermodal relationship modeling, and deep neural network architecture for learning from fused features.

Result: Achieved significant 2.43% increase in accuracy and 5.18% improvement in F1-score compared to existing baselines, with enhanced classification of social media data into informative/noninformative categories across various natural disasters.

Conclusion: The approach provides deeper sentiment insights during crises and presents a promising direction for AI-driven crisis management solutions by bridging multimodal analysis, LLM-powered text understanding, and disaster response applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on
social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where
understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management.
Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately,
our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing,
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to
extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively
model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism
within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this
mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the
model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.
The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused
features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social
media data into informative and noninformative categories across various
natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and
5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal
data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into
the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to
real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize
the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal
analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work
presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis
management solutions. Keywords:

### [44] [Strategies for training point distributions in physics-informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13216)
*Santosh Humagain,Toni Schneidereit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of training point distribution strategies for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) solving differential equations, showing significant impact on solution accuracy connected to equation characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-informed neural networks show promise for solving differential equations but their performance depends on various factors, particularly the training point distribution which hasn't been systematically studied.

Method: Tested two ODEs and two PDEs with five training point generation strategies using shallow networks (1-2 hidden layers), including novel sine-based distributions inspired by Chebyshev nodes, with controlled weight initialization for reproducibility.

Result: Training point distributions significantly impact PINN solution accuracy, with evidence showing this impact is connected to the specific characteristics of each differential equation.

Conclusion: The choice of training point distribution is a critical factor in PINN performance and should be carefully considered based on the characteristics of the differential equation being solved.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential
equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a
loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily
added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered
as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after
the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as
a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from
numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large
variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a
core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test
two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for
training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two
hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based
training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.
The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,
random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results
show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy
and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the
differential equation.

Conclusion: The proposed self-attention communication module provides a differentiable, scalable solution for MARL communication that enables agents to learn effective message generation in a reward-driven manner.

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by
human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in
MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a
self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between
the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing
agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can
be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method

*Su Chen,Xiaohua Qi,Xixun Lin,Yanmin Shang,Xiaolin Xu,Yangxi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGNPP model combines graph neural networks with point processes to capture both network topology and temporal dynamics for temporal interaction networks, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches treated temporal interaction networks as coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problems, ignoring the important influence of network topology structure.

Method: Proposes Deep Graph Neural Point Process (DGNPP) with two modules: Node Aggregation Layer for static topological representations, and Self Attentive Layer for dynamic embedding updates over time. Combines both embeddings in event intensity function and optimizes via maximum likelihood estimation.

Result: Experimental evaluations on three public datasets show DGNPP achieves superior performance in both event prediction and time prediction tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: DGNPP effectively addresses limitations of prior approaches by incorporating both network topology structure and temporal dynamics, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities for temporal interaction networks.

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a
coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology
structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph
Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two
key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node
Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static
representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically
updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static
embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via
maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time
effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that
DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction
tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and
effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As student numbers increase, S-P charts become difficult to handle, requiring a method to classify large charts into smaller manageable ones.

Method: Simple clustering method based on recurrent neural network dynamics with multiple fixed points, where basins of attraction form clusters corresponding to smaller S-P charts.

Result: Effectiveness confirmed through fundamental experiments using average caution index to evaluate clustering performance and characterize student answer pattern singularity.

Conclusion: The proposed neural network-based clustering method effectively handles large S-P educational charts by creating smaller clusters through network dynamics.

Abstract: This paper studies an application of a recurrent neural network to clustering
method for the S-P chart: a binary data set used widely in education. As the
number of students increases, the S-P chart becomes hard to handle. In order to
classify the large chart into smaller charts, we present a simple clustering
method based on the network dynamics. In the method, the network has multiple

*Suhang Hu,Wei Hu,Yuhang Su,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RISE is a two-stage framework that generates high-quality reasoning chains for VLMs through reinforcement learning and self-supervised verification, outperforming standard fine-tuning methods in complex image annotation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with complex reasoning tasks like emotion classification and context-driven object detection. Standard SFT ignores rationales while Visual-RFT produces inconsistent reasoning chains due to lack of verified CoTs during pre-training.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) RISE-CoT uses reinforcement learning in an "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop to generate visually grounded CoTs by verifying reconstruction ability. 2) RISE-R1 filters high-quality CoTs for supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT on both complex and simple image annotation tasks, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability.

Conclusion: RISE provides a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs, enabling interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations in complex visual tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel method combines sparse regression and Lie derivatives to discover and feedback linearize physical system equations from prior dynamic behavior data


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discovering governing equations and designing effective feedback controllers for physical systems is challenging, especially with nonlinear dynamics. Existing approaches need better integration of system identification and control design.

Method: 1) Use sparse regression algorithm to identify system dynamics 2) Apply Lie derivatives to output function dictionary to derive augmented constraint 3) Design feedback controller that guarantees no internal dynamics are observed 4) Combine stacked regression with relative degree conditions

Result: Method successfully discovers and feedback linearizes true governing equations of physical models, overcoming limitations of prior works

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an effective framework for simultaneously identifying system dynamics and designing controllers that handle nonlinear factors through feedback linearization

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an
effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive
areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system
behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this
article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized
physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is
identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback
controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to
the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which
guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related
works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked
regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback
linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

*Nobuyuki Oishi,Philip Birch,Daniel Roggen,Paula Lago*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) using physics simulation to generate realistic sensor data, outperforming traditional signal transformation methods by improving F1 scores by 3.7 pp on average and reducing training data needs by up to 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and the physical implausibility of traditional signal transformation augmentation methods that may not preserve activity meaning.

Method: Leverages human body movement data from motion capture/video pose estimation and incorporates realistic variabilities through physics simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and hardware effects.

Result: PPDAs consistently outperform STDAs, improving macro F1 scores by average 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects across three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts.

Conclusion: Physics simulation-based PPDA provides a cost-effective and scalable solution to annotation scarcity in HAR, demonstrating significant advantages over traditional augmentation methods through physical plausibility.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across
real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this
issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal
Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used
in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially
resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the
activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize
Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.
PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose
estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics
simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and
hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional
STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,
we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to
their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can
reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects
used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving
macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive
performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first
systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the
advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the
potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement
Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and
scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in
HAR.

*Adrian Arnaiz-Rodriguez,Nina Corvelo Benz,Suhas Thejaswi,Nuria Oliver,Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A collaborative matching system (comatch) that selectively defers decisions to humans when uncertain, outperforming both human-only and algorithm-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithmic matching systems fail to achieve human-AI complementarity - decisions made by humans using algorithms aren't necessarily better than either alone.

Method: Proposed comatch system selects only decisions it's most confident in and defers the rest to human decision makers, optimizing the allocation to maximize performance.

Result: Large-scale study with 800 participants showed comatch outperformed both human participants and algorithmic matching alone in matching outcomes.

Conclusion: Collaborative matching approach successfully achieves human-AI complementarity by strategically combining algorithmic confidence with human decision making.

Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision
makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes
application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,
existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:
decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not
necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our
work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching
(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative
approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task
like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most
confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,
comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the
human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale
human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch
outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic
matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an
implementation of our system are available as open source at
https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.

*Floris den Hengst,Inès Blin,Majid Mohammadi,Syed Ihtesham Hussain Shah,Taraneh Younesian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical conformal classification (HCC) extends conformal prediction to incorporate class hierarchies, maintaining coverage guarantees while producing more structured and semantically meaningful prediction sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard conformal prediction treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels, which limits the usefulness of prediction sets.

Method: Formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem that yields prediction sets composed of nodes at different hierarchy levels. Show that a smaller, well-structured subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while maintaining optimality.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three benchmarks (audio, image, text data) shows advantages of HCC. User study demonstrates annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat prediction sets.

Conclusion: HCC successfully incorporates class hierarchies into conformal prediction, providing more meaningful prediction sets while preserving finite-sample coverage guarantees, making uncertainty quantification more useful for real-world applications.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample
coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction
set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high
probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP
treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as
semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper
presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that
incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of
prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose
solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the
hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial
nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured
subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding
optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of
audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a
user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat
prediction sets.

### [53] [Efficient Constraint-Aware Flow Matching via Randomized Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13316)
*Zhengyan Huan,Jacob Boerma,Li-Ping Liu,Shuchin Aeron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Constrained Flow Matching for generating samples that satisfy given constraints, with two approaches: differentiable distance penalty and oracle-based randomization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generate samples via Flow Matching while ensuring they satisfy specific constraints, addressing scenarios where constraints are either differentiable or only accessible through membership queries.

Method: Two approaches: (1) For differentiable constraints, add penalty term to FM objective; (2) For oracle-based constraints, use randomization to learn mean flow with high constraint satisfaction likelihood. Also proposes efficient two-stage approach.

Result: Numerical experiments show significant gains in constraint satisfaction while maintaining target distribution matching. Successfully applied to adversarial example generation using hard-label black-box classifier queries.

Conclusion: Proposed methods effectively handle constrained generation in both differentiable and oracle-based scenarios, with practical applications in adversarial training. Two-stage approach offers computational efficiency.

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an
additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given
constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable
distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint
set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we
propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that
penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.
For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is
numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This
approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex
constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to
constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show
that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow
but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is
more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained
generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve
significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target
distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show
how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,
using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several
future research directions. Our code is available at

### [54] [Decoding Communications with Partial Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13326)
*Dylan Cope,Peter McBurney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores machine language acquisition under partial observability, where learners must infer hidden information from environmental context, actions, and messages rather than having full access to all relevant information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional language acquisition models assume full observability, but real-world scenarios often involve partial information where learners need to infer hidden context from environmental cues and actions.

Method: The authors present a learning-based algorithm that decodes private information by analyzing environmental knowledge, actions taken, and messages sent, demonstrating the approach in toy settings and formally exploring challenges in general settings.

Result: The paper demonstrates that language acquisition can be achieved even under partial observability conditions by inferring hidden information from contextual clues and environmental interactions.

Conclusion: Partial observability presents a more realistic and challenging setting for language acquisition, and learning-based approaches can successfully decode private information to facilitate language learning in such environments.

Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation
learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner
observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and
situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed
is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant
information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a
more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from
knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see
several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved
in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general
settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding
of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel fMRI classification framework using dynamic graph creation and spatio-temporal attention mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis, outperforming static approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI classification methods rely on static functional connectivity and fail to comprehensively capture spatio-temporal relationships in neural activity dynamics, which is crucial for neuroscience.

Method: Dynamically infers functional brain connectivity using transformer-based attention mechanisms, constructs time-varying graphs processed with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and transformers to capture both localized interactions and global temporal dependencies.

Result: Achieves 63.2% accuracy and 60.0 AUC on ABIDE dataset subset, significantly outperforming static graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN: 51.8%).

Conclusion: Validates the efficacy of joint modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI classification, with core novelty in attention-driven dynamic graph creation and hierarchical spatio-temporal feature fusion.

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the
development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI
classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or
cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new
framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in
this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time
interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to
selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing
time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized
interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE
dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static
graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint
modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI
classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph
creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical
spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-MoE is a novel training system that enables scalable training of large MoE models (up to 545B parameters) on non-NVIDIA platforms by addressing memory overhead, communication costs, and platform-specific optimization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE training systems have significant limitations including substantial activation memory overhead, costly all-to-all communication, and suboptimal performance on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving computational potential untapped.

Method: X-MoE uses several novel techniques: efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with sequence-sharded MoE blocks.

Result: On the Frontier supercomputer with AMD MI250X GPUs, X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to 545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than existing methods under the same hardware budget while maintaining high training throughput.

Conclusion: X-MoE successfully addresses the scalability limitations of current MoE training systems, enabling efficient training of extremely large MoE models on non-NVIDIA hardware platforms with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for counterfactual prediction rely on point estimates or purely data-driven models that fail under data scarcity, creating a need for more robust approaches that incorporate expert knowledge.

Method: A time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals as structured priors for generative modeling, bridging mechanistic and data-driven approaches.

Result: ODE-Diff consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and distributional accuracy across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations, synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables more reliable and interpretable causal inference by effectively combining expert knowledge with data-driven modeling, addressing limitations of existing methods in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Predicting counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems is
essential for scientific modeling and decision-making in domains such as public
health and medicine. However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or
purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose
a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from
imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured
priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and
data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal
inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations,
synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating
that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and
distributional accuracy.

*Ruipu Li,Daniel Menacho,Alexander Rodríguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A conformal prediction framework for calibrating trajectory ensembles to produce prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory ensembles from probabilistic models or multiple predictors are commonly uncalibrated despite reflecting inherent uncertainty in domains like autonomous driving and forecasting

Method: Proposes a unified conformal prediction framework with novel online update step and optimization step that captures inter-step dependencies to produce discontinuous prediction intervals around trajectories

Result: The method produces calibrated prediction intervals that naturally capture temporal dependencies and yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates

Conclusion: The framework successfully transforms uncalibrated trajectory samples into calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical guarantees while maintaining temporal dependencies and adaptive uncertainty estimation

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous
driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners
commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging
multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent
uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework
based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into
calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By
introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures
inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction
intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and
yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

*Seohyeon Cha,Kevin Chan,Gustavo de Veciana,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: J3O framework jointly optimizes model deployment (onloading) and query routing (offloading) for multi-task edge inference, achieving near-optimal accuracy with significantly reduced runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world edge applications require concurrent execution of multiple AI tasks, but existing frameworks only handle single-task scenarios, creating a need for unified multi-task optimization under resource constraints.

Method: Formulated as mixed-integer program, J3O uses alternating algorithm with greedy model selection via Lagrangian-relaxed submodular optimization and optimal offloading via constrained linear programming, extended for edge batching.

Result: J3O achieves over 97% of optimal accuracy while requiring less than 15% of the runtime compared to optimal solver across multi-task benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed J3O framework effectively addresses multi-task edge inference challenges, providing near-optimal performance with practical computational efficiency for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge
devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that
distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While
most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many
real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)
require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,
segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified
framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at
clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy
(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and
communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and
introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating
algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed
submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained
linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,
maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O
consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less
than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task
benchmarks.

TL;DR: Chirp-based time-frequency analysis with LOF outlier detection and weighted spatial metrics effectively localizes seizure onset zones, showing high concordance in successful surgical cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a quantitative framework for evaluating spatial concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones and statistically anomalous channels identified through chirp event analysis, providing a complementary method for SOZ localization.

Method: Two-step methodology: (1) Unsupervised Outlier Detection using Local Outlier Factor analysis with adaptive neighborhood selection on spectro-temporal features of chirp events; (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis computing exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity incorporating hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity.

Result: LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects outliers. Index matching weighted by channel proximity outperformed exact matching. Highest performance in seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), while failure cases showed lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460).

Conclusion: Chirp-based outlier detection combined with weighted spatial metrics provides a valuable complementary method for SOZ localization, particularly effective in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial
concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and
statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of
chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)
Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with
adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on
spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and
temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both
exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating
hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that
the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects
outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming
exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those
with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas
failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The
key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted
spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,
particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's limited understanding of how standard language modeling practices (textual representations, tokenization, model size, dataset scale) impact molecular generation performance, despite Mol-LLMs emerging as scalable approaches for exploring billions of molecules.

Method: Introduces NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5 billion molecules, with systematic investigation of textual representations, tokenization strategies, model size, and dataset scale effects.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and goal-directed molecular generation tasks. Identifies weak correlation between pretraining metrics and downstream performance.

Conclusion: Provides a robust foundation for advancing efficient molecular modeling strategies, revealing important distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics that inform future model development.

Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient
exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$
possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have
been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations,
Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have
emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules.
However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language
modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies,
model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this
work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing
NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5
billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical
analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured
during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important
distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen
establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior
Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and
goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation
for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

*Chuyun Deng,Huiwen Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Network-aware contextual bandit algorithms that enable adaptive information sharing across networked agents, reducing learning complexity from O(N) to sublinear O(√N) while maintaining lighter communication costs than fully centralized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in contextual bandits for networked environments where information is partially shared, as classical approaches assume either fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners without considering structural similarities and local differences across networked locations.

Method: Developed two network-aware UCB algorithms: NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which decompose learning into global and local components using dynamically updated network weights. Agents share computed summaries of homogeneous features rather than full synchronization.

Result: Established regret bounds showing reduction in learning complexity from O(N) to sublinear O(√N). NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance contexts. Demonstrated effectiveness in simulated pricing environments.

Conclusion: The proposed network-aware algorithms provide efficient solutions for contextual bandits over networks, enabling adaptive information sharing that balances global structure learning with local adaptation while maintaining practical communication efficiency.

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential
decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple
locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also
exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either
fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored
in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,
we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information
sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose
learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to
benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms
incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as
agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We
establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity
associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$,
where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary
strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained
heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance
contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across
simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

*Jeremy Carleton,Debajoy Mukherjee,Srinivas Shakkottai,Dileep Kalathil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAVIS enables dynamic multi-objective alignment of LLMs at inference time using small value models and value-guided search, avoiding expensive per-objective fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need to balance conflicting objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness, but current fine-tuning approaches are computationally expensive and inflexible for handling diverse user preferences.

Method: Trains small value models for each objective, combines them with user-specified weights at inference time to create a tilting function that adjusts the base model's output distribution through KL-regularized policy optimization.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods that fine-tune per-objective models and combine them post hoc, approaching performance of models fine-tuned for exact user preferences.

Conclusion: MAVIS provides a lightweight, flexible framework for dynamic multi-objective alignment without modifying base model weights, offering computational efficiency and adaptability to diverse user preferences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives --
such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific
preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning
models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally
expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via
Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment
framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the
base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each
corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models
are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that
adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The
value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures
monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that
MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine
them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting
where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

### [65] [EventTSF: Event-Aware Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13434)
*Yunfeng Ge,Ming Jin,Yiji Zhao,Hongyan Li,Bo Du,Chang Xu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EventTSF is a novel autoregressive diffusion framework that integrates textual events with time series data to improve non-stationary forecasting by addressing multimodal synchronization challenges and event-induced uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series forecasting approaches rely on single modalities, limiting contextual knowledge and performance. There's a need to incorporate natural language-based external events to better capture non-stationary dynamics in domains like energy and transportation.

Method: EventTSF uses autoregressive diffusion with flow matching, adaptively controlling timesteps based on event semantic signals. It employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer to fuse temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.

Result: Extensive experiments on 8 datasets show EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines with 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and 1.13x faster training efficiency across diverse event-aware non-stationary forecasting scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses multimodal synchronization challenges and demonstrates significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and efficiency by effectively integrating textual events with time series data.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy
and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with
events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural
language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains
largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,
resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling
fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is
challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained
synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous
time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual
semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and
multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges
by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),
an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series
with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses
autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced
temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching
timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The
underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that
efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.
Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF
outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series
forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher
forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

TL;DR: SVDformer combines SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware graph representation learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on directed graph node classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing directed graph neural networks struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural patterns due to isotropic aggregation and localized filtering mechanisms.

Method: SVDformer refines singular value embeddings through multi-head self-attention for adaptive graph filtering, and uses Transformer to model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns while preserving edge directionality.

Result: Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks show SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks.

Conclusion: SVDformer establishes a new paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs by synergizing SVD and Transformer architecture for effective direction-aware representation learning.

Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in
real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often
struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural
patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering
mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel
framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware
graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value
embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical
spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables
learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral
kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection
bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to
model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through
attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during
feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks
demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and
direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in hierarchical multi-label classification including maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in multi-task learning, which suffers from "one-strong-many-weak" optimization bias.

Method: Proposes HCAL classifier with prototype contrastive learning, adaptive task-weighting mechanisms, and prototype perturbation. Uses semantic consistency modeling with label and feature aggregation from child to parent classes, and introduces Hierarchical Violation Rate metric.

Result: Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate higher classification accuracy and reduced hierarchical violation rate compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed HCAL classifier effectively addresses structural consistency and optimization bias issues in hierarchical multi-label classification through its integrated prototype learning and adaptive weighting approach.

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from
failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases,
and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector

TL;DR: DyMixOp is a novel neural operator framework that transforms infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into finite-dimensional latent space using inertial manifold theory and Local-Global-Mixing transformation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with up to 86.7% error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of transforming nonlinear PDE systems into suitable formats for neural network approximation, particularly for non-linearizable dynamics and infinite-dimensional spaces.

Method: Uses inertial manifold theory to create finite-dimensional latent space, incorporates Local-Global-Mixing transformation inspired by convection dynamics, and employs dynamics-informed architecture with multiple LGM layers to capture both linear and nonlinear dynamics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse PDE benchmarks with significant error reduction (up to 86.7% in convection-dominated scenarios) while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: DyMixOp provides an effective framework for approximating nonlinear PDE dynamics by combining theoretical foundations from inertial manifold theory with innovative architectural components, offering improved accuracy and physical interpretability.

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear
dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with
non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for
linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework
for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address
this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms
infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent
space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear
interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the
Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in
turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details
and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in
existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a
dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate

*Jixian Li,Timbwaoga Aime Judicael Ouermi,Mengjiao Han,Chris R. Johnson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces uncertainty tube visualization for neural network particle trajectory predictions, combining uncertainty quantification methods with superelliptical tubes to represent nonsymmetric uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks predict particle trajectories well but lack effective uncertainty visualization, compromising reliability in trust-critical applications.

Method: Develops superelliptical uncertainty tube visualization integrated with Deep Ensembles, MC Dropout, and SWAG uncertainty quantification techniques.

Result: Demonstrates practical utility on synthetic and simulation datasets with computationally efficient uncertainty representation.

Conclusion: Uncertainty tube provides intuitive visualization of nonsymmetric uncertainty in NN predictions, enhancing reliability assessment.

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially
enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively
quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains
challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN
models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly
compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel,
computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this
uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and
implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and
intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established
uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo
Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we
demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its
application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.

### [73] [Explainability of Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13529)
*Andrés Páez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines two types of AI opacity - technical complexity and intentional concealment - and explores explainable AI methods to address technical opaqueness, while noting ongoing challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the different forms of algorithmic opacity in AI systems and their ethical implications, as opaqueness is a major obstacle to ethical AI development.

Method: The paper analyzes two types of opacity: 1) technical complexity (inherent black-box nature of complex algorithms like neural networks), and 2) intentional concealment for proprietary reasons. It then examines explanatory methods developed in computer science to address technical opaqueness.

Result: The analysis reveals that explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges in making complex AI systems transparent and understandable to human stakeholders.

Conclusion: While technical complexity creates inherent opacity in many AI systems, intentional concealment adds another layer of opaqueness. Current XAI methods have limitations and significant challenges remain in achieving truly explainable and transparent AI systems.

Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned
as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial
intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly
complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes
of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,
rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,
including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their
stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical
complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from
view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision
systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part
of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the
ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we
explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer
science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows,
explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

### [74] [MuFlex: A Scalable, Physics-based Platform for Multi-Building Flexibility Analysis and Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13532)
*Ziyan Wu,Ivan Korolija,Rui Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuFlex is an open-source platform for benchmarking multi-building control strategies that enables synchronous EnergyPlus simulations with standardized RL interfaces, demonstrating effective demand flexibility coordination across buildings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing building control testbeds are limited to single buildings or use simplified models that cannot capture physical intricacies and intermediate variables needed for proper control performance interpretation. Most platforms also impose fixed formats that restrict benchmarking across diverse scenarios.

Method: Developed MuFlex - a scalable open-source platform that enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to the latest OpenAI Gym interface for modular, standardized RL implementation. Demonstrated using Soft Actor-Critic algorithm with fine-tuned hyperparameters.

Result: Coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings successfully reduced total peak demand below specified thresholds while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

Conclusion: MuFlex addresses critical gaps in multi-building control benchmarking by providing a physically detailed, standardized platform that enables effective coordination of building flexibility for grid balancing with renewable energy integration.

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid,
maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from
aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored
for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation
testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly
benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target
single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically
rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven
approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies
and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.
Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model
formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse
control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source
platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building
flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables
synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres
to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL
implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study
coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results
show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand
below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

*Rituparna Datta,Jiaming Cui,Gregory R. Madden,Anil Vullikanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALYPSO is a hybrid framework combining neural networks with mechanistic epidemic models to forecast MRSA spread across healthcare settings, improving accuracy by 4.5% over baselines while providing interpretable predictions and policy analysis capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRSA poses a critical public health threat in healthcare facilities. Existing forecasting models lack epidemiological interpretability and have limited performance, while mechanistic models are difficult to calibrate and integrate diverse datasets.

Method: Hybrid framework integrating neural networks with mechanistic metapopulation models using patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters for MRSA spread.

Result: CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5% compared to machine learning baselines, enables accurate forecasts at multiple spatial resolutions, and identifies high-risk regions and cost-effective infection prevention strategies.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach provides both accurate forecasting and epidemiological interpretability, supporting effective counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and resource allocation for MRSA prevention.

Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public
health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better
understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA
rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on
statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological
interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are
difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We
present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with
mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious
diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model
leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare
transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA
spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial
resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports
counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We
also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5%
compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk
regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention
resources.

### [76] [Collapsing ROC approach for risk prediction research on both common and rare variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13552)
*Changshuai Wei,Qing Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CROC method combining common and rare genetic variants for improved disease risk prediction accuracy compared to common variants alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current genetic risk prediction models based only on common variants lack sufficient accuracy for clinical use, while rare variants remain understudied.

Method: Developed collapsing receiver operating characteristic (CROC) approach extending forward ROC (FROC) with procedures for handling rare variants, tested on 533 SNPs from 37 genes.

Result: CROC model with all SNPs achieved AUC=0.605 vs 0.585 for common variants only. CROC outperformed FROC especially when common variants decreased, reaching AUC=0.603 vs 0.524 with only rare variants.

Conclusion: Comprehensive risk prediction incorporating both common and rare variants through CROC method significantly improves predictive accuracy over common variant-only approaches.

Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great
promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk
prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common
genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked
sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome
have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease
prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction
strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are
proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk
prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an
extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional
procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the
use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the
Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction
model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on
common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two
approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.
We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when
the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,
when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of
0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

TL;DR: GenHAI is a novel generative probabilistic model for predicting MRSA infection outcomes in hospitalized patients using probabilistic programming to answer predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRSA is a serious antimicrobial resistance threat with high risk for hospitalized patients due to co-morbid conditions, immunosuppression, antibiotic use, and contact with contaminated hospital environments.

Method: Developed a generative probabilistic model based on probabilistic programming paradigm to model sequences of MRSA test results during hospitalizations.

Result: The model demonstrated efficacy when compared against discriminative and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GenHAI provides hospital administrators with a tool to answer important questions for mitigating MRSA infection risks through predictive, causal, and counterfactual analysis.

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial
resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening
consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to
a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno
suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital
workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative
probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results
outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used
to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital
administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based
on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately
answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative
and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

### [78] [A Generalized Learning Framework for Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13596)
*Lingyu Si,Jingyao Wang,Wenwen Qiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) that unifies self-supervised contrastive learning methods and introduces Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to improve feature space properties without labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize and unify existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods under a common framework, and address the challenge of designing effective constraints without label information.

Method: Proposes GLF with aligning and constraining parts, analyzes BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV under this framework, and introduces ADC method to iteratively capture sample relationships and calibrate distributions for better intra-class compactness and inter-class separability.

Result: Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation demonstrate that ADC achieves superior performance in preserving class information in the feature space without using labels.

Conclusion: The GLF framework successfully unifies existing SSCL methods, and ADC provides an effective plug-and-play solution for improving feature space properties in self-supervised learning settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated
superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the
standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of
two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three
existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be
unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further
propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into
designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class
information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is
challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To
address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and
inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship
between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called
Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or
far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further
away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis
and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

Motivation: Scale large models through quantized/low-precision arithmetics while maintaining probabilistic inference capabilities and model interpretability.

Method: Perform probabilistic inference in quantized discrete parameter spaces using probabilistic circuits for both 2D densities and quantized neural networks.

Result: Validated with various models showing inference efficiency without accuracy loss, providing clear insights into model behavior.

Conclusion: Advances scalable, interpretable machine learning by enabling discrete approximations for probabilistic computations in quantized parameter spaces.

Abstract: The machine learning community has recently put effort into quantized or

probabilistic inference in the quantized, discrete parameter space created by
these representations, effectively enabling us to learn a continuous

quantized neural networks, where we introduce a tractable learning approach
using probabilistic circuits. This method offers a scalable solution to manage
complex distributions and provides clear insights into model behavior. We
validate our approach with various models, demonstrating inference efficiency
without sacrificing accuracy. This work advances scalable, interpretable

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic comparison of partial identification methods for causal inference, including new extensions and empirical evaluation across diverse scenarios, with practical guidance and open-source implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial identification offers principled causal inference without strong assumptions but remains underutilized due to fragmented methods and lack of practical guidance.

Method: Implemented, extended, and unified state-of-the-art bounding algorithms (symbolic, optimization-based, information-theoretic) within common framework; extended entropy-bounded method for counterfactual queries; conducted thousands of randomized simulations with discrete/continuous data.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of methods on bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness; developed practical decision tree for algorithm selection and ML model to predict best method based on data characteristics.

Conclusion: Provides systematic framework and practical tools to make partial identification more accessible and applicable, with open-source Python package (CausalBoundingEngine) for implementation and comparison.

Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured
confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice.
Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on
unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives
bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its
theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied
work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of
practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically
comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal
scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including
symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a
common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a
recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to
counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency
(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving
both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method
in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to
assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a
practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning
model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data
characteristics.
  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,
CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods
through a unified interface.

TL;DR: FedOL enables one-shot federated learning using knowledge distillation instead of parameter sharing, allowing heterogeneous models while reducing communication overhead by transmitting predictions instead of weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FL requires uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which neglects resource heterogeneity, imposes heavy computational demands on clients, and increases communication overhead.

Method: Uses knowledge distillation where clients exchange model predictions on unlabeled public data instead of model parameters. Introduces specialized objective function to refine pseudo-labels and server model iteratively, with tailored pseudo-label generation and knowledge distillation strategy.

Result: Simulation results show FedOL significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering cost-effective solution for mobile networks with private data but limited computational resources.

Conclusion: FedOL provides efficient one-shot federated learning that handles client heterogeneity, reduces communication overhead, and maintains privacy while achieving superior performance compared to traditional FL approaches.

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even
without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample
computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy
constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated
Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared
model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it
requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which
neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,
and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot
settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter
sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange
model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces
communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full
model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model
architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may
be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth
labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate
these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that
iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning
reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label
generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates
diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms
existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks
where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational
resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural network weight generation approaches struggle with generalization to unseen tasks and lack practical application exploration, creating a gap between textual semantics and weight-space dynamics.

Method: Hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates CLIP text embeddings via prior attention mechanism, and employs adversarial training with weight-space augmentation.

Result: Outperforms optimization-based initialization on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet, enables weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion, and demonstrates high-quality weight generation for unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Bridges textual semantics with weight-space dynamics, advances practicality of generative models in neural network parameter synthesis, and provides open-source dataset of text-weight pairs.

Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While
neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle
with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To
address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates
task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W
hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates
text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs
adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization.
Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability
to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming
optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as
weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual
semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of
text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural
network parameter synthesis. Our code is available on Github.

*Zhuang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Automatic learning rate adjustment based on stochastic gradient variations without manual hyperparameter tuning


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning rate regimes are complex and require manual tuning of additional hyperparameters, leading to high computational costs and inefficiency in practice

Method: Developed an explainable learning rate regime using stochastic second-order algorithms that automatically adjusts learning rate based on the norm of stochastic gradients - increases when gradient norm decreases, decreases when gradient norm increases

Result: The proposed automatic learning rate regime demonstrates efficiency, robustness, and scalability across different stochastic algorithms (SGD, SGDM, SIGNSGD) on various machine learning tasks

Conclusion: The method provides a natural and direct approach to automatic learning rate adjustment that eliminates manual parameter tuning while maintaining performance across different optimization algorithms

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted
and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to
tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include
huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a
natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically
only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An
explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is
developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented
simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic
procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic
gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,
robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,
containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance variation across clients in personalized subgraph FL due to heterogeneous local data distributions remains a key challenge that needs to be addressed.

Method: Leverages sheaf collaboration mechanism to embed client subgraphs into server-constructed collaboration graph using graph-level embeddings, then employs sheaf diffusion to enrich client representations and generates customized models via server-optimized hypernetwork.

Result: Outperforms existing personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets, exhibits fast model convergence, and effectively generalizes to new clients.

Conclusion: FedSheafHN successfully addresses client heterogeneity in subgraph FL through its sheaf collaboration and hypernetwork approach, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph
federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a
local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for
each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance
variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local
subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework
built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors
with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds
each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by
leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the
collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN
generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing
personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it
exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

TL;DR: GRAFT is an efficient in-training subset selection method that reduces computational costs and environmental impact by selecting diverse, representative examples from low-rank feature subspaces instead of training on full batches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally intensive and environmentally costly due to high energy consumption and CO2 emissions. There's a need for methods that can reduce these costs while maintaining model performance.

Method: GRAFT uses a three-step approach: (1) extracts low-rank feature representations for each batch, (2) applies Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small diverse subset spanning the batch's dominant subspace, and (3) dynamically adjusts subset size using gradient-approximation criterion.

Result: GRAFT matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency across multiple benchmarks, while significantly reducing wall-clock time, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions.

Conclusion: GRAFT provides a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and environmental impact, making it a scalable solution for reducing the computational and environmental costs of neural network training.

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset
selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each
batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset
that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the
subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank
subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches,
GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy
consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT
matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency,
providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

### [86] [Input Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13654)
*Rapheal Huang,Weilong Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Input Time Scaling paradigm that refines queries using meta-knowledge from LLMs, challenging the 'garbage in, garbage out' principle by showing that seemingly low-quality data can achieve high performance when properly processed during both training and testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs rely on data/training scaling and inference time scaling, but there's an untapped opportunity to improve performance by optimizing inputs (queries) using meta-knowledge from LLMs during both training and testing phases.

Method: Proposes Input Time Scaling that combines meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. Requires co-design approach where query strategies must be applied during both training and testing phases for optimal performance.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance among 32B models: 76.7% on AIME24 and AIME25 pass@1, and up to 86.7% on AIME24 with majority voting. Contradicts conventional wisdom by showing that adding irrelevant information and using minimally filtered datasets can perform best.

Conclusion: Input Time Scaling complements existing scaling methods. Challenges the 'garbage in, garbage out' principle and shows that careful input refinement using meta-knowledge can achieve superior results with less data, supporting the 'Less is More' phenomenon in LLM training.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with

*Amir Rezaei Balef,Katharina Eggensperger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends CASH framework to modern ML pipelines with PS-PFN method using posterior sampling and PFNs for efficient adaptation of pre-trained models, showing superior performance over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AutoML systems focus on hyperparameter optimization but modern ML workflows require fine-tuning, ensembling, and adaptation techniques for pre-trained models, demanding novel approaches to handle heterogeneous pipelines.

Method: Proposes PS-PFN that extends Posterior Sampling to max k-armed bandit problem, leveraging prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) for efficient posterior distribution estimation via in-context learning, with extensions for varying costs and individual arm modeling.

Result: Experimental results on one novel and two existing benchmark tasks demonstrate superior performance compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies.

Conclusion: PS-PFN effectively extends CASH framework to handle modern ML pipeline adaptation, providing an efficient solution for selecting and adapting heterogeneous ML workflows with pre-trained models.

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been
fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of
pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization
and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.
While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a
downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands
novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and
adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit
adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed
bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to
efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via
in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying
costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions
individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing
standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN
compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

*Canzhe Zhao,Shinji Ito,Shuai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First framework for adversarial heavy-tailed bandits using FTRL with bonus functions, achieving best-of-both-worlds results for MABs and linear bandits with finite arms, plus a general HT-SPM learning rate for BOBW guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused almost exclusively on stochastic heavy-tailed bandits, with limited exceptions only for multi-armed bandits. There was a gap in adversarial heavy-tailed bandit problems, particularly for linear settings.

Method: Propose FTRL framework with bonus function shifting loss estimates. Develop HT-SPM (heavy-tailed noise aware stability-penalty matching) learning rate. Use variance-reduced linear loss estimator for linear bandits.

Result: First FTRL-type BOBW algorithm for heavy-tailed MABs with O~(T^{1/ε}) adversarial regret and O~(log T) stochastic regret. First algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed linear bandits with O~(d^{1/2}T^{1/ε}) regret matching stochastic bounds. First BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear bandits.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses adversarial heavy-tailed bandits, providing the first comprehensive solutions for both MABs and linear bandits with finite arms, achieving best-of-both-worlds performance without truncated non-negativity assumptions.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of
\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,
enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed
noises, have recently attracted significant attention
\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.
However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few
exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
(MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed
bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the
loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus
function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm
for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity
assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$
worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log
T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework
to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed
linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the
best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose
a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware
stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW
regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions
are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear
loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear
bandits.

TL;DR: Novel data-driven heuristic combining machine learning with problem-specific characteristics for single-machine scheduling to minimize total weight of tardy jobs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing exact algorithms for single-machine scheduling perform well on typical instances but deteriorate on certain problem regions, while data-driven approaches offer scalable performance when tailored to specific datasets.

Method: Combines machine learning with problem-specific characteristics to ensure feasible solutions, with systematic exploration of ML models and detailed model selection process.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and adaptability across varied data scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates strong flexibility for practical applications and provides insights into optimal model selection for scheduling problems.

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact
algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly
deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven
approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the
structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a
single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight,
duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy
jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines
machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible
solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and
adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for
practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML
models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model
selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best
fit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns, information silos, class imbalance, Non-IID data distribution, and lack of model interpretability in supply chain credit assessment systems.

Method: Performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS) for faster convergence, FedProx architecture with homomorphic encryption, transformer encoder for feature insights, and integrated gradient XAI technique for decision transparency.

Result: Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets show Trans-XFed delivers accurate credit assessments while maintaining transparency and privacy, outperforming several baseline methods.

Conclusion: Trans-XFed successfully integrates federated learning with explainable AI to provide accurate, privacy-preserving, and interpretable credit assessment for supply chains, addressing multiple key challenges in the domain.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Trans-XFed architecture that combines federated
learning with explainable AI techniques for supply chain credit assessment. The
proposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,
information silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently
distributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit
assessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS)
to tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster
convergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores. The FedProx
architecture, enhanced with homomorphic encryption, is used as the core model,
and further incorporates a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder block
provides insights into the learned features. Additionally, we employ the
integrated gradient explainable AI technique to offer insights into
decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans-XFed through
experimental evaluations on real-world supply chain datasets. The obtained
results show its ability to deliver accurate credit assessments compared to
several baselines, while maintaining transparency and privacy.

*Noël Kury,Dmitry Kobak,Sebastian Damrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DREAMS is a novel dimensionality reduction method that combines t-SNE's local structure preservation with PCA's global structure preservation through regularization, creating embeddings that balance both aspects across multiple scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dimensionality reduction methods excel at either preserving local structure (like t-SNE) or global structure (like PCA), but no established method can effectively represent both aspects simultaneously for comprehensive data visualization.

Method: DREAMS combines t-SNE's local structure preservation with PCA's global structure preservation via a simple regularization term, generating a spectrum of embeddings that bridge between these two extremes.

Result: Benchmarked across seven real-world datasets (including single-cell transcriptomics and population genetics), DREAMS demonstrated superior qualitative and quantitative performance in preserving structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: DREAMS successfully addresses the limitation of existing methods by providing a unified approach that preserves both local and global structure in dimensionality reduction, offering enhanced visualization capabilities for high-dimensional data analysis.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing
high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically
designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS,
PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent
both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction
Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure
preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a
simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings
between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally
well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global
structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets,
including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population
genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to
preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thompson Sampling algorithm for Sharpe ratio maximization in bandit setting achieves logarithmic regret with optimal performance bounds


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharpe ratio optimization introduces tradeoff between high returns and risk control, unlike conventional cumulative reward maximization, requiring careful exploration of both mean and variance

Method: Proposed SRTS algorithm based on Thompson Sampling with Gaussian reward assumption, featuring novel regret decomposition for Sharpe ratio optimization

Result: Established logarithmic regret upper bound with matching lower bound showing order-optimality, significantly outperforms existing algorithms in empirical simulations

Conclusion: Thompson Sampling is effective for Sharpe ratio maximization with theoretical guarantees and superior empirical performance compared to existing methods

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for
Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the
Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its
empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of
Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives
focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead
introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling
risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical
contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for
the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the
reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish
fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in
terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and
show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves
logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the
difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical
simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
algorithms.

*Zhicheng Yang,Zhijiang Guo,Yinya Huang,Yongxin Wang,Dongchun Xie,Yiwei Wang,Xiaodan Liang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR's potential is limited by depth and breadth constraints. DARS addresses depth neglect by reweighting hard problems, while large-breadth training enhances performance. DARS-B combines both for optimal results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR approaches suffer from systematic bias where cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights medium-accuracy samples while neglecting low-accuracy instances crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries.

Method: Introduced Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS) to reweight hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts. Also explored large-breadth training with full-batch updates over multiple epochs instead of PPO's mini-batch iterations.

Result: DARS delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost. Large-breadth training significantly enhances Pass@1 performance and sustains high token-level entropy. DARS-B shows simultaneous gains in both Pass@K and Pass@1.

Conclusion: Breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, both being crucial for unleashing the full reasoning power of reinforcement learning with verifiable reward.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language
models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:
Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances
consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and
reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights
samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances
that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth
neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which
re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby
increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,
naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts
Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra
inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of
exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training
data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch
size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over
multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.
Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued
exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which
augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K
and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across
depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the
reasoning power of RLVR.

TL;DR: PENGUIN introduces a novel attention mechanism with periodic-nested relative attention bias and grouped multi-query attention to effectively capture multiple periodic patterns in time series, outperforming both MLP and Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Transformers' success in various domains, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains questionable. The paper aims to address the limitations of self-attention in capturing periodic patterns in time series data.

Method: Proposes Periodic-Nested Group Attention (PENGUIN) with explicit periodic pattern modeling through periodic-nested relative attention bias and a grouped attention mechanism where each group targets specific periodicities using multi-query attention.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models in long-term time series forecasting.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that explicitly modeling periodic patterns through specialized attention mechanisms is crucial for effective time series forecasting, and PENGUIN provides a simple yet effective solution that surpasses existing approaches.

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with
wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made
significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series
forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of
self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested
Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of
explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias
for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested
relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle
multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a
grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity
using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and
Transformer-based models.

TL;DR: ISP is an adaptive mechanism that dynamically selects the optimal number of clients per round in federated learning to improve communication efficiency by up to 30% without sacrificing model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces communication bottlenecks, especially with heterogeneous and dynamic client participation. Existing methods don't adequately address how to choose the optimal number of clients per training round.

Method: Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP) - an adaptive mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Consistent communication savings of up to 30% across diverse setups including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and training with gradient compression, without losing final model quality.

Conclusion: Selecting the optimal number of clients per round is a crucial separate task in federated learning that significantly impacts communication efficiency while preserving model performance.

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across
domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling
decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key
bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client
participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other
approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate
communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in
a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent
Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically
determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication
efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness
of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG
classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show
consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final
quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups
highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of
federated learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset-level trustworthiness properties (like fairness and bias) has become critical, but prior work only evaluated individual data trustworthiness, not emergent dataset-level properties.

Method: Built on Subjective Logic to support trust propositions and quantify uncertainty in scenarios with incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting evidence. Framework instantiated for bias evaluation using traffic sign recognition dataset.

Result: Method successfully captures class imbalance and remains interpretable and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

Conclusion: The framework provides the first formal approach for uncertainty-aware assessment of dataset-level trustworthiness properties, addressing critical needs in AI training data evaluation.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset
trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness
or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic
to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate
trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a
whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the
trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations
of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach
supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where
evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this
framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally
evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results
demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced distribution learning is a significant challenge that reduces predictive modeling performance, with most existing approaches focused on classification rather than regression problems.

Method: Proposes using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model data distributions and develop a data generation method that combines disentangled VAE with smoothed bootstrap applied in the latent space.

Result: Method evaluated through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark datasets for Imbalanced Regression (IR).

Conclusion: The approach addresses the critical problem of imbalanced regression by creating an innovative data generation technique that overcomes VAE inefficiency with imbalanced data.

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in
predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms.
Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to
classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper
introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the
Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose
using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent
representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with
imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an
innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a
Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of
this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark
datasets for IR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic comparison shows one-shot pruning better at low ratios, iterative pruning superior at high ratios, leading to proposed hybrid approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous empirical comparison between one-shot and iterative pruning methods, challenging the assumed superiority of iterative pruning without systematic testing.

Method: Comprehensive benchmarking across structured/unstructured settings with different pruning criteria and modalities, comparing one-shot vs iterative pruning approaches.

Result: Each method has specific advantages: one-shot pruning more effective at lower pruning ratios, iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios.

Conclusion: Advocates for patience-based pruning and introduces hybrid approach that can outperform traditional methods, providing practical guidance for pruning strategy selection.

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve
computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways:
one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and
iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for
potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has
historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather
than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and
comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,
benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying
different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has
specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning
ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on
these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid
approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,
providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy
tailored to their goals and constraints. Source code is available at

### [100] [FedUP: Efficient Pruning-based Federated Unlearning for Model Poisoning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13853)
*Nicolò Romandini,Cristian Borcea,Rebecca Montanari,Luca Foschini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedUP is a lightweight federated unlearning algorithm that efficiently removes malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections in the model using only the last round's weights, achieving effective unlearning while being faster and more storage-efficient than state-of-the-art solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, and traditional Federated Unlearning assumes trusted clients. However, with malicious and potentially colluding clients who won't cooperate in unlearning, a new approach is needed to selectively remove malicious influence without complete retraining.

Method: FedUP prunes specific connections by zeroing the highest magnitude weights that show the greatest divergence between benign and malicious clients' latest updates. It uses only weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify which connections to inhibit, carefully preserving benign information.

Result: FedUP effectively reduces malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match a model retrained from scratch while maintaining performance on benign data. It works under strong adversarial conditions (up to 50% malicious clients with full knowledge) across IID and Non-IID data, handling label-flipping and backdoor attacks.

Conclusion: FedUP provides an efficient, robust solution for federated unlearning with malicious clients, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods in speed and storage efficiency while effectively mitigating malicious influence without requiring complete model retraining.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model
poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the
global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address
such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected
malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.
However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,
applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging
because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This
work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently
mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within
the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on
clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify
which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due
to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this
by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge
the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while
preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial
threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full
knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,
robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and
Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it
with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces
malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a
model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP
achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving
storage compared to the SOTA.

TL;DR: This paper presents an updated framework for evaluating biometric modalities through expert surveys, revealing significant shifts in property ratings compared to the outdated 1998 framework and showing strong alignment with empirical dataset analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing 1998 evaluation framework for biometric modalities is outdated and doesn't account for recent technological developments and emerging vulnerabilities in biometric systems, necessitating a modern assessment approach.

Method: Conducted an expert survey with 24 biometric specialists to evaluate biometric modalities, analyzed expert agreement levels, and compared expert assessments with dataset-level uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets.

Result: Substantial shifts in property ratings across modalities - face recognition improved due to technological progress, fingerprint reliability decreased due to emerging vulnerabilities. Strong alignment found between expert assessments and empirical dataset evidence.

Conclusion: The expert survey provides reliable and updated biometric modality evaluations, identifies key open challenges through expert disagreements, and demonstrates the importance of integrating expert insight with empirical evidence for guiding future research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

### [102] [Fisher-Orthogonal Projection Methods for Natural Gradient Descent with Large Batches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13898)
*Yishun Lu,Wesley Armour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOP enables effective second-order optimization at very large batch sizes by constructing variance-aware update directions using orthogonal gradient projections under the Fisher metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimizers struggle with very large batch sizes - first-order methods lose escape ability from suboptimal minima due to reduced gradient noise, while second-order methods require excessive damping that washes out curvature information.

Method: Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP) leverages gradients from two sub-batches to enhance the average gradient with an orthogonal component of the gradient difference under the Fisher-metric, creating variance-aware update directions.

Result: FOP restores second-order method effectiveness at very large batch sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster convergence.

Conclusion: FOP provides a novel solution to overcome the limitations of both first-order and second-order optimizers when dealing with extremely large batch sizes on modern GPU hardware.

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,
enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of
training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform
effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise
decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of
first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global
minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high
damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively
washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,
reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,
we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that
restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch
sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster
convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging
gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component
of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the
Fisher-metric.

*Thanh Nguyen,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OFQL enables efficient one-step action generation in offline RL using Flow Matching, eliminating multi-step denoising requirements of Diffusion Q-Learning while achieving better performance and faster training/inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) achieves strong offline RL performance but suffers from practical limitations due to multi-step denoising requirements during training and inference, which is computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL) that reformulates DQL within the Flow Matching framework, learning an average velocity field for direct one-step action generation without auxiliary models or distillation.

Result: OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based baselines on D4RL benchmark while substantially reducing both training and inference time compared to DQL.

Conclusion: OFQL provides an efficient alternative to diffusion-based RL methods by enabling one-step generation through Flow Matching, achieving superior performance with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled
high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning
(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among
them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its
consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice
due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both
training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply
applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we
revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow
Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action
generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary
models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates
DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While
conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step
generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates
direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for
multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster
and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL
benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based
baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time
compared to DQL.

*Tianheng Ling,Vipin Singh,Chao Qian,Felix Biessmann,Gregor Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Edge-based AI forecasting framework for sewer overflow prediction using quantized Transformer and LSTM models on FPGA hardware, achieving energy-efficient local inference without cloud dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change intensifies extreme weather events, challenging aging sewer systems with overflow risks. Cloud-based AI solutions are unreliable during communication outages, necessitating local edge computing solutions.

Method: Lightweight Transformer and LSTM models compressed via integer-only quantization, deployed on AMD Spartan-7 FPGA through automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline that optimizes for both prediction error and energy consumption.

Result: 8-bit Transformer achieved MSE 0.0376 at 0.370 mJ per inference, while 8-bit LSTM required only 0.009 mJ (40x lower energy) but with 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE 0.0432) and longer training time.

Conclusion: Framework enables local, energy-efficient sewer overflow forecasting, with trade-off between LSTM (ultra-low energy) and Transformer (higher accuracy), contributing to more resilient sewer systems.

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge
aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater
overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can
provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating
uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have
offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their
reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication
outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that
enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution
integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,
compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.
Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for
optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy
consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer
data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical
measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ
per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly
less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE
0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to
align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low
energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,
our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more
resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub
Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).

*SM Mazharul Islam,Manfred Huber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Categorical Policies for multimodal behavior in continuous control RL, using latent categorical distributions to enable structured exploration and outperform standard Gaussian policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Gaussian policies in deep RL are unimodal, limiting exploration and adaptation in complex environments with sparse rewards, requiring multimodal policies for robust behavior.

Method: Uses categorical distributions as intermediate latent variables to select behavior modes, with differentiable sampling schemes that maintain gradient-based optimization while enabling multimodality.

Result: Outperforms standard Gaussian policies on DeepMind Control Suite environments, achieving faster convergence and better performance through improved exploration capabilities.

Conclusion: Categorical distributions provide an effective tool for structured exploration and multimodal behavior representation in continuous control tasks, enhancing RL policy learning.

Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or
stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone,
limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many
practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates
robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges
arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic
adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control
domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted
optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling
process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical
Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical
distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the
sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable
discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based
optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the
behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining
fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy
on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through
better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform
standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical
distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and
multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

*Bastian Schäfer,Lennart Purucker,Maciej Janowski,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Survey of 53 automated feature engineering methods reveals they are generally hard to use, lack documentation, have no active communities, and lack essential constraints like time and memory limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular data is ubiquitous in machine learning, and feature engineering is crucial for peak performance. Manual feature engineering is expensive, so automation is needed, but existing AutoFE methods haven't been evaluated for practical usability.

Method: Investigated 53 existing automated feature engineering (AutoFE) methods to assess their usability, documentation, community support, and constraint capabilities.

Result: Found that AutoFE methods are generally difficult to use, poorly documented, lack active communities, and critically missing time and memory constraint settings that are essential for practical deployment.

Conclusion: There is a significant need for future development of usable, well-engineered AutoFE methods that address the practical constraints and usability requirements of real-world applications.

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various
machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features
can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such
feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine
learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a
substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated
feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding
their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We
found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and
have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and
memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our
survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE
methods.

*Mohammad Izadi,Mehran Safayani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASDFormer is a Transformer-based model with Mixture of Experts that achieves state-of-the-art ASD diagnosis accuracy and identifies functional connectivity biomarkers from fMRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASD involves disrupted brain connectivity patterns that fMRI can detect. Current methods need improvement in capturing community-level connectivity alterations and identifying biomarkers for better diagnosis.

Method: Transformer architecture with Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) that uses attention mechanisms to adaptively focus on relevant brain regions and connectivity patterns from fMRI ROI data.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy on ABIDE dataset and identified robust functional connectivity disruptions associated with ASD, enabling interpretable biomarker discovery.

Conclusion: ASDFormer shows strong potential as both a diagnostic tool and biomarker discovery platform for autism spectrum disorder through its ability to capture neural signatures and provide interpretable insights.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can
be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped
into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.
Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these
communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively
capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical
development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker
discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based
architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to
capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple
specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively
emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to
autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more
interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the
ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and
reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD,
highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSP problems are fundamental in Reinforcement Learning as they can represent various cost-criteria, but existing algorithms may lack convergence guarantees or optimal performance.

Method: Developed two tabular algorithms and one function approximation algorithm specifically designed for Stochastic Shortest Path problems with theoretical convergence properties.

Result: All algorithms demonstrate asymptotic almost-sure convergence. Tabular algorithms outperform other convergent RL algorithms, and the function approximation algorithm shows reliable performance compared to alternatives.

Abstract: In this paper we propose two algorithms in the tabular setting and an
algorithm for the function approximation setting for the Stochastic Shortest
Path (SSP) problem. SSP problems form an important class of problems in
Reinforcement Learning (RL), as other types of cost-criteria in RL can be
formulated in the setting of SSP. We show asymptotic almost-sure convergence
for all our algorithms. We observe superior performance of our tabular
algorithms compared to other well-known convergent RL algorithms. We further
observe reliable performance of our function approximation algorithm compared
to other algorithms in the function approximation setting.

TL;DR: Efficient knowledge graph unlearning algorithm using Taylor expansion and Fisher matrices to approximate parameter changes without expensive derivative computations, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for machine unlearning due to regulations like Right to be Forgotten, with KG unlearning being particularly challenging due to KG structure and semantic relations between entities.

Method: Define influence function for KG unlearning, use Taylor expansion to estimate parameter changes, approximate inverse-Hessian vector product using Fisher matrices and zeroth-order optimization without constructing computational graphs.

Result: Outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning baselines significantly in both unlearning efficiency and quality.

Conclusion: Proposed method provides an efficient and effective solution for knowledge graph unlearning that avoids expensive computational overhead while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand
for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining
is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this
paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning
algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive
structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning
by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant
computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this
end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to
approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of
first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,
we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data
removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives
dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order
optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without
constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning
baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning
quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

TL;DR: AutoScale is a two-phase framework that uses multi-task optimization metrics to automatically select optimal weights for linear scalarization, achieving superior performance without expensive hyperparameter search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear scalarization with well-chosen fixed task weights can match complex MTO methods, but it's unclear why certain weights work best and how to determine them efficiently without exhaustive search.

Method: Establishes connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods, identifies that optimal weights show specific trends in MTO metrics (like high gradient magnitude similarity), and introduces AutoScale - a two-phase framework using these metrics to guide weight selection.

Result: AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across diverse datasets, including a new large-scale benchmark, without requiring expensive weight search.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that MTO metrics can effectively guide weight selection for linear scalarization, providing a simple yet powerful alternative to complex MTO methods with automated weight optimization.

Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when
using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better
performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains
unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine
these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper
establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods,
revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization
weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient
magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a
simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide
weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search.

*Jiho Park,Huiwen Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model for online advertising with multiple simultaneous user interactions, featuring two algorithms with improved regret bounds compared to classical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address realistic online advertising scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items simultaneously, overcoming limitations of classical contextual bandits that don't capture cascading feedback, parallel context sessions, and heterogeneous rewards.

Method: Proposed two algorithms: UCBBP (Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning) and AUCBBP (Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning). UCBBP is a UCB-style algorithm tailored for the new framework, while AUCBBP is designed for efficiency improvement in context/user scaling.

Result: UCBBP achieves regret bound of O~(√THN) over T episodes, H session steps, and N contexts per episode. AUCBBP shows strict efficiency improvement with regret bound of O~(√T+HN), demonstrating better scaling with number of users/contexts. Both algorithms validated through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit framework and algorithms effectively capture realistic advertising scenarios with multiple simultaneous users, providing theoretically sound and empirically validated solutions with improved regret bounds compared to classical approaches.

Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new
combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising
scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items
simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key
structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure,
(ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii)
heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with
Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and
prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$
episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the
fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a
second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning
(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,
user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate
our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

Conclusion: KMR offers both conceptual and practical tools for unifying and advancing model efficiency research, providing foundations for automated policy learning, dynamic adaptation, and theoretical analysis of cost-quality trade-offs.

Abstract: We introduce the Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR) framework, a unified formalism for

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel quantization method using differentiable STE with learnable parameters achieves competitive accuracy even at extreme W1A1 quantization while maintaining training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization reduces neural network capacity as bit-width decreases, creating bottlenecks. The paper aims to track capacity dynamics and optimize quantization through differentiable fine-tuning.

Method: Uses fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator with learnable bit-width, noise scale, and clamp bounds. Enforces target bit-width via exterior-point penalty and stabilizes training with metric smoothing through distillation.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy down to extreme W1A1 quantization setting while retaining the efficiency benefits of STE-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed differentiable quantization framework effectively manages capacity reduction during quantization and achieves strong performance even at very low bit-widths with simple and efficient training.

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where
rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the
floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity
dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization
bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization
problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator
(STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a
target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via
distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains
competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the
efficiency of STE.

TL;DR: A new typed topological space framework for analyzing 2D datasets using typed open sets to reveal inner structures like tracks, components, and pseudotrees, enabling algorithms for convex hull, clustering, and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dataset analysis focuses on statistical and algebraic topological methods; this work introduces a typed topology approach from general topology perspective to study finite topological spaces like datasets.

Method: Develops a special set of types and related typed topology on 2D datasets, organizing data into tracks and components with ordering, represented by integer sequences and pseudotree structures.

Result: The framework reveals inner dataset structures including ordered components within tracks, branches crossing tracks, and typed-II pseudotrees that represent relationships between components.

Conclusion: The typed topological approach provides a platform for developing new algorithms for computational geometry problems including convex hull calculation, hole detection, clustering, and anomaly detection.

Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a
dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method
\cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was
introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological
spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology
perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets
are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using
open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types
and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate
the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,
in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.
Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer
sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be
well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such
structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as
calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

TL;DR: BLIPs is a Bayesian framework for MLIPs that provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and improved accuracy, especially in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLIPs struggle with out-of-distribution data and data-scarce regimes, and lack built-in uncertainty estimates needed for active learning and accuracy verification.

Method: Scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian framework using adaptive Variational Dropout, compatible with equivariant message-passing architectures.

Result: Improved predictive accuracy over standard MLIPs, trustworthy uncertainty estimates, minimal computational overhead, and consistent gains when fine-tuning pretrained models.

Conclusion: BLIPs successfully addresses MLIP limitations by providing calibrated uncertainties and better performance in challenging data scenarios.

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool
in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs
struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when
trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based
chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by
construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to
ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To
address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic
Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian
framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of
Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and
minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference
time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing
architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry
tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs,
and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy
out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP
yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

TL;DR: LEOPARD is a new algorithm that learns reward functions from both preference feedback and expert demonstrations, outperforming existing methods when limited human feedback is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning often struggles with complex tasks where specifying good reward functions is difficult. Existing approaches using both preferences and demonstrations are often ad-hoc, domain-specific, or don't scale well.

Method: Developed a new framing called 'reward-rational partial orderings over observations' and introduced LEOPARD algorithm that can learn from various data types including negative demonstrations to efficiently learn reward functions.

Conclusion: LEOPARD provides a flexible and scalable approach for learning from human data, demonstrating that combining different types of feedback (preferences and demonstrations) leads to better performance in reward learning across diverse domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential
settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when
the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert
demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both
together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.
We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational
partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.
Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated
Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a
broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn
reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited
amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD
outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use
LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a
single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.

### [117] [Goal-Directedness is in the Eye of the Beholder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13247)
*Nina Rajcic,Anders Søgaard*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Goal-directedness cannot be objectively measured in agent systems due to technical and conceptual problems with both behavioral and mechanistic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations of current approaches for attributing goals to complex agents and identify problems with formalizing goal-directedness.

Method: Analyzing the assumptions behind behavioral and mechanistic approaches to goal attribution, identifying technical and conceptual problems with formalizing goals in agent systems.

Result: Goal-directedness cannot be measured objectively through either behavioral observation or internal model state probing.

Conclusion: Goal-directedness should be modeled as an emergent property of dynamic, multi-agent systems rather than measured objectively.

Abstract: Our ability to predict the behavior of complex agents turns on the
attribution of goals. Probing for goal-directed behavior comes in two flavors:
Behavioral and mechanistic. The former proposes that goal-directedness can be
estimated through behavioral observation, whereas the latter attempts to probe
for goals in internal model states. We work through the assumptions behind both
approaches, identifying technical and conceptual problems that arise from
formalizing goals in agent systems. We arrive at the perhaps surprising
position that goal-directedness cannot be measured objectively. We outline new
directions for modeling goal-directedness as an emergent property of dynamic,
multi-agent systems.

### [118] [Self-Organizing Agent Network for LLM-based Workflow Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13732)
*Yiming Xiong,Jian Wang,Bing Li,Yuhan Zhu,Yuqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: SOAN is a structure-driven orchestration framework that builds formalized agent networks by identifying and encapsulating structural units as independent agents to handle complex multi-layer nested enterprise workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world enterprise workflows involve complex modularization and reuse of subprocesses, creating lengthy and deeply nested execution paths that challenge LLM-driven orchestration due to extended reasoning chains and state-space explosions.

Method: Proposes Self-Organizing Agent Network (SOAN) that incrementally builds formalized agent networks by identifying and encapsulating structural units as independent agents to enhance modularity and clarity.

Result: Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks and real-world enterprise workflow datasets show SOAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adaptability, fault tolerance, and execution efficiency.

Conclusion: SOAN provides an effective solution for handling complex multi-layer nested workflows in enterprise environments through structure-driven orchestration with formalized agent networks.

Abstract: Recent multi-agent frameworks built upon large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex task planning. However, in
real-world enterprise environments, business workflows are typically composed
through modularization and reuse of numerous subprocesses, resulting in
intricate workflows characterized by lengthy and deeply nested execution paths.
Such complexity poses significant challenges for LLM-driven orchestration, as
extended reasoning chains and state-space explosions severely impact planning
effectiveness and the proper sequencing of tool invocations. Therefore,
developing an orchestration method with controllable structures capable of
handling multi-layer nesting becomes a critical issue. To address this, we
propose a novel structure-driven orchestration framework Self-Organizing Agent
Network (SOAN). SOAN incrementally builds a formalized agent network by
identifying and encapsulating structural units as independent agents, enhancing
modularity and clarity in orchestration. Extensive evaluations were performed
using multiple benchmarks as well as a real-world enterprise workflow dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that SOAN significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, fault tolerance, and
execution efficiency.

*Zihan Guo,Yuanjian Zhou,Chenyi Wang,Linlin You,Minjie Bian,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: BetaWeb proposes a blockchain-based trustworthy infrastructure for LLM-based multi-agent systems (LaMAS) to address privacy, data management, and value measurement challenges in current fragmented agent ecosystems, enabling scalable cross-domain autonomous interactions and advancing towards Web3.5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic ecosystems are fragmented and closed, with existing centralized/semi-centralized paradigms unable to support large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain autonomous interactions due to privacy protection, data management, and value measurement challenges.

Method: Introduces BetaWeb - a blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic Web framework that leverages blockchain's inherent strengths to provide scalable infrastructure for LaMAS, with a five-stage evolutionary roadmap from passive execution to advanced collaboration and autonomous governance.

Result: BetaWeb offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure that can advance Web paradigm from Web3 (data ownership) to Web3.5 (agent capability ownership and intelligence monetization), laying foundation for resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized digital ecosystem.

Conclusion: Deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS through BetaWeb can establish interconnected and scalable paradigm for Agentic AI, overcoming limitations of current approaches and enabling large-scale autonomous interactions with proper privacy, data management, and value measurement mechanisms.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled the development of artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are
increasingly evolving into diverse autonomous entities, advancing the LLM-based
multi-agent systems (LaMAS). However, current agentic ecosystems remain
fragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for
Agentic AI has become a critical prerequisite. Although Agentic Web proposes an
open architecture to break the ecosystem barriers, its implementation still
faces core challenges such as privacy protection, data management, and value
measurement. Existing centralized or semi-centralized paradigms suffer from
inherent limitations, making them inadequate for supporting large-scale,
heterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions. To address these
challenges, this paper introduces the blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic
Web (BetaWeb). By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain, BetaWeb not
only offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for LaMAS but also has
the potential to advance the Web paradigm from Web3 (centered on data
ownership) towards Web3.5, which emphasizes ownership of agent capabilities and
the monetization of intelligence. Beyond a systematic examination of the
BetaWeb framework, this paper presents a five-stage evolutionary roadmap,
outlining the path of LaMAS from passive execution to advanced collaboration
and autonomous governance. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing
products and discuss key challenges of BetaWeb from multiple perspectives.
Ultimately, we argue that deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS can lay
the foundation for a resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized
digital ecosystem. A summary of the enabling technologies for each stage is
available at https://github.com/MatZaharia/BetaWeb.

*Churong Liang,Jinling Gan,Kairan Hong,Qiushi Tian,Zongze Wu,Runnan Li*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: COCO framework introduces continuous oversight for multi-agent workflows with O(1) monitoring overhead, achieving 6.5% performance improvement through error detection and correction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale multi-agent workflows are vulnerable to error propagation and quality degradation without corrective mechanisms for upstream failures.

Method: Decoupled architecture with three innovations: Contextual Rollback Mechanism, Bidirectional Reflection Protocol, and Heterogeneous Cross-Validation for error detection and correction.

Result: 6.5% average performance improvement on benchmark multi-agent tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art for autonomous workflow reliability.

Conclusion: COCO provides a theoretically-grounded framework for continuous oversight in multi-agent systems, effectively addressing error propagation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large-scale multi-agent workflows exhibit inherent vulnerability to error
propagation and quality degradation, where downstream agents compound upstream
failures without corrective mechanisms. We introduce COCO (Cognitive Operating
System with Continuous Oversight), a theoretically-grounded framework that
implements asynchronous self-monitoring and adaptive error correction in
multi-agent driven systems. COCO addresses the fundamental trade-off between
quality assurance and computational efficiency through a novel decoupled
architecture that separates error detection from the critical execution path,
achieving $O(1)$ monitoring overhead relative to workflow complexity. COCO
employs three key algorithmic innovations to address systematic and stochastic
errors: (1) Contextual Rollback Mechanism - a stateful restart protocol that
preserves execution history and error diagnostics, enabling informed
re-computation rather than naive retry; (2) Bidirectional Reflection Protocol -
a mutual validation system between monitoring and execution modules that
prevents oscillatory behavior and ensures convergence; (3) Heterogeneous
Cross-Validation - leveraging model diversity to detect systematic biases and
hallucinations through ensemble disagreement metrics. Extensive experiments on
benchmark multi-agent tasks demonstrate 6.5\% average performance improvement,
establishing new state-of-the-art for autonomous workflow reliability.

### [121] [The Multi-Stage Assignment Problem: A Fairness Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13856)
*Vibulan J,Swapnil Dhamal,Shweta Jain*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper addresses fair path assignment in multi-stage graphs, showing that cost-minimizing assignments can be highly unfair. It proves NP-hardness of envy minimization, proposes C-Balance algorithm with bounded envy and cost of fairness guarantees, extends to n agents with DC-Balance, and demonstrates significant speed advantages over ILP approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional efficient assignments that minimize total cost in multi-stage graphs can create significant cost disparities (envy) among agents, leading to unfair outcomes. There's a need for algorithms that provide fair path assignments while maintaining reasonable efficiency.

Method: Proposed C-Balance algorithm for two agents that guarantees envy bounded by 2M (max edge weight) and cost of fairness bounded by 2. Extended to n agents with DC-Balance algorithm that makes iterative calls to C-Balance, achieving envy arbitrarily close to 2M.

Result: Proved NP-hardness of envy-minimizing assignment. C-Balance provides tight envy bound of 2M for two agents. DC-Balance achieves near-optimal envy for n agents. Both algorithms show bounded cost of fairness. Experimental results show orders of magnitude faster performance than ILP formulations.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms effectively address the fairness-efficiency tradeoff in multi-stage graph assignments, providing provable envy bounds and reasonable cost efficiency while being computationally practical compared to exact optimization methods.

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of fair assignment on Multi-Stage graphs. A
multi-stage graph consists of nodes partitioned into $K$ disjoint sets (stages)
structured as a sequence of weighted bipartite graphs formed across adjacent
stages. The goal is to assign node-disjoint paths to $n$ agents starting from
the first stage and ending in the last stage. We show that an efficient
assignment that minimizes the overall sum of costs of all the agents' paths may
be highly unfair and lead to significant cost disparities (envy) among the
agents. We further show that finding an envy-minimizing assignment on a
multi-stage graph is NP-hard. We propose the C-Balance algorithm, which
guarantees envy that is bounded by $2M$ in the case of two agents, where $M$ is
the maximum edge weight. We demonstrate the algorithm's tightness by presenting
an instance where the envy is $2M$. We further show that the cost of fairness
($CoF$), defined as the ratio of the cost of the assignment given by the fair
algorithm to that of the minimum cost assignment, is bounded by $2$ for
C-Balance. We then extend this approach to $n$ agents by proposing the
DC-Balance algorithm that makes iterative calls to C-Balance. We show the
convergence of DC-Balance, resulting in envy that is arbitrarily close to $2M$.
We derive $CoF$ bounds for DC-Balance and provide insights about its dependency
on the instance-specific parameters and the desired degree of envy. We
experimentally show that our algorithm runs several orders of magnitude faster
than a suitably formulated ILP.
