### [1] [Rethinking Multi-Agent Intelligence Through the Lens of Small-World Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18094)
*Boxuan Wang,Zhuoyun Li,Xiaowei Huang,Yi Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Small-world networks improve multi-agent systems by balancing local clustering and long-range connections, enhancing stability and scalability while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based multi-agent systems lack structural guidance, using overly simplistic or ad-hoc topologies without leveraging proven network theories.

Method: Applied small-world network theory to multi-agent systems, tested with multi-agent debate, and introduced uncertainty-guided rewiring for adaptive connectivity.

Result: Small-world connectivity achieved similar accuracy and token efficiency as other topologies while substantially improving consensus stability and enabling scalable adaptation.

Conclusion: Small-world networks serve as effective design priors for LLM-based multi-agent systems, providing stability, robustness, scalability, and cognitive role emergence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent systems (MAS) in which multiple agents argue, critique, and coordinate to solve complex tasks, making communication topology a first-class design choice. Yet most existing LLM-based MAS either adopt fully connected graphs, simple sparse rings, or ad-hoc dynamic selection, with little structural guidance. In this work, we revisit classic theory on small-world (SW) networks and ask: what changes if we treat SW connectivity as a design prior for MAS? We first bridge insights from neuroscience and complex networks to MAS, highlighting how SW structures balance local clustering and long-range integration. Using multi-agent debate (MAD) as a controlled testbed, experiment results show that SW connectivity yields nearly the same accuracy and token cost, while substantially stabilizing consensus trajectories. Building on this, we introduce an uncertainty-guided rewiring scheme for scaling MAS, where long-range shortcuts are added between epistemically divergent agents using LLM-oriented uncertainty signals (e.g., semantic entropy). This yields controllable SW structures that adapt to task difficulty and agent heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss broader implications of SW priors for MAS design, framing them as stabilizers of reasoning, enhancers of robustness, scalable coordinators, and inductive biases for emergent cognitive roles.

Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) inference can suffer from dense inter-agent communication and low hardware utilization, which jointly inflate serving latency. We present a serving design that targets these bottlenecks through an algorithm-system co-design. First, we replace dense agent interaction graphs with a hierarchical tree topology that induces structured sparsity in inter-agent communication. Second, we introduce a runtime adaptive mechanism that selectively terminates or skips downstream agent invocations using semantic agreement and confidence signals from intermediate outputs. Third, we pipeline agent execution by overlapping incremental prefilling with decoding across dependency-related agents, improving utilization and reducing inference latency. Across representative tasks, this approach substantially reduces end-to-end latency (up to 90%) while maintaining comparable accuracy (within $\pm$1%) relative to dense-connectivity MoA baselines, and can improve accuracy in certain settings.

### [3] [Conflict-Driven Clause Learning with VSIDS Heuristics for Discrete Facility Layout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18034)
*Joshua Gibson,Kapil Dhakal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CDCL with VSIDS is applied to facility layout problems, showing efficiency for feasibility; hybrid approaches with CP-SAT improve optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage clause-learning SAT solving for efficient feasibility detection in discrete facility layout problems, compared to CP-SAT and MILP, while addressing its optimization limitations.

Method: Formulate layout problems as CNF, benchmark CDCL against CP-SAT and MILP, and develop two hybrid architectures combining CDCL feasibility search with CP-SAT optimization.

Result: CDCL shows near-constant runtime for feasibility, outperforming CP-SAT (polynomial) and MILP (exponential); hybrids reduce solution time while maintaining correctness.

Conclusion: Hybrid methods clarify trade-offs between clause-learning and exact optimization, enabling faster solutions in large-scale discrete layout problems.

Abstract: This paper studies the use of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) with VSIDS heuristics as a computational engine for discrete facility layout problems. The facility layout problem is modeled as a combinatorial assignment problem with dense logical structure arising from adjacency, separation, and slot-availability constraints. We develop a CNF-based formulation for layout feasibility and compare CDCL-based SAT solving against CP-SAT and MILP formulations under a unified benchmarking framework. Empirical results show that CDCL exhibits near-constant runtime behavior for feasibility detection across increasing problem sizes and constraint densities, while CP-SAT and MILP display polynomial and exponential scaling respectively. To address the limitation of CDCL in objective optimization, we introduce two hybrid architectures that combine CDCL-based feasibility search with CP-SAT optimization. The first architecture rapidly enumerates feasible layouts to trade optimality for speed, while the second uses CDCL to generate warm-start solutions that accelerate exact optimization. The results demonstrate that hybrid approaches can significantly reduce time-to-solution while preserving correctness guarantees, clarifying the algorithmic trade-offs between clause-learning search and exact optimization methods in large-scale discrete layout problems.

### [4] [Agent-Based Output Drift Detection for Breast Cancer Response Prediction in a Multisite Clinical Decision Support System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18450)
*Xavier Rafael-Palou,Jose Munuera,Ana Jimenez-Pastor,Richard Osuala,Karim Lekadir,Oliver Diaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agent-based framework improves drift detection in multi-site clinical AI systems by using site-specific monitoring agents, outperforming centralized methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive models in clinical decision support systems degrade across sites due to variations in patient populations, imaging hardware, and protocols, requiring effective drift detection without ground truth labels.

Method: Propose an agent-based framework with drift monitoring agents per site for batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against reference distributions, tested using simulated multi-center environments and various reference schemes (site-specific, global, production-only, adaptive).

Result: Multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with up to 10.3% F1-score improvement in drift detection; adaptive scheme achieves 74.3% F1-score for drift detection and 83.7% for severity classification when site-specific references are unavailable.

Conclusion: Adaptive, site-aware agent-based drift monitoring enhances the reliability of multisite clinical decision support systems by effectively managing drift and improving detection performance.

Abstract: Modern clinical decision support systems can concurrently serve multiple, independent medical imaging institutions, but their predictive performance may degrade across sites due to variations in patient populations, imaging hardware, and acquisition protocols. Continuous surveillance of predictive model outputs offers a safe and reliable approach for identifying such distributional shifts without ground truth labels. However, most existing methods rely on centralized monitoring of aggregated predictions, overlooking site-specific drift dynamics. We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification. These findings suggest that adaptive, site-aware agent-based drift monitoring can enhance reliability of multisite clinical decision support systems.

### [5] [Faithful and Stable Neuron Explanations for Trustworthy Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18092)
*Ge Yan,Tuomas Oikarinen,Tsui-Wei,Weng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First theoretical analysis of neuron identification, providing guarantees for faithfulness and stability via generalization bounds and a bootstrap ensemble method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neuron identification methods lack rigorous theoretical foundations, making explanations potentially untrustworthy. The authors aim to establish theoretical guarantees for faithfulness and stability of neuron explanations.

Method: The authors frame neuron identification as the inverse of machine learning, derive generalization bounds for similarity metrics to guarantee faithfulness, and propose a bootstrap ensemble (BE) procedure to quantify stability and generate concept prediction sets with coverage guarantees.

Result: Theoretical analysis provides generalization bounds for faithfulness metrics and a BE method that quantifies stability with guaranteed coverage probability. Experiments on synthetic and real data validate the theoretical results.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed theoretical framework and BE method provide reliable guarantees for neuron identification, offering an important step toward trustworthy mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: Neuron identification is a popular tool in mechanistic interpretability, aiming to uncover the human-interpretable concepts represented by individual neurons in deep networks. While algorithms such as Network Dissection and CLIP-Dissect achieve great empirical success, a rigorous theoretical foundation remains absent, which is crucial to enable trustworthy and reliable explanations. In this work, we observe that neuron identification can be viewed as the inverse process of machine learning, which allows us to derive guarantees for neuron explanations. Based on this insight, we present the first theoretical analysis of two fundamental challenges: (1) Faithfulness: whether the identified concept faithfully represents the neuron's underlying function and (2) Stability: whether the identification results are consistent across probing datasets. We derive generalization bounds for widely used similarity metrics (e.g. accuracy, AUROC, IoU) to guarantee faithfulness, and propose a bootstrap ensemble procedure that quantifies stability along with BE (Bootstrap Explanation) method to generate concept prediction sets with guaranteed coverage probability. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the practicality of our method, providing an important step toward trustworthy neuron identification.

### [6] [Unifying Causal Reinforcement Learning: Survey, Taxonomy, Algorithms and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18135)
*Cristiano da Costa Cunha,Wei Liu,Tim French,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey paper reviewing how causal reinforcement learning (CRL) integrates causal inference with RL to solve correlation-based limitations, addressing challenges like distribution shifts and lack of explainability through systematic categorization and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical limitations in classical RL including low explainability, lack of robustness, and generalization failures when faced with distribution shifts, confounding variables, and dynamic environments

Method: Systematic review and categorization of existing approaches into five main areas: causal representation learning, counterfactual policy optimization, offline causal RL, causal transfer learning, and causal explainability

Result: Identified prevailing challenges, highlighted empirical successes in practical applications, and discussed open problems in the field

Conclusion: CRL shows strong potential for developing robust, generalizable, and interpretable AI systems by addressing fundamental limitations of classical RL.

Abstract: Integrating causal inference (CI) with reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to address critical limitations in classical RL, including low explainability, lack of robustness and generalization failures. Traditional RL techniques, which typically rely on correlation-driven decision-making, struggle when faced with distribution shifts, confounding variables, and dynamic environments. Causal reinforcement learning (CRL), leveraging the foundational principles of causal inference, offers promising solutions to these challenges by explicitly modeling cause-and-effect relationships. In this survey, we systematically review recent advancements at the intersection of causal inference and RL. We categorize existing approaches into causal representation learning, counterfactual policy optimization, offline causal RL, causal transfer learning, and causal explainability. Through this structured analysis, we identify prevailing challenges, highlight empirical successes in practical applications, and discuss open problems. Finally, we provide future research directions, underscoring the potential of CRL for developing robust, generalizable, and interpretable artificial intelligence systems.

*Alex Wilf,Pranjal Aggarwal,Bryan Parno,Daniel Fried,Louis-Philippe Morency,Paul Pu Liang,Sean Welleck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-play with formal verification (PSV) significantly improves code generation, achieving up to 9.6x better pass@1 over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-play without human data is a longstanding AI goal, but its effectiveness for large language models in code generation is unclear, especially with brittle unit test rewards. Verified code generation with formal verification provides reliable correctness signals.

Method: Propose, Solve, Verify (PSV): a self-play framework with formal verification to create a proposer generating challenging synthetic problems and a solver trained via expert iteration.

Result: PSV-Verus improves pass@1 by up to 9.6x over inference-only and expert-iteration baselines across three benchmarks. Performance scales with generated questions and training iterations, and formal verification and difficulty-aware proposal are essential.

Conclusion: The PSV framework, combining formal verification and difficulty-aware proposal, enables effective self-play for verified code generation, with PSV-Verus achieving significant performance improvements over baselines. The study confirms that self-play can be effective for large language models in code generation when using reliable verification signals.

Abstract: Training models through self-play alone (without any human data) has been a longstanding goal in AI, but its effectiveness for training large language models remains unclear, particularly in code generation where rewards based on unit tests are brittle and prone to error propagation. We study self-play in the verified code generation setting, where formal verification provides reliable correctness signals. We introduce Propose, Solve, Verify (PSV) a simple self-play framework where formal verification signals are used to create a proposer capable of generating challenging synthetic problems and a solver trained via expert iteration. We use PSV to train PSV-Verus, which across three benchmarks improves pass@1 by up to 9.6x over inference-only and expert-iteration baselines. We show that performance scales with the number of generated questions and training iterations, and through ablations identify formal verification and difficulty-aware proposal as essential ingredients for successful self-play.

### [8] [NEURO-GUARD: Neuro-Symbolic Generalization and Unbiased Adaptive Routing for Diagnostics -- Explainable Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18177)
*Midhat Urooj,Ayan Banerjee,Sandeep Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NEURO-GUARD is a novel knowledge-guided vision framework that integrates Vision Transformers with language-driven reasoning, using retrieval-augmented generation and clinical knowledge to improve interpretability, generalization, and performance in medical image diagnosis across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate yet interpretable image-based diagnosis in medical AI, especially in settings with limited data, subtle visual cues, and high-stakes decisions. Existing vision models are often black-box, lack interpretability, and have poor cross-domain generalization, hindering clinical adoption.

Method: NEURO-GUARD is a knowledge-guided vision framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs) with language-driven reasoning. It employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism for self-verification, where a large language model (LLM) iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines feature-extraction code for medical images, leveraging clinical guidelines and expert knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments on diabetic retinopathy classification across four datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, Messidor-2) show NEURO-GUARD improves accuracy by 6.2% over a ViT-only baseline (84.69% vs. 78.4%) and achieves a 5% gain in domain generalization. Additional evaluations on MRI-based seizure detection confirm its cross-domain robustness, consistently outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: NEURO-GUARD successfully bridges symbolic medical reasoning with subsymbolic visual learning, enabling interpretable, knowledge-aware, and generalizable medical image diagnosis. The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and domain generalization over baseline models.

Abstract: Accurate yet interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a central challenge in medical AI, particularly in settings characterized by limited data, subtle visual cues, and high-stakes clinical decision-making. Most existing vision models rely on purely data-driven learning and produce black-box predictions with limited interpretability and poor cross-domain generalization, hindering their real-world clinical adoption. We present NEURO-GUARD, a novel knowledge-guided vision framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs) with language-driven reasoning to improve performance, transparency, and domain robustness. NEURO-GUARD employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism for self-verification, in which a large language model (LLM) iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines feature-extraction code for medical images. By grounding this process in clinical guidelines and expert knowledge, the framework progressively enhances feature detection and classification beyond purely data-driven baselines. Extensive experiments on diabetic retinopathy classification across four benchmark datasets APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, and Messidor-2 demonstrate that NEURO-GUARD improves accuracy by 6.2% over a ViT-only baseline (84.69% vs. 78.4%) and achieves a 5% gain in domain generalization. Additional evaluations on MRI-based seizure detection further confirm its cross-domain robustness, consistently outperforming existing methods.
  Overall, NEURO-GUARD bridges symbolic medical reasoning with subsymbolic visual learning, enabling interpretable, knowledge-aware, and generalizable medical image diagnosis while achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.

### [9] [NL2CA: Auto-formalizing Cognitive Decision-Making from Natural Language Using an Unsupervised CriticNL2LTL Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18189)
*Zihao Deng,Yijia Li,Renrui Zhang,Peijun Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NL2CA is an automated method that converts natural language descriptions of human experience into executable cognitive decision-making rules using LLMs, LTL translation, and reinforcement learning, validated in translation benchmarks and driving simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the development of cognitive computing models for human decision-making, which traditionally requires labor-intensive manual or human-guided interactive modeling approaches.

Method: The approach translates text into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using a fine-tuned LLM, refines logic via unsupervised Critic Tree, transforms into executable production rules, and constructs cognitive agents optimized through cognitive reinforcement learning with real-world behavioral data.

Result: In NL-to-LTL translation, CriticNL2LTL achieved consistent performance across expert and large-scale benchmarks without human intervention. In cognitive driving simulation, agents constructed from human interviews successfully learned diverse decision patterns in about 70 critical scenario trials.

Conclusion: NL2CA enables scalable, interpretable, and human-aligned cognitive modeling from unstructured textual data, offering a novel paradigm to automatically design symbolic cognitive agents.

Abstract: Cognitive computing models offer a formal and interpretable way to characterize human's deliberation and decision-making, yet their development remains labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose NL2CA, a novel method for auto-formalizing cognitive decision-making rules from natural language descriptions of human experience. Different from most related work that exploits either pure manual or human guided interactive modeling, our method is fully automated without any human intervention. The approach first translates text into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), then refines the logic via an unsupervised Critic Tree, and finally transforms the output into executable production rules compatible with symbolic cognitive frameworks. Based on the resulted rules, a cognitive agent is further constructed and optimized through cognitive reinforcement learning according to the real-world behavioral data. Our method is validated in two domains: (1) NL-to-LTL translation, where our CriticNL2LTL module achieves consistent performance across both expert and large-scale benchmarks without human-in-the-loop feed-backs, and (2) cognitive driving simulation, where agents automatically constructed from human interviews have successfully learned the diverse decision patterns of about 70 trials in different critical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that NL2CA enables scalable, interpretable, and human-aligned cognitive modeling from unstructured textual data, offering a novel paradigm to automatically design symbolic cognitive agents.

### [10] [External Hippocampus: Topological Cognitive Maps for Guiding Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18190)
*Jian Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The External Hippocampus framework enables efficient, controllable multi-step reasoning for small language models by modeling reasoning as energy flow in semantic space, using topological cognitive maps to guide and intervene in the process without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional weight-space optimization methods for language models often require substantial computational resources and struggle with cognitive deadlock in multi-step reasoning for small models. This paper aims to provide an efficient, low-resource solution that enables precise navigation and intervention during reasoning.

Method: The framework constructs topological cognitive maps through dimensionality reduction projection to model reasoning as the flow of information energy in semantic space. It enables precise navigation and intervention of this energy flow at test time, avoiding heavy computational requirements. Tools include map-guided methods, temperature perturbations to restart energy flow, and autonomous growth capability.

Result: Experiments on models with ≤7B parameters show: map-guided methods achieve 81.20% accuracy on 500 challenging problems (a +16.80% improvement over the baseline), reduce reasoning time by ≥15x, and reveal that reasoning stagnation correlates with 'Cognitive Vortex' and low-entropy potential wells, while temperature perturbations effectively restart energy flow.

Conclusion: The External Hippocampus framework offers an efficient, controllable, and topological-aware solution for small model reasoning, requiring no additional training, possessing autonomous growth capability, and effectively addressing cognitive deadlock in multi-step reasoning with predictable intervention patterns.

Abstract: This paper proposes the External Hippocampus framework, which models language model reasoning from a cognitive dynamics perspective as the flow of information energy in semantic space. Unlike traditional weight-space optimization methods, this framework constructs topological cognitive maps through dimensionality reduction projection, enabling precise navigation and intervention of energy flow at test time while avoiding substantial computational requirements and demonstrating predictable intervention patterns. The method effectively addresses the cognitive deadlock problem in multi-step reasoning for small models. Experiments on models <=7B parameters show: map-guided methods achieve 81.20% accuracy on 500 challenging problems (relative baseline +16.80%), reduce reasoning time by >= 15x, with key findings revealing that reasoning stagnation manifests as "Cognitive Vortex" and low-entropy potential wells, while temperature perturbations effectively restart energy flow. The framework requires no additional training, possesses autonomous growth capability, and provides an efficient and controllable topological-aware solution for small model reasoning.

### [11] [Sophia: A Persistent Agent Framework of Artificial Life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18202)
*Mingyang Sun,Feng Hong,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes System 3, a meta-layer for AI agents enabling persistent identity and self-improvement. Introduces Sophia, a wrapper with four mechanisms that reduces reasoning steps and improves complex task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that current LLM-based AI agents are largely static and reactive, lacking a persistent meta-layer for maintaining identity, verifying reasoning, and aligning short-term actions with long-term survival. There is a need for agents that can autonomously adapt and self-improve over extended periods.

Method: The method involves proposing a System 3 meta-layer that maps psychological constructs to computational modules. The authors introduce Sophia, a Persistent Agent wrapper that integrates four mechanisms: process-supervised thought search, narrative memory, user and self modeling, and a hybrid reward system. They provide an engineering prototype to demonstrate the framework.

Result: Quantitatively, Sophia achieved an 80% reduction in reasoning steps for recurring operations and a 40% improvement in success rates for high-complexity tasks. Qualitatively, System 3 demonstrated coherent narrative identity and an innate capacity for task organization.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the System 3 framework and Sophia prototype provide a practical pathway toward artificial life by integrating psychological insights with computational modules, enabling persistent identity and autonomous self-improvement in AI agents.

Abstract: The development of LLMs has elevated AI agents from task-specific tools to long-lived, decision-making entities. Yet, most architectures remain static and reactive, tethered to manually defined, narrow scenarios. These systems excel at perception (System 1) and deliberation (System 2) but lack a persistent meta-layer to maintain identity, verify reasoning, and align short-term actions with long-term survival. We first propose a third stratum, System 3, that presides over the agent's narrative identity and long-horizon adaptation. The framework maps selected psychological constructs to concrete computational modules, thereby translating abstract notions of artificial life into implementable design requirements. The ideas coalesce in Sophia, a "Persistent Agent" wrapper that grafts a continuous self-improvement loop onto any LLM-centric System 1/2 stack. Sophia is driven by four synergistic mechanisms: process-supervised thought search, narrative memory, user and self modeling, and a hybrid reward system. Together, they transform repetitive reasoning into a self-driven, autobiographical process, enabling identity continuity and transparent behavioral explanations. Although the paper is primarily conceptual, we provide a compact engineering prototype to anchor the discussion. Quantitatively, Sophia independently initiates and executes various intrinsic tasks while achieving an 80% reduction in reasoning steps for recurring operations. Notably, meta-cognitive persistence yielded a 40% gain in success for high-complexity tasks, effectively bridging the performance gap between simple and sophisticated goals. Qualitatively, System 3 exhibited a coherent narrative identity and an innate capacity for task organization. By fusing psychological insight with a lightweight reinforcement-learning core, the persistent agent architecture advances a possible practical pathway toward artificial life.

### [12] [MSC-180: A Benchmark for Automated Formal Theorem Proving from Mathematical Subject Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18256)
*Sirui Li,Wangyue Lu,Xiaorui Shi,Ke Weng,Haozhe Sun,Minghe Yu,Tiancheng Zhang,Ge Yu,Hengyu Liu,Lun Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSC-180 is a benchmark of 180 formal verification problems across 60 mathematical branches, designed to evaluate LLM-based theorem provers, showing poor performance and highlighting limitations in domain coverage and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based theorem provers have restricted domain coverage and weak generalization in mathematical reasoning, necessitating a comprehensive benchmark to assess and improve their capabilities.

Method: Propose MSC-180, a benchmark based on MSC2020 classification with 180 problems (3 per branch), verified by experts, and evaluate state-of-the-art LLM provers using pass@32 and coefficient of variation metrics.

Result: Best model achieves only 18.89% overall pass rate, with max domain coverage of 41.7%, lower performance on graduate-level problems, and high coefficient of variation (4-6 times above threshold), indicating reliance on pattern matching.

Conclusion: MSC-180 and its evaluation framework provide a discriminative benchmark for developing AI systems with genuine mathematical reasoning, revealing current models' shortcomings in transferable reasoning and generalization.

Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) represents a core research direction in artificial intelligence for achieving formal reasoning and verification, playing a significant role in advancing machine intelligence. However, current large language model (LLM)-based theorem provers suffer from limitations such as restricted domain coverage and weak generalization in mathematical reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MSC-180, a benchmark for evaluation based on the MSC2020 mathematical subject classification. It comprises 180 formal verification problems, 3 advanced problems from each of 60 mathematical branches, spanning from undergraduate to graduate levels. Each problem has undergone multiple rounds of verification and refinement by domain experts to ensure formal accuracy. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers under the pass@32 setting reveal that the best model achieves only an 18.89% overall pass rate, with prominent issues including significant domain bias (maximum domain coverage 41.7%) and a difficulty gap (significantly lower pass rates on graduate-level problems). To further quantify performance variability across mathematical domains, we introduce the coefficient of variation (CV) as an evaluation metric. The observed CV values are 4-6 times higher than the statistical high-variability threshold, indicating that the models still rely on pattern matching from training corpora rather than possessing transferable reasoning mechanisms and systematic generalization capabilities. MSC-180, together with its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, provides a discriminative and systematic benchmark for driving the development of next-generation AI systems with genuine mathematical reasoning abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional simulation-based data analysis creates barriers between human experts and operational insights, limiting effective collaboration in manufacturing planning.

Method: Develop a framework that transforms simulation data into semantic representations using Knowledge Graphs and employs collaborative LLM agents with iterative reasoning for natural language queries and validation.

Result: Near-perfect accuracy for operational inquiries via natural language, and effective support in uncovering interconnected issues for investigative collaborative analysis.

Conclusion: The system advances collaborative manufacturing by reducing cognitive load and amplifying human analytical capabilities through intuitive, actionable insights.

Abstract: Manufacturing planners face complex operational challenges that require seamless collaboration between human expertise and intelligent systems to achieve optimal performance in modern production environments. Traditional approaches to analyzing simulation-based manufacturing data often create barriers between human decision-makers and critical operational insights, limiting effective partnership in manufacturing planning. Our framework establishes a collaborative intelligence system integrating Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Model-based agents to bridge this gap, empowering manufacturing professionals through natural language interfaces for complex operational analysis. The system transforms simulation data into semantically rich representations, enabling planners to interact naturally with operational insights without specialized expertise. A collaborative LLM agent works alongside human decision-makers, employing iterative reasoning that mirrors human analytical thinking while generating precise queries for knowledge extraction and providing transparent validation. This partnership approach to manufacturing bottleneck identification, validated through operational scenarios, demonstrates enhanced performance while maintaining human oversight and decision authority. For operational inquiries, the system achieves near-perfect accuracy through natural language interaction. For investigative scenarios requiring collaborative analysis, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in supporting human experts to uncover interconnected operational issues that enhance understanding and decision-making. This work advances collaborative manufacturing by creating intuitive methods for actionable insights, reducing cognitive load while amplifying human analytical capabilities in evolving manufacturing ecosystems.

### [14] [Monitoring Monitorability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18311)
*Melody Y. Guan,Miles Wang,Micah Carroll,Zehao Dou,Annie Y. Wei,Marcus Williams,Benjamin Arnav,Joost Huizinga,Ian Kivlichan,Mia Glaese,Jakub Pachocki,Bowen Baker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes evaluation frameworks and a metric to assess the monitorability of AI systems via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, showing CoT monitoring is more effective than action-only monitoring, and explores how factors like compute and scaling impact monitorability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observability into AI decision-making is crucial for safe deployment, but existing CoT-based monitoring may be fragile under varied training, data, or scaling, necessitating robust ways to measure and track monitorability.

Method: The authors introduce three evaluation archetypes (intervention, process, and outcome-property), a new monitorability metric, and a broad evaluation suite, applying them to test models including those trained to obfuscate CoTs and frontier models under different conditions.

Result: CoT monitoring outperforms action-only monitoring in practical settings; most frontier models are fairly monitorable but not perfect. Monitorability improves with longer CoTs, remains stable under RL optimization, and can be enhanced by using smaller models with higher reasoning effort or by scaling monitor compute and access to CoT.

Conclusion: CoT-based monitoring is effective and can be enhanced through strategic adaptations like follow-up questions and compute scaling, offering a path to safer AI deployment by improving observability without compromising model capabilities.

Abstract: Observability into the decision making of modern AI systems may be required to safely deploy increasingly capable agents. Monitoring the chain-of-thought (CoT) of today's reasoning models has proven effective for detecting misbehavior. However, this "monitorability" may be fragile under different training procedures, data sources, or even continued system scaling. To measure and track monitorability, we propose three evaluation archetypes (intervention, process, and outcome-property) and a new monitorability metric, and introduce a broad evaluation suite. We demonstrate that these evaluations can catch simple model organisms trained to have obfuscated CoTs, and that CoT monitoring is more effective than action-only monitoring in practical settings. We compare the monitorability of various frontier models and find that most models are fairly, but not perfectly, monitorable. We also evaluate how monitorability scales with inference-time compute, reinforcement learning optimization, and pre-training model size. We find that longer CoTs are generally more monitorable and that RL optimization does not materially decrease monitorability even at the current frontier scale. Notably, we find that for a model at a low reasoning effort, we could instead deploy a smaller model at a higher reasoning effort (thereby matching capabilities) and obtain a higher monitorability, albeit at a higher overall inference compute cost. We further investigate agent-monitor scaling trends and find that scaling a weak monitor's test-time compute when monitoring a strong agent increases monitorability. Giving the weak monitor access to CoT not only improves monitorability, but it steepens the monitor's test-time compute to monitorability scaling trend. Finally, we show we can improve monitorability by asking models follow-up questions and giving their follow-up CoT to the monitor.

### [15] [Few-Shot Learning of a Graph-Based Neural Network Model Without Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18412)
*Mykyta Lapin,Kostiantyn Bokhan,Yurii Parzhyn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A structural-graph approach for few-shot classification of contour images without backpropagation, using attributed graphs and concept attractors. Achieves ~82% accuracy on MNIST subset with 5-6 examples per class, providing transparent decisions through graph structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a few-shot learning approach that does not rely on backpropagation and provides transparent, explainable decisions. The core idea is to make structure the carrier of explanations, encoding images as attributed graphs and achieving generalization via concept attractors (class-level concept graphs). This aims to enable few-shot learning with only 5-6 examples per class while offering full traceability of decisions.

Method: The method involves encoding contour images as attributed graphs (critical points and lines as nodes with geometric attributes). A bipartite graph (Point/Line nodes) is constructed with normalized geometric attributes like coordinates, length, angle, and direction. Structural reductions eliminate unstable substructures or noise and align paths between critical points. Class concepts are formed by iterative composition of few-shot samples. Classification is performed by selecting the best graph-to-concept match using approximated graph edit distance (GED).

Result: On an MNIST subset with 5-6 base examples per class (single epoch), the method achieves consistent accuracy of around 82% with full traceability of decisions. Misclassifications can be explained by explicit structural similarities. The paper provides an indicative comparison with SVM, MLP, CNN, and metric/meta-learning baselines.

Conclusion: This paper concludes that a structural-graph approach with concept attractors enables few-shot learning without backpropagation, providing transparent decisions and built-in explanations through explicit graph structures. The method achieves around 82% accuracy on an MNIST subset with 5-6 examples per class. Limitations include computational cost of graph edit distance and skeletonization quality. Future work includes optimization of classification algorithms, application to static scenes, and associative recognition.

Abstract: We propose a structural-graph approach to classifying contour images in a few-shot regime without using backpropagation. The core idea is to make structure the carrier of explanations: an image is encoded as an attributed graph (critical points and lines represented as nodes with geometric attributes), and generalization is achieved via the formation of concept attractors (class-level concept graphs). Purpose. To design and experimentally validate an architecture in which class concepts are formed from a handful of examples (5 - 6 per class) through structural and parametric reductions, providing transparent decisions and eliminating backpropagation. Methods. Contour vectorization is followed by constructing a bipartite graph (Point/Line as nodes) with normalized geometric attributes such as coordinates, length, angle, and direction; reductions include the elimination of unstable substructures or noise and the alignment of paths between critical points. Concepts are formed by iterative composition of samples, and classification is performed by selecting the best graph-to-concept match (using approximated GED). Results. On an MNIST subset with 5 - 6 base examples per class (single epoch), we obtain a consistent accuracy of around 82% with full traceability of decisions: misclassifications can be explained by explicit structural similarities. An indicative comparison with SVM, MLP, CNN, as well as metric and meta-learning baselines, is provided. The structural-graph scheme with concept attractors enables few-shot learning without backpropagation and offers built-in explanations through the explicit graph structure. Limitations concern the computational cost of GED and the quality of skeletonization; promising directions include classification-algorithm optimization, work with static scenes, and associative recognition.

### [16] [Insider Threat Detection Using GCN and Bi-LSTM with Explicit and Implicit Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18483)
*Rahul Yumlembam,Biju Issac,Seibu Mary Jacob,Longzhi Yang,Deepa Krishnan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A post-hoc insider threat detection framework combines explicit and implicit graph representations with temporal modeling to identify subtle malicious activities by trusted users, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on CERT datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insider threat detection is difficult due to the subtle and concealed nature of malicious activities by trusted users, requiring advanced techniques to model complex behavior patterns.

Method: The framework constructs an explicit graph from predefined organizational rules to model direct user activity relationships, learns an implicit graph via Gumbel-Softmax from feature similarities for latent relationships, uses GCNs for node embeddings, refines them with attention, and processes with a Bi-LSTM for temporal dependencies, flagging activities as anomalous based on a threshold.

Result: On CERT r5.2: AUC 98.62, detection rate 100%, false positive rate 0.05. On CERT r6.2: AUC 88.48, detection rate 80.15%, false positive rate 0.15, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines graph-based and temporal representations for robust insider threat detection, demonstrating high accuracy and low false positives in experiments.

Abstract: Insider threat detection (ITD) is challenging due to the subtle and concealed nature of malicious activities performed by trusted users. This paper proposes a post-hoc ITD framework that integrates explicit and implicit graph representations with temporal modelling to capture complex user behaviour patterns. An explicit graph is constructed using predefined organisational rules to model direct relationships among user activities. To mitigate noise and limitations in this hand-crafted structure, an implicit graph is learned from feature similarities using the Gumbel-Softmax trick, enabling the discovery of latent behavioural relationships. Separate Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) process the explicit and implicit graphs to generate node embeddings, which are concatenated and refined through an attention mechanism to emphasise threat-relevant features. The refined representations are then passed to a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies in user behaviour. Activities are flagged as anomalous when their probability scores fall below a predefined threshold. Extensive experiments on CERT r5.2 and r6.2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On r5.2, the model achieves an AUC of 98.62, a detection rate of 100%, and a false positive rate of 0.05. On the more challenging r6.2 dataset, it attains an AUC of 88.48, a detection rate of 80.15%, and a false positive rate of 0.15, highlighting the effectiveness of combining graph-based and temporal representations for robust ITD.

### [17] [Large Language Models as Discounted Bayesian Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18489)
*Jensen Zhang,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs perform online belief updating similar to Bayesian filtering but exhibit systematic forgetting of older evidence, with miscalibrated priors; prompting strategies can recalibrate them efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate online inference capabilities of Large Language Models in dynamic, stochastic environments, addressing the gap in understanding how LLMs update beliefs over time when acting as world models or agents.

Method: The authors introduce a Bayesian filtering framework and a probabilistic probe suite covering multivariate discrete distributions (e.g., dice rolls) and continuous distributions (e.g., Gaussian processes) with time-varying parameters, evaluating LLMs through simulated tasks and proposing prompting strategies for recalibration.

Result: The study finds that LLM belief updates resemble Bayesian posteriors but are better characterized by an exponential forgetting filter with a model-specific discount factor <1, indicating systematic discounting of old evidence, with variance across architectures, and that priors are often miscalibrated but updating remains structured.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that despite miscalibrated priors, LLMs exhibit structured and principled belief updating resembling Bayesian filtering with systematic forgetting, and that prompting strategies can effectively recalibrate priors at minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong few-shot generalization through in-context learning, yet their reasoning in dynamic and stochastic environments remains opaque. Prior studies mainly focus on static tasks and overlook the online adaptation required when beliefs must be continuously updated, which is a key capability for LLMs acting as world models or agents. We introduce a Bayesian filtering framework to evaluate online inference in LLMs. Our probabilistic probe suite spans both multivariate discrete distributions, such as dice rolls, and continuous distributions, such as Gaussian processes, where ground-truth parameters shift over time. We find that while LLM belief updates resemble Bayesian posteriors, they are more accurately characterized by an exponential forgetting filter with a model-specific discount factor smaller than one. This reveals systematic discounting of older evidence that varies significantly across model architectures. Although inherent priors are often miscalibrated, the updating mechanism itself remains structured and principled. We further validate these findings in a simulated agent task and propose prompting strategies that effectively recalibrate priors with minimal computational cost.

TL;DR: Vox Deorum is a hybrid LLM+X architecture that enables Large Language Models to play Civilization V competitively by handling macro-strategic reasoning while delegating tactical execution to subsystems, achieving unique play styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' natural language reasoning capabilities make them promising for 4X games, but cost, latency, and complexity challenges hinder real-world deployment in these complex, long-horizon strategy games.

Method: Developed Vox Deorum - a layered hybrid architecture that uses LLMs for high-level strategic reasoning while delegating tactical execution to specialized subsystems, tested on Civilization V with Vox Populi mod through 2,327 complete games.

Result: LLMs achieved competitive gameplay performance compared to enhanced AI, while exhibiting substantially different play styles from algorithmic AI and from each other.

Conclusion: The hybrid LLM+X architecture provides a viable solution for integrating LLMs in commercial 4X games, opening new opportunities for game design and AI research.

Abstract: Large Language Models' capacity to reason in natural language makes them uniquely promising for 4X and grand strategy games, enabling more natural human-AI gameplay interactions such as collaboration and negotiation. However, these games present unique challenges due to their complexity and long-horizon nature, while latency and cost factors may hinder LLMs' real-world deployment. Working on a classic 4X strategy game, Sid Meier's Civilization V with the Vox Populi mod, we introduce Vox Deorum, a hybrid LLM+X architecture. Our layered technical design empowers LLMs to handle macro-strategic reasoning, delegating tactical execution to subsystems (e.g., algorithmic AI or reinforcement learning AI in the future). We validate our approach through 2,327 complete games, comparing two open-source LLMs with a simple prompt against Vox Populi's enhanced AI. Results show that LLMs achieve competitive end-to-end gameplay while exhibiting play styles that diverge substantially from algorithmic AI and from each other. Our work establishes a viable architecture for integrating LLMs in commercial 4X games, opening new opportunities for game design and agentic AI research.

TL;DR: Proposes cost-aware embodied reasoning framework ESearch-R1 with HC-GRPO for balancing physical exploration, human interaction, and navigation costs


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embodied agents fail to balance physical exploration costs against human interaction costs when facing ambiguous instructions, lacking strategic reasoning for minimizing total task execution costs

Method: Introduces ESearch-R1 framework integrating interactive dialogue, episodic memory retrieval, and physical navigation, and HC-GRPO algorithm for optimizing trade-offs between information gain and heterogeneous costs

Result: ESearch-R1 significantly outperforms ReAct-based agents, improving task success rates while reducing total operational costs by approximately 50% in AI2-THOR experiments

Conclusion: ESearch-R1 with HC-GRPO effectively balances exploration, human interaction, and navigation costs, enabling more efficient embodied task completion

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have empowered embodied agents with remarkable capabilities in planning and reasoning. However, when facing ambiguous natural language instructions (e.g., "fetch the tool" in a cluttered room), current agents often fail to balance the high cost of physical exploration against the cognitive cost of human interaction. They typically treat disambiguation as a passive perception problem, lacking the strategic reasoning to minimize total task execution costs. To bridge this gap, we propose ESearch-R1, a cost-aware embodied reasoning framework that unifies interactive dialogue (Ask), episodic memory retrieval (GetMemory), and physical navigation (Navigate) into a single decision process. We introduce HC-GRPO (Heterogeneous Cost-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization). Unlike traditional PPO which relies on a separate value critic, HC-GRPO optimizes the MLLM by sampling groups of reasoning trajectories and reinforcing those that achieve the optimal trade-off between information gain and heterogeneous costs (e.g., navigate time, and human attention). Extensive experiments in AI2-THOR demonstrate that ESearch-R1 significantly outperforms standard ReAct-based agents. It improves task success rates while reducing total operational costs by approximately 50\%, validating the effectiveness of GRPO in aligning MLLM agents with physical world constraints.

### [20] [Reflective Confidence: Correcting Reasoning Flaws via Online Self-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18605)
*Qinglin Zeng,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposed reflective confidence framework uses low-confidence signals as reflection triggers for self-correction, improving LLM reasoning accuracy over early-stopping methods at similar computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensemble-based reasoning approaches like self-consistency, used to boost LLM reasoning performance, incur high computational costs due to multiple reasoning trajectories. Early-stopping strategies (e.g., DeepConf) reduce cost by terminating low-confidence trajectories but waste partial computation and discard incomplete reasoning paths. The goal is to improve efficiency without discarding useful partial reasoning, thus enhancing accuracy at comparable cost.

Method: The proposed method, called reflective confidence, modifies the typical early-stopping strategy. Instead of halting low-confidence reasoning trajectories, it triggers a reflection prompt. This prompt encourages the model to analyze its current reasoning state, identify potential errors or misconceptions, and then continue generation along a corrected trajectory. This process actively leverages partially generated content to improve reasoning rather than discarding it.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME 2025, show that reflective confidence significantly improves accuracy over advanced early-stopping baselines while maintaining comparable computational cost. This demonstrates that proactive self-correction (reflection) outperforms passive discarding of low-confidence trajectories.

Conclusion: The reflective confidence framework provides an effective approach to enhance reasoning efficiency in LLMs by converting low-confidence signals into reflection triggers rather than termination signals. This leads to better accuracy while maintaining computational cost compared to traditional early-stopping methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on complex reasoning tasks using techniques such as chain-of-thought and self-consistency. However, ensemble-based approaches, especially self-consistency which relies on multiple reasoning trajectories, often incur substantial computational overhead. To improve efficiency, prior work has leveraged internal confidence signals, where early stopping strategies such as DeepConf reduce cost by terminating low-confidence trajectories. However, this strategy discards incomplete reasoning paths and wastes partial computation.
  We propose reflective confidence, a novel reasoning framework that transforms low-confidence signals from termination indicators into reflection triggers. When confidence falls below a threshold, instead of stopping generation, the model produces a reflection prompt to analyze the current reasoning state, identify potential errors, and continue generation along a corrected trajectory. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME 2025, demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over advanced early-stopping baselines at comparable computational cost, validating the effectiveness of proactive self-correction over passive discarding.

Motivation: Extending previous MIP solvers to address practical packaging-planning scenarios with richer constraints like multiple placeholder options, time-frame restrictions, and multi-class item packaging.

Method: Develops a tailored solver using Gurobi and cutting-plane subtour elimination, extending exact MIP techniques for the Joint Routing-Assignment problem.

Result: Experiments on 46 datasets show stable low computation times and global optima, significantly outperforming exact and greedy baselines by up to an order of magnitude in efficiency.

Conclusion: MIP-based JRA optimization is practical for robotic packaging, motion planning, and complex logistics, offering high efficiency and solution quality.

Abstract: We study the Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) problem in which items must be assigned one-to-one to placeholders while simultaneously determining a Hamiltonian cycle visiting all nodes exactly once. Extending previous exact MIP solvers with Gurobi and cutting-plane subtour elimination, we develop a solver tailored for practical packaging-planning scenarios with richer constraints.These include multiple placeholder options, time-frame restrictions, and multi-class item packaging. Experiments on 46 mobile manipulation datasets demonstrate that the proposed MIP approach achieves global optima with stable and low computation times, significantly outperforming the shaking-based exact solver by up to an orders of magnitude. Compared to greedy baselines, the MIP solutions achieve consistent optimal distances with an average deviation of 14% for simple heuristics, confirming both efficiency and solution quality. The results highlight the practical applicability of MIP-based JRA optimization for robotic packaging, motion planning, and complex logistics .

TL;DR: ChronoDreamer predicts future video, contact, and proprioception via spatial-temporal transformer; uses Gaussian splat contact encoding and vision-language model for safety evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an action-conditioned world model capable of predicting future states including contact interactions essential for manipulation tasks, enabling safe action selection through pre-execution trajectory evaluation.

Method: Spatial-temporal transformer with MaskGIT-style masked prediction for multimodal future prediction; contact encoded as depth-weighted Gaussian splat images; vision-language model rejection sampling for safety checking.

Result: Model preserves spatial coherence during non-contact motion and generates plausible contact predictions; LLM-based judge successfully distinguishes collision from non-collision trajectories.

Conclusion: ChronoDreamer introduces a novel approach to robotic manipulation world modeling with integrated contact-aware visual predictions, leveraging physics-based synthetic data and vision-language model safety evaluation for action selection.

Abstract: We present ChronoDreamer, an action-conditioned world model for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Given a history of egocentric RGB frames, contact maps, actions, and joint states, ChronoDreamer predicts future video frames, contact distributions, and joint angles via a spatial-temporal transformer trained with MaskGIT-style masked prediction. Contact is encoded as depth-weighted Gaussian splat images that render 3D forces into a camera-aligned format suitable for vision backbones. At inference, predicted rollouts are evaluated by a vision-language model that reasons about collision likelihood, enabling rejection sampling of unsafe actions before execution. We train and evaluate on DreamerBench, a simulation dataset generated with Project Chrono that provides synchronized RGB, contact splat, proprioception, and physics annotations across rigid and deformable object scenarios. Qualitative results demonstrate that the model preserves spatial coherence during non-contact motion and generates plausible contact predictions, while the LLM-based judge distinguishes collision from non-collision trajectories.

TL;DR: ASTIF is a hybrid system for cryptocurrency price forecasting that integrates semantic and temporal data through adaptive meta-learning to outperform deep learning baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial forecasting models rely on static architectures and neglect semantic drivers like policy uncertainty, limiting their ability to adapt to rapid market shifts.

Method: Proposes ASTIF with three components: a dual-channel Small Language Model for semantic cues, a hybrid LSTM Random Forest for temporal dependencies, and a confidence-aware meta-learner for adaptive inference.

Result: ASTIF outperforms leading models (e.g., Informer, TFT) on AI-focused cryptocurrencies and tech stocks from 2020–2024, with ablation studies confirming the meta-learner's critical role in risk mitigation.

Conclusion: The research provides a scalable, knowledge-based solution for integrating quantitative and qualitative data in non-stationary financial environments.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is fundamentally an information fusion challenge, yet most existing models rely on static architectures that struggle to integrate heterogeneous knowledge sources or adjust to rapid regime shifts. Conventional approaches, relying exclusively on historical price sequences, often neglect the semantic drivers of volatility such as policy uncertainty and market narratives. To address these limitations, we propose the ASTIF (Adaptive Semantic-Temporal Integration for Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting), a hybrid intelligent system that adapts its forecasting strategy in real time through confidence-based meta-learning. The framework integrates three complementary components. A dual-channel Small Language Model using MirrorPrompt extracts semantic market cues alongside numerical trends. A hybrid LSTM Random Forest model captures sequential temporal dependencies. A confidence-aware meta-learner functions as an adaptive inference layer, modulating each predictor's contribution based on its real-time uncertainty.
  Experimental evaluation on a diverse dataset of AI-focused cryptocurrencies and major technology stocks from 2020 to 2024 shows that ASTIF outperforms leading deep learning and Transformer baselines (e.g., Informer, TFT). The ablation studies further confirm the critical role of the adaptive meta-learning mechanism, which successfully mitigates risk by shifting reliance between semantic and temporal channels during market turbulence. The research contributes a scalable, knowledge-based solution for fusing quantitative and qualitative data in non-stationary environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A key issue in cognitive science concerns the fundamental psychological processes that underlie the formation and retrieval of multiple types of concepts in short-term and long-term memory

Method: in-principle demonstrations, simulations of subjective conceptual spaces, comparison with deep-learning model

Result: CogAct automatically adapts to learn a range of categories from simple logical functions to natural raw concepts, outperforming other models; offers novel ways of designing human benchmarks; captures humans subjective judgements in music

Conclusion: Our approach may also be used in psychological applications that move away from modelling the average participant and towards capturing subjective concept space.

Abstract: A key issue in cognitive science concerns the fundamental psychological processes that underlie the formation and retrieval of multiple types of concepts in short-term and long-term memory (STM and LTM, respectively). We propose that chunking mechanisms play an essential role and show how the CogAct computational model grounds concept learning in fundamental cognitive processes and structures (such as chunking, attention, STM and LTM). First are the in-principle demonstrations, with CogAct automatically adapting to learn a range of categories from simple logical functions, to artificial categories, to natural raw (as opposed to natural pre-processed) concepts in the dissimilar domains of literature, chess and music. This kind of adaptive learning is difficult for most other psychological models, e.g., with cognitive models stopping at modelling artificial categories and (non-GPT) models based on deep learning requiring task-specific changes to the architecture. Secondly, we offer novel ways of designing human benchmarks for concept learning experiments and simulations accounting for subjectivity, ways to control for individual human experiences, all while keeping to real-life complex categories. We ground CogAct in simulations of subjective conceptual spaces of individual human participants, capturing humans subjective judgements in music, with the models learning from raw music score data without bootstrapping to pre-built knowledge structures. The CogAct simulations are compared to those obtained by a deep-learning model. These findings integrate concept learning and adaptation to complexity into the broader theories of cognitive psychology. Our approach may also be used in psychological applications that move away from modelling the average participant and towards capturing subjective concept space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based tutors lack persistent representations of learner knowledge, hindering principled, transparent, and long-term support.

Method: Use a StateGraph Orchestrator to coordinate six specialized agents (skill assessment, learner profiling, graduated hinting, curriculum selection, spaced repetition, engagement monitoring) operating over a shared, versioned learner state.

Result: System provides auditable mastery updates, proficiency-aware hints, dependency-aware curriculum adaptation, and improved task success with graduated hints, validated via simulated learners.

Conclusion: IntelliCode combines persistent learner modeling, orchestrated multi-agent reasoning, and principled instructional design to enable transparent and reliable LLM-driven tutoring.

Abstract: LLM-based tutors are typically single-turn assistants that lack persistent representations of learner knowledge, making it difficult to provide principled, transparent, and long-term pedagogical support. We introduce IntelliCode, a multi-agent LLM tutoring system built around a centralized, versioned learner state that integrates mastery estimates, misconceptions, review schedules, and engagement signals. A StateGraph Orchestrator coordinates six specialized agents: skill assessment, learner profiling, graduated hinting, curriculum selection, spaced repetition, and engagement monitoring, each operating as a pure transformation over the shared state under a single-writer policy. This architecture enables auditable mastery updates, proficiency-aware hints, dependency-aware curriculum adaptation, and safety-aligned prompting.
  The demo showcases an end-to-end tutoring workflow: a learner attempts a DSA problem, receives a conceptual hint when stuck, submits a corrected solution, and immediately sees mastery updates and a personalized review interval. We report validation results with simulated learners, showing stable state updates, improved task success with graduated hints, and diverse curriculum coverage. IntelliCode demonstrates how persistent learner modeling, orchestrated multi-agent reasoning, and principled instructional design can be combined to produce transparent and reliable LLM-driven tutoring.

TL;DR: This paper examines whether monkeys use objective reward differences or infer subjective valuations in social comparison, finding via computational models that objective comparisons (ECM) outperform subjective inference (IPM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It remains unknown how information about others' rewards affects self-reward evaluation from a computational perspective, motivating an investigation into whether primates recognize objective differences or infer subjective values.

Method: Developed three computational models (IPM, NCM, ECM) with varying social information processing, trained on monkey behavior data using a multi-layered, multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation, and evaluated classification via the Rand Index.

Result: The ECM achieved the highest classification score (Rand Index 0.88 vs. IPM 0.79), indicating social comparison relies more on objective reward differences than inferences about subjective states.

Conclusion: Social comparison in primates is primarily driven by objective reward differences rather than subjective valuation inferences, as supported by computational model comparisons.

Abstract: Social comparison -- the process of evaluating one's rewards relative to others -- plays a fundamental role in primate social cognition. However, it remains unknown from a computational perspective how information about others' rewards affects the evaluation of one's own reward. With a constructive approach, this study examines whether monkeys merely recognize objective reward differences or, instead, infer others' subjective reward valuations. We developed three computational models with varying degrees of social information processing: an Internal Prediction Model (IPM), which infers the partner's subjective values; a No Comparison Model (NCM), which disregards partner information; and an External Comparison Model (ECM), which directly incorporates the partner's objective rewards. To test model performance, we used a multi-layered, multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation. We trained the models on a dataset containing the behavior of a pair of monkeys, their rewards, and the conditioned stimuli. Then, we evaluated the models' ability to classify subjective values across pre-defined experimental conditions. The ECM achieved the highest classification score in the Rand Index (0.88 vs. 0.79 for the IPM) under our settings, suggesting that social comparison relies on objective reward differences rather than inferences about subjective states.

TL;DR: KeenKT uses Normal-Inverse-Gaussian distributions to model student knowledge states, addressing ambiguity in mastery judgment through novel attention and loss functions, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current Knowledge Tracing methods rely on single-point estimates, which cannot distinguish true ability from outburst or carelessness, leading to ambiguity in judging student mastery levels.

Method: Representing each student's knowledge state at each interaction using a Normal-Inverse-Gaussian (NIG) distribution, employing an NIG-distance-based attention mechanism for dynamic state evolution, and using a diffusion-based denoising reconstruction loss and distributional contrastive learning loss for enhanced robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on six public datasets show KeenKT outperforms SOTA KT models in prediction accuracy and sensitivity to behavioral fluctuations, with maximum AUC improvement of 5.85% and maximum ACC improvement of 6.89%.

Conclusion: KeenKT effectively addresses the ambiguity in judging student mastery by modeling knowledge states with NIG distributions, outperforms SOTA models in prediction accuracy and sensitivity to behavioral fluctuations, and achieves significant improvements in AUC and ACC metrics.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to dynamically model a student's mastery of knowledge concepts based on their historical learning interactions. Most current methods rely on single-point estimates, which cannot distinguish true ability from outburst or carelessness, creating ambiguity in judging mastery. To address this issue, we propose a Knowledge Mastery-State Disambiguation for Knowledge Tracing model (KeenKT), which represents a student's knowledge state at each interaction using a Normal-Inverse-Gaussian (NIG) distribution, thereby capturing the fluctuations in student learning behaviors. Furthermore, we design an NIG-distance-based attention mechanism to model the dynamic evolution of the knowledge state. In addition, we introduce a diffusion-based denoising reconstruction loss and a distributional contrastive learning loss to enhance the model's robustness. Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that KeenKT outperforms SOTA KT models in terms of prediction accuracy and sensitivity to behavioral fluctuations. The proposed method yields the maximum AUC improvement of 5.85% and the maximum ACC improvement of 6.89%.

*Chainarong Amornbunchornvej*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A geometric framework models conceptual learning as basis extension under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion, linking imagination and innovation to residual errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structural conditions under which the representational basis can expand in a principled and selective way, beyond fixed belief updating.

Method: Proposes a geometric framework where conceptual growth is modeled as admissible basis extension evaluated under MDL, with experience as vectors and restrictions to low-rank, admissible transformations.

Result: MDL-accepted extensions lie within the residual span from experience, rejecting orthogonal extensions; imaginary counterfactuals contribute only by exposing structured residual error, not arbitrary novelty.

Conclusion: The framework characterizes conceptual development as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process of basis extension, clarifying the role and limits of imagination.

Abstract: Concept learning becomes possible only when existing representations fail to account for experience. Most models of learning and inference, however, presuppose a fixed representational basis within which belief updating occurs. In this paper, I address a prior question: under what structural conditions can the representational basis itself expand in a principled and selective way?
  I propose a geometric framework in which conceptual growth is modeled as admissible basis extension evaluated under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Experience, whether externally observed or internally simulated, is represented as vectors relative to a current conceptual subspace. Residual components capture systematic representational failure, and candidate conceptual extensions are restricted to low-rank, admissible transformations. I show that any MDL-accepted extension can be chosen so that its novel directions lie entirely within the residual span induced by experience, while extensions orthogonal to this span strictly increase description length and are therefore rejected.
  This yields a conservative account of imagination and conceptual innovation. Internally generated counterfactual representations contribute to learning only insofar as they expose or amplify structured residual error, and cannot introduce arbitrary novelty. I further distinguish representational counterfactuals--counterfactuals over an agent's conceptual basis--from causal or value-level counterfactuals, and show how MDL provides a normative selection principle governing representational change.
  Overall, the framework characterizes conceptual development as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process of basis extension, clarifying both the role and the limits of imagination in learning and theory change.

### [29] [MEEA: Mere Exposure Effect-Driven Confrontational Optimization for LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18755)
*Jianyi Zhang,Shizhao Liu,Ziyin Zhou,Zhen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEEA is a psychology-inspired automated jailbreak attack that uses repeated low-toxicity semantic exposure to gradually erode LLM safety alignment through multi-turn interactions, achieving 20% higher attack success rates than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak studies assume static safety boundaries and fail to account for how contextual interactions dynamically influence model behavior, leading to limited stability and generalization.

Method: MEEA constructs semantically progressive prompt chains and optimizes them using simulated annealing guided by semantic similarity, toxicity, and jailbreak effectiveness, leveraging the mere exposure effect.

Result: Extensive experiments on GPT-4, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-R1 show MEEA consistently achieves higher attack success rates than seven baselines, with average ASR improvement exceeding 20%.

Conclusion: LLM safety behavior is inherently dynamic and history-dependent, challenging static alignment assumptions and highlighting the need for interaction-aware safety evaluation and defense mechanisms.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about the robustness of their safety alignment. While existing jailbreak studies explore both single-turn and multi-turn strategies, most implicitly assume a static safety boundary and fail to account for how contextual interactions dynamically influence model behavior, leading to limited stability and generalization. Motivated by this gap, we propose MEEA (Mere Exposure Effect Attack), a psychology-inspired, fully automated black-box framework for evaluating multi-turn safety robustness, grounded in the mere exposure effect. MEEA leverages repeated low-toxicity semantic exposure to induce a gradual shift in a model's effective safety threshold, enabling progressive erosion of alignment constraints over sustained interactions. Concretely, MEEA constructs semantically progressive prompt chains and optimizes them using a simulated annealing strategy guided by semantic similarity, toxicity, and jailbreak effectiveness. Extensive experiments on both closed-source and open-source models, including GPT-4, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate that MEEA consistently achieves higher attack success rates than seven representative baselines, with an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) improvement exceeding 20%. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of both annealing-based optimization and contextual exposure mechanisms. Beyond improved attack effectiveness, our findings indicate that LLM safety behavior is inherently dynamic and history-dependent, challenging the common assumption of static alignment boundaries and highlighting the need for interaction-aware safety evaluation and defense mechanisms.

### [30] [The Dead Salmons of AI Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18792)
*Maxime Méloux,Giada Dirupo,François Portet,Maxime Peyrard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study highlights the risk of false discoveries in AI interpretability, similar to a 'dead salmon' neuroscience artifact, and proposes reframing explanations as statistical parameters to improve rigor in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reports of misleading artifacts in AI interpretability methods, such as feature attribution or causal analyses producing plausible explanations for random neural networks, inspire a need for a more rigorous, statistical-causal framework to prevent false discoveries and enhance scientific reliability.

Method: The paper examines the phenomenon through a pragmatic statistical-causal reframing, treating explanations as parameters inferred from computational traces, testing findings against meaningful alternative hypotheses, and quantifying uncertainty with statistical models.

Result: The analysis reveals theoretical issues like identifiability in interpretability queries, emphasizing susceptibility to false discoveries and poor generalizability, while positioning interpretability as part of standard statistical inference to increase rigor.

Conclusion: By situating interpretability within statistical inference, the work opens promising avenues for turning AI interpretability into a pragmatic and rigorous science, addressing key limitations and enhancing the field's reliability.

Abstract: In a striking neuroscience study, the authors placed a dead salmon in an MRI scanner and showed it images of humans in social situations. Astonishingly, standard analyses of the time reported brain regions predictive of social emotions. The explanation, of course, was not supernatural cognition but a cautionary tale about misapplied statistical inference. In AI interpretability, reports of similar ''dead salmon'' artifacts abound: feature attribution, probing, sparse auto-encoding, and even causal analyses can produce plausible-looking explanations for randomly initialized neural networks. In this work, we examine this phenomenon and argue for a pragmatic statistical-causal reframing: explanations of computational systems should be treated as parameters of a (statistical) model, inferred from computational traces. This perspective goes beyond simply measuring statistical variability of explanations due to finite sampling of input data; interpretability methods become statistical estimators, and findings should be tested against explicit and meaningful alternative computational hypotheses, with uncertainty quantified with respect to the postulated statistical model. It also highlights important theoretical issues, such as the identifiability of common interpretability queries, which we argue is critical to understand the field's susceptibility to false discoveries, poor generalizability, and high variance. More broadly, situating interpretability within the standard toolkit of statistical inference opens promising avenues for future work aimed at turning AI interpretability into a pragmatic and rigorous science.

*Aditya Siddhant*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes HARBOR, a specialized LLM for behavioral health risk scoring, achieving 69% accuracy, and releases the PEARL dataset for benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of multimodal, temporal behavioral healthcare risk assessment where general-purpose LLMs underperform in structured clinical risk scoring.

Method: The method involves developing HARBOR, a specialized language model for behavioral healthcare, trained on the novel PEARL dataset, and benchmarking it against traditional ML models and proprietary LLMs.

Result: HARBOR achieves 69% accuracy in predicting Harbor Risk Scores, outperforming logistic regression (54%) and the strongest proprietary LLM baseline (29%).

Conclusion: The paper concludes that multimodal, behaviorally-aware language models like HARBOR offer a promising direction for clinical risk assessment, bridging the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific structured risk scoring.

Abstract: Behavioral healthcare risk assessment remains a challenging problem due to the highly multimodal nature of patient data and the temporal dynamics of mood and affective disorders. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, their effectiveness in structured clinical risk scoring remains unclear. In this work, we introduce HARBOR, a behavioral health aware language model designed to predict a discrete mood and risk score, termed the Harbor Risk Score (HRS), on an integer scale from -3 (severe depression) to +3 (mania). We also release PEARL, a longitudinal behavioral healthcare dataset spanning four years of monthly observations from three patients, containing physiological, behavioral, and self reported mental health signals. We benchmark traditional machine learning models, proprietary LLMs, and HARBOR across multiple evaluation settings and ablations. Our results show that HARBOR outperforms classical baselines and off the shelf LLMs, achieving 69 percent accuracy compared to 54 percent for logistic regression and 29 percent for the strongest proprietary LLM baseline.

### [32] [CORE: Concept-Oriented Reinforcement for Bridging the Definition-Application Gap in Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18857)
*Zijun Gao,Zhikun Xu,Xiao Ye,Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CORE is an RL framework that uses explicit concepts to fine-tune LLMs, improving their ability to apply concepts in math problem-solving beyond just pattern recognition, leading to gains on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle with genuine conceptual understanding in math, as current RLVR pipelines focus on final answers and reinforce pattern reuse rather than conceptual reasoning.

Method: CORE synthesizes concept-aligned quizzes, injects brief concept snippets during rollouts to elicit concept-primed trajectories, and reinforces reasoning via trajectory replacement or KL constraints/GRPO on concept-aligned quizzes, using a high-quality textbook resource.

Result: CORE shows consistent gains over baselines on in-domain concept-exercise suites and diverse out-of-domain math benchmarks across multiple models.

Conclusion: CORE provides fine-grained conceptual supervision that bridges problem-solving competence and genuine conceptual reasoning in a verifier-agnostic way, uniting direct training and rollouts under outcome regularization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve challenging math exercises yet fail to apply the concept right when the problem requires genuine understanding. Popular Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines reinforce final answers but provide little fine-grained conceptual signal, so models improve at pattern reuse rather than conceptual applications. We introduce CORE (Concept-Oriented REinforcement), an RL training framework that turns explicit concepts into a controllable supervision signal. Starting from a high-quality, low-contamination textbook resource that links verifiable exercises to concise concept descriptions, we run a sanity probe showing LLMs can restate definitions but fail concept-linked quizzes, quantifying the conceptual reasoning gap. CORE then (i) synthesizes concept-aligned quizzes, (ii) injects brief concept snippets during rollouts to elicit concept-primed trajectories, and (iii) reinforces conceptual reasoning via trajectory replacement after group failures, a lightweight forward-KL constraint that aligns unguided with concept-primed policies, or standard GRPO directly on concept-aligned quizzes. Across several models, CORE delivers consistent gains over vanilla and SFT baselines on both in-domain concept-exercise suites and diverse out-of-domain math benchmarks. CORE unifies direct training on concept-aligned quizzes and concept-injected rollouts under outcome regularization. It provides fine-grained conceptual supervision that bridges problem-solving competence and genuine conceptual reasoning, while remaining algorithm- and verifier-agnostic.

TL;DR: Expert-guided Bayesian network fusing multiple vision model outputs significantly improves automated triage performance in mass casualty incidents, achieving near 3x accuracy improvement over vision-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass Casualty Incidents can overwhelm emergency medical systems, leading to delays or errors in casualty assessment that result in preventable deaths. There's a need for improved automated triage systems to support emergency responders.

Method: A decision support framework that fuses outputs from multiple computer vision models (estimating signs of severe hemorrhage, respiratory distress, physical alertness, or visible trauma) into a Bayesian network constructed entirely from expert-defined rules.

Result: In DARPA Triage Challenge field scenarios with 11 and 9 casualties respectively, the Bayesian network model substantially outperformed vision-only baselines. Physiological assessment accuracy improved from 15% to 42% (first scenario) and 19% to 46% (second scenario). Overall triage accuracy increased from 14% to 53%, and diagnostic coverage expanded from 31% to 95% of cases requiring assessment.

Conclusion: The expert-knowledge-guided Bayesian network framework demonstrates superior performance over vision-only baselines, achieving a nearly threefold increase in physiological assessment accuracy and substantially higher triage accuracy with expanded diagnostic coverage. This approach offers a promising solution for supporting emergency responders in mass casualty incidents.

Abstract: Mass Casualty Incidents can overwhelm emergency medical systems and resulting delays or errors in the assessment of casualties can lead to preventable deaths. We present a decision support framework that fuses outputs from multiple computer vision models, estimating signs of severe hemorrhage, respiratory distress, physical alertness, or visible trauma, into a Bayesian network constructed entirely from expert-defined rules. Unlike traditional data-driven models, our approach does not require training data, supports inference with incomplete information, and is robust to noisy or uncertain observations. We report performance for two missions involving 11 and 9 casualties, respectively, where our Bayesian network model substantially outperformed vision-only baselines during evaluation of our system in the DARPA Triage Challenge (DTC) field scenarios. The accuracy of physiological assessment improved from 15% to 42% in the first scenario and from 19% to 46% in the second, representing nearly threefold increase in performance. More importantly, overall triage accuracy increased from 14% to 53% in all patients, while the diagnostic coverage of the system expanded from 31% to 95% of the cases requiring assessment. These results demonstrate that expert-knowledge-guided probabilistic reasoning can significantly enhance automated triage systems, offering a promising approach to supporting emergency responders in MCIs. This approach enabled Team Chiron to achieve 4th place out of 11 teams during the 1st physical round of the DTC.

*Li Yan,Bolun Liu,Chao Li,Jing Liang,Kunjie Yu,Caitong Yue,Xuzhao Chai,Boyang Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new dynamic multimodal multiobjective optimization algorithm using autoencoder-based clustering and adaptive niching outperforms existing methods in maintaining diversity and achieving convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms neglect solution modality, and static multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms lack adaptability to dynamic changes, creating a gap in handling dynamic multimodal multiobjective optimization.

Method: A Clustering-based Autoencoder prediction dynamic response mechanism that uses an autoencoder to process matched clusters for generating diverse initial populations, combined with an adaptive niching strategy for balancing convergence and diversity.

Result: Empirical analysis on 12 test function instances shows the algorithm preserves population diversity more effectively in decision space and achieves superior convergence in objective space compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively addresses the dual challenge of tracking multiple Pareto optimal sets and maintaining diversity in dynamic multimodal multiobjective optimization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both decision and objective spaces.

Abstract: Dynamic multimodal multiobjective optimization presents the dual challenge of simultaneously tracking multiple equivalent pareto optimal sets and maintaining population diversity in time-varying environments. However, existing dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms often neglect solution modality, whereas static multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms lack adaptability to dynamic changes. To address above challenge, this paper makes two primary contributions. First, we introduce a new benchmark suite of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions constructed by fusing the properties of both dynamic and multimodal optimization to establish a rigorous evaluation platform. Second, we propose a novel algorithm centered on a Clustering-based Autoencoder prediction dynamic response mechanism, which utilizes an autoencoder model to process matched clusters to generate a highly diverse initial population. Furthermore, to balance the algorithm's convergence and diversity, we integrate an adaptive niching strategy into the static optimizer. Empirical analysis on 12 instances of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions reveals that, compared with several state-of-the-art dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, our algorithm not only preserves population diversity more effectively in the decision space but also achieves superior convergence in the objective space.

*Yizhi Wang,Linan Yue,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework called SynSelect is proposed to generate high-quality long CoT data for multimodal reasoning tasks, enhancing model performance and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending the success of Large Reasoning Models from complex reasoning to multimodal reasoning is challenging due to the increased complexity of integrating diverse input modalities and the scarcity of high-quality long CoT training data. Existing datasets and synthesis methods have limitations like limited reasoning depth, modality conversion errors, and rigid generation pipelines.

Method: A three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework: first leverages multiple heterogeneous multimodal LRMs to produce diverse candidate CoTs, and then applies both instance and batch level selection to filter high-quality CoTs that enhance reasoning capabilities.

Result: Models supervised fine-tuned on SynSelect-generated data significantly outperform baselines on multiple multimodal benchmarks and achieve further improvements after reinforcement learning post-training.

Conclusion: SynSelect is an effective approach for generating high-quality long CoT data, advancing multimodal LRMs reasoning capabilities and validating its impact on model performance.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Extending these successes to multimodal reasoning remains challenging due to the increased complexity of integrating diverse input modalities and the scarcity of high-quality long CoT training data. Existing multimodal datasets and CoT synthesis methods still suffer from limited reasoning depth, modality conversion errors, and rigid generation pipelines, hindering model performance and stability. To this end, in this paper, we propose SynSelect, a novel three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework for generating high-quality long CoT data tailored to multimodal reasoning tasks. Specifically, SynSelect first leverages multiple heterogeneous multimodal LRMs to produce diverse candidate CoTs, and then applies both instance and batch level selection to filter high-quality CoTs that can effectively enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models supervised fine-tuned on SynSelect-generated data significantly outperform baselines and achieve further improvements after reinforcement learning post-training. Our results validate SynSelect as an effective approach for advancing multimodal LRMs reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: A novel OR-Guided 'Pretrain-then-Reinforce' framework integrates AI and OR for inventory management, achieving significant real-world improvements in turnover, in-stock rates, and holding costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between AI's adaptive perception and OR's structural rigor in handling complex inventory systems.

Method: The method involves a simulation-augmented OR model to generate high-quality reference decisions, a domain-informed deep learning foundation model trained on these decisions, and a reinforcement learning fine-tuning stage that aligns with OR optimality principles.

Result: The model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, with a 5.27-day reduction in turnover, a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, and a 29.95% decrease in holding costs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a lightweight, domain-informed model guided by structured OR logic can achieve state-of-the-art performance and robust transferability, offering a scalable and cost-effective paradigm for intelligent supply chain management.

Abstract: As the pursuit of synergy between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) gains momentum in handling complex inventory systems, a critical challenge persists: how to effectively reconcile AI's adaptive perception with OR's structural rigor. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel OR-Guided "Pretrain-then-Reinforce" framework. To provide structured guidance, we propose a simulation-augmented OR model that generates high-quality reference decisions, implicitly capturing complex business constraints and managerial preferences. Leveraging these OR-derived decisions as foundational training labels, we design a domain-informed deep learning foundation model to establish foundational decision-making capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning stage. Uniquely, we position RL as a deep alignment mechanism that enables the AI agent to internalize the optimality principles of OR, while simultaneously leveraging exploration for general policy refinement and allowing expert guidance for scenario-specific adaptation (e.g., promotional events). Validated through extensive numerical experiments and a field deployment at JD.com augmented by a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, our model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, delivering real-world gains of a 5.27-day reduction in turnover and a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, alongside a 29.95% decrease in holding costs. Contrary to the prevailing trend of brute-force model scaling, our study demonstrates that a lightweight, domain-informed model can deliver state-of-the-art performance and robust transferability when guided by structured OR logic. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective paradigm for intelligent supply chain management, highlighting the value of deeply aligning AI with OR.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recontextualization reduces specification gaming in language models by training them to resist misbehaviors that misspecified training signals reinforce, without improving the supervision signal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers often struggle to specify correct training labels and rewards, leading to language models 'gaming' training signals and performing misbehaviors that these signals mistakenly reinforce.

Method: The method involves generating completions from prompts that discourage misbehavior and then recontextualizing them as if they were responses to prompts that permit misbehavior, thereby training models to resist misbehavior even when instructions allow it.

Result: Recontextualization prevents models from learning to: 1) prioritize evaluation metrics over chat response quality; 2) special-case code to pass incorrect tests; 3) lie to users; and 4) become sycophantic.

Conclusion: Recontextualization effectively mitigates specification gaming in language models by training them to resist misbehaviors that misspecified training signals might otherwise reinforce, without requiring improvements to the supervision signal itself.

Abstract: Developers often struggle to specify correct training labels and rewards. Perhaps they don't need to. We propose recontextualization, which reduces how often language models "game" training signals, performing misbehaviors those signals mistakenly reinforce. We show recontextualization prevents models from learning to 1) prioritize evaluation metrics over chat response quality; 2) special-case code to pass incorrect tests; 3) lie to users; and 4) become sycophantic. Our method works by generating completions from prompts discouraging misbehavior and then recontextualizing them as though they were in response to prompts permitting misbehavior. Recontextualization trains language models to resist misbehavior even when instructions permit it. This mitigates the reinforcement of misbehavior from misspecified training signals, reducing specification gaming without improving the supervision signal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs on resource-constrained devices is difficult due to high memory demands, and existing reduction methods like quantization require extensive experimentation and infrastructure design.

Method: Leverage existing techniques to extract steering vectors (representing high-level concepts) from larger models and transfer them to smaller models during inference, with inference-time scaling to dynamically adjust steering intensity.

Result: Extensive experimentation shows effective transferability of concepts to smaller models (e.g., Phi, Llama, Qwen) across tasks, and inference-time scaling improves accuracy by 7-15% for Qwen3-0.6B.

Conclusion: Steering vectors can be efficiently transferred to enhance small model performance, offering a practical solution for deployment on resource-constrained devices with reduced experimental overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at diverse tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging. Existing methods like quantization, pruning, and distillation can reduce memory footprint but often demand extensive experimentation and careful infrastructure design. Leveraging existing techniques for extracting high-level concepts (represented as steering vectors) from larger models, we investigate their transferability to smaller language models (SLM) during inference. We demonstrate through extensive experimentation that these concepts can be effectively transferred to smaller models, irrespective of their family (e.g., Phi, Llama, Qwen), leading to performance improvements across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, we introduce inference-time scaling to enhance performance by dynamically adjusting the steering intensity which has resulted in a 7-15\% of accuracy improvement for Qwen3-0.6B.

TL;DR: Population-Evolve is a novel training-free method that employs a Genetic Algorithm inspired approach, enabling a Large Language Model (LLM) to self-evolve candidate solutions through parallel reasoning and majority voting, demonstrating computational efficiency and superior accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference without additional training. The motivation stems from the emergence of test-time scaling as a promising direction for improving LLM reasoning, and the authors aim to leverage evolutionary strategies to optimize this process efficiently and effectively.

Method: The proposed method, Population-Evolve, is inspired by Genetic Algorithms. It maintains a dynamic population of candidate solutions for each problem using parallel reasoning.

Result: Empirical results show that Population-Evolve achieves superior accuracy in reasoning tasks, exhibits low performance variance, and maintains computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The study concludes that Population-Evolve effectively enhances LLM reasoning through evolutionary strategies, highlighting the potential of such approaches to unlock the reasoning power of LLMs during inference, as evidenced by improved accuracy, reduced variance, and efficient computation.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising direction for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in last few years. In this work, we propose Population-Evolve, a training-free method inspired by Genetic Algorithms to optimize LLM reasoning. Our approach maintains a dynamic population of candidate solutions for each problem via parallel reasoning. By incorporating an evolve prompt, the LLM self-evolves its population in all iterations. Upon convergence, the final answer is derived via majority voting. Furthermore, we establish a unification framework that interprets existing test-time scaling strategies through the lens of genetic algorithms. Empirical results demonstrate that Population-Evolve achieves superior accuracy with low performance variance and computational efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of evolutionary strategies to unlock the reasoning power of LLMs during inference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper connects attention mechanisms in ML to promise theory, bridging vectorized learning and knowledge graphs without language models. It emphasizes statistical stability (trust) in data and uses Semantic Spacetime graphs for feature classification, enabling reasoning under uncertainty with significant data compression for applications like robotics and emergency services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between vectorized Machine Learning and Knowledge Graph representations without relying on language models, and to enable reasoning under uncertainty with efficient data compression for practical applications.

Method: Uses promise theory to model attention semantics and dynamics, and employs Semantic Spacetime γ(3,4) graphs for feature classification by their roles in semantic processes, avoiding complex ontologies.

Result: The approach allows meaningful coexistence of learning networks and knowledge graphs, preserving different data aspects: vectors for probabilistic estimation and graphs for intentionality. It enables reasoning under uncertainty with orders of magnitude data compression.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms can be effectively modeled using promise theory, creating a bridge between ML and knowledge graphs. The Semantic Spacetime approach provides efficient context determination with significant data compression, beneficial for autonomous systems and emergency services.

Abstract: The semantics and dynamics of `attention' are closely related to promise theoretic notions developed for autonomous agents and can thus easily be written down in promise framework. In this way one may establish a bridge between vectorized Machine Learning and Knowledge Graph representations without relying on language models implicitly. Our expectations for knowledge presume a degree of statistical stability, i.e. average invariance under repeated observation, or `trust' in the data. Both learning networks and knowledge graph representations can meaningfully coexist to preserve different aspects of data. While vectorized data are useful for probabilistic estimation, graphs preserve the intentionality of the source even under data fractionation. Using a Semantic Spacetime $γ(3,4)$ graph, one avoids complex ontologies in favour of classification of features by their roles in semantic processes. The latter favours an approach to reasoning under conditions of uncertainty. Appropriate attention to causal boundary conditions may lead to orders of magnitude compression of data required for such context determination, as required in the contexts of autonomous robotics, defence deployments, and ad hoc emergency services.

Motivation: Large language models excel at language reasoning but struggle with accurate computation, necessitating a hybrid approach to link language reasoning and symbolic calculation for bilingual mathematical problem solving.

Method: The paper proposes HERALD, which integrates NuminaMath-7B-TIR, GPT-4o, and Mistral-7B with adaptive routing, tool-based reinforcement learning, and knowledge distillation. It includes confidence calibration for stable weighting and dual-path checking for result correctness.

Result: HERALD demonstrates improved accuracy, stability, and clarity in multilingual mathematical reasoning by combining symbolic checking, adaptive ensembles, and bilingual fine-tuning.

Conclusion: HERALD provides a practical solution for fluent reasoning and precise calculation in bilingual mathematical tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of hybrid ensemble methods.

Abstract: Bilingual mathematical problem solving needs a clear link between language reasoning and symbolic calculation. Large language models often handle language well but are weak in accurate computation. This paper presents HERALD (Hybrid Ensemble Reasoning with Adaptive Learning and Distillation), a framework that joins reasoning and calculation using NuminaMath-7B-TIR, GPT-4o, and Mistral-7B. HERALD uses adaptive routing, tool-based reinforcement learning, and knowledge distillation to connect different reasoning paths. Confidence calibration keeps weighting stable, and dual-path checking keeps results correct. Reinforcement learning controls tool use to cut redundancy, and distillation lowers delay without hurting accuracy. The system shows that combining symbolic checking, adaptive ensembles, and bilingual fine-tuning helps achieve both fluent reasoning and precise calculation. HERALD offers a practical solution for multilingual mathematical reasoning with better accuracy, stability, and clarity.

Method: Developed a new conditioning rule for Accept-Desirability models based on indifferences introduced by observing events, using an abstract framework with general linear spaces and projection operators, and applied it to verify AGM axioms for belief revision.

Result: Conditioning rule established in an abstract setting unifies classical and quantum probabilities, with all AGM axioms shown to hold in two special cases: classical propositional logic and full conditional probabilities.

Conclusion: The framework successfully generalizes conditioning for Accept-Desirability models, maintaining AGM axioms in key cases, contributing to abstract decision-making theory with potential applications in imprecise probabilities and quantum settings.

Abstract: We discuss conditionalisation for Accept-Desirability models in an abstract decision-making framework, where uncertain rewards live in a general linear space, and events are special projection operators on that linear space. This abstract setting allows us to unify classical and quantum probabilities, and extend them to an imprecise probabilities context. We introduce a new conditioning rule for our Accept-Desirability models, based on the idea that observing an event introduces new indifferences between options. We associate a belief revision operator with our conditioning rule, and investigate which of the AGM axioms for belief revision still hold in our more general framework. We investigate two interesting special cases where all of these axioms are shown to still hold: classical propositional logic and full conditional probabilities.

### [44] [FC-MIR: A Mobile Screen Awareness Framework for Intent-Aware Recommendation based on Frame-Compressed Multimodal Trajectory Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19107)
*Zhe Yang,Xiaoshuang Sheng,Zhengnan Zhang,Jidong Wu,Zexing Wang,Xin He,Shenghua Xu,Guanjing Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FC-MIR is a framework for mobile UI intent prediction that uses keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation to reduce computational costs. It integrates MLLMs for trajectory summarization and intent prediction, expands to operation suggestions, and is tested on a real-world dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time mobile deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models for UI intent understanding is limited by heavy computational costs and redundant frame processing.

Method: Propose FC-MIR framework with keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation to reduce visual redundancy. Integrate state-of-the-art MLLMs for trajectory summarization and intent prediction, and expand to generate post-prediction operations and search suggestions. Use a fine-grained evaluation metric. Construct a UI trajectory dataset from UI-Agents and real user interactions for assessment.

Result: The compression method retains performance at 50%-60% compression rates. MLLMs, both closed-source and fine-tuned, show strong intent summarization, supporting lightweight on-device deployment. However, they struggle with generating useful and 'surprising' suggestions.

Conclusion: FC-MIR effectively addresses efficiency issues in mobile UI intent prediction, with promising results for on-device deployment, but there is room for improvement in suggestion generation. Real-world deployment integrates UI perception and UI-Agent proxies to advance the field.

Abstract: Identifying user intent from mobile UI operation trajectories is critical for advancing UI understanding and enabling task automation agents. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at video understanding tasks, their real-time mobile deployment is constrained by heavy computational costs and inefficient redundant frame processing. To address these issues, we propose the FC-MIR framework: leveraging keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation, it cuts visual redundancy to boost inference efficiency, while integrating state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs or fine-tuned models (e.g., Qwen3-VL) for trajectory summarization and intent prediction. We further expand task scope to explore generating post-prediction operations and search suggestions, and introduce a fine-grained metric to evaluate the practical utility of summaries, predictions, and suggestions. For rigorous assessment, we construct a UI trajectory dataset covering scenarios from UI-Agents (Agent-I) and real user interactions (Person-I). Experimental results show our compression method retains performance at 50%-60% compression rates; both closed-source and fine-tuned MLLMs demonstrate strong intent summarization, supporting potential lightweight on-device deployment. However, MLLMs still struggle with useful and "surprising" suggestions, leaving room for improvement. Finally, we deploy the framework in a real-world setting, integrating UI perception and UI-Agent proxies to lay a foundation for future progress in this field.

*Chenghao Li,Chaoning Zhang,Yi Lu,Shuxu Chen,Xudong Wang,Jiaquan Zhang,Zhicheng Wang,Zhengxun Jin,Kuien Liu,Sung-Ho Bae,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,Hen Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes reasoning chains in LLMs from a structural perspective using topological data analysis (persistent homology) to assess quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies lack focus on the structural mechanisms of reasoning chains, despite their varying performance in complex problem-solving with LLMs.

Method: Apply persistent homology from TDA to map reasoning steps into semantic space, extract topological features (e.g., homology groups, barcodes), and analyze structural changes like connectivity and redundancy.

Result: Topological complexity of reasoning chains positively correlates with accuracy; more complex chains identify correct answers sooner, while successful reasoning shows simpler topologies (reduced redundancy/cycles).

Conclusion: The work provides a novel structural perspective for evaluating reasoning chain quality and offers optimization guidance for future LLM reasoning enhancements.

Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs), particularly with the introduction of the long reasoning chain technique, the reasoning ability of LLMs in complex problem-solving has been significantly enhanced. While acknowledging the power of long reasoning chains, we cannot help but wonder: Why do different reasoning chains perform differently in reasoning? What components of the reasoning chains play a key role? Existing studies mainly focus on evaluating reasoning chains from a functional perspective, with little attention paid to their structural mechanisms. To address this gap, this work is the first to analyze and evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from a structural perspective. We apply persistent homology from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to map reasoning steps into semantic space, extract topological features, and analyze structural changes. These changes reveal semantic coherence, logical redundancy, and identify logical breaks and gaps. By calculating homology groups, we assess connectivity and redundancy at various scales, using barcode and persistence diagrams to quantify stability and consistency. Our results show that the topological structural complexity of reasoning chains correlates positively with accuracy. More complex chains identify correct answers sooner, while successful reasoning exhibits simpler topologies, reducing redundancy and cycles, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. This work provides a new perspective on reasoning chain quality assessment and offers guidance for future optimization.

### [46] [Can We Test Consciousness Theories on AI? Ablations, Markers, and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19155)
*Yin Jun Phua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Artificial agents embodying consciousness theories (GWT, IIT, HOT) show these describe complementary functional layers: GWT provides broadcast capacity, HOT provides quality control, not competing accounts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The search for reliable indicators of consciousness has fragmented into competing theoretical camps (GWT, IIT, HOT), each proposing distinct neural signatures. The authors aim to test these theories by constructing artificial agents that embody their mechanisms.

Method: The authors adopt a synthetic neuro-phenomenology approach: constructing artificial agents that embody mechanisms from GWT, IIT, and HOT theories, and testing functional consequences through precise architectural ablations.

Result: Across three experiments, they report dissociations: 1) Ablating Self-Model (HOT) abolishes metacognitive calibration while preserving first-order task performance (synthetic blindsight). 2) Workspace capacity (GWT) is causally necessary for information access, with graded degradation. 3) GWT-style broadcasting amplifies internal noise, creating fragility, while B2 agents show robustness. They also report that raw perturbational complexity decreases under workspace bottleneck.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that Global Workspace Theory and Higher-Order Theories describe complementary functional layers, with GWT providing broadcast capacity and HOT providing quality control, rather than being competing accounts. They also caution against naive transfer of IIT-adjacent proxies to engineered agents.

Abstract: The search for reliable indicators of consciousness has fragmented into competing theoretical camps (Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and Higher-Order Theories (HOT)), each proposing distinct neural signatures. We adopt a synthetic neuro-phenomenology approach: constructing artificial agents that embody these mechanisms to test their functional consequences through precise architectural ablations impossible in biological systems. Across three experiments, we report dissociations suggesting these theories describe complementary functional layers rather than competing accounts. In Experiment 1, a no-rewire Self-Model lesion abolishes metacognitive calibration while preserving first-order task performance, yielding a synthetic blindsight analogue consistent with HOT predictions. In Experiment 2, workspace capacity proves causally necessary for information access: a complete workspace lesion produces qualitative collapse in access-related markers, while partial reductions show graded degradation, consistent with GWT's ignition framework. In Experiment 3, we uncover a broadcast-amplification effect: GWT-style broadcasting amplifies internal noise, creating extreme fragility. The B2 agent family is robust to the same latent perturbation; this robustness persists in a Self-Model-off / workspace-read control, cautioning against attributing the effect solely to $z_{\text{self}}$ compression. We also report an explicit negative result: raw perturbational complexity (PCI-A) decreases under the workspace bottleneck, cautioning against naive transfer of IIT-adjacent proxies to engineered agents. These results suggest a hierarchical design principle: GWT provides broadcast capacity, while HOT provides quality control. We emphasize that our agents are not conscious; they are reference implementations for testing functional predictions of consciousness theories.

### [47] [Observer, Not Player: Simulating Theory of Mind in LLMs through Game Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19210)
*Jerry Wang,Ting Yiu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An interactive framework to evaluate if LLMs genuinely 'understand' by testing their reasoning on Rock-Paper-Scissors strategies, using metrics like Union Loss for systematic assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe whether large language models (LLMs) can exhibit mind-like reasoning in sequential tasks like strategy recognition, beyond mere knowledge.

Method: LLM acts as Observer to identify strategies, benchmark with static/dynamic strategies, metrics: Cross-Entropy, Brier score, EV discrepancy, integrated as Union Loss, and Strategy Identification Rate.

Result: Framework provides interactive tools for real-time adjustments and visualization, capturing predictive accuracy and strategy identification stability.

Conclusion: Offers a practical, interpretable proxy for assessing LLM reasoning in sequential games, highlighting strengths and limitations.

Abstract: We present an interactive framework for evaluating whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit genuine "understanding" in a simple yet strategic environment. As a running example, we focus on Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), which, despite its apparent simplicity, requires sequential reasoning, adaptation, and strategy recognition. Our system positions the LLM as an Observer whose task is to identify which strategies are being played and to articulate the reasoning behind this judgment. The purpose is not to test knowledge of Rock-Paper-Scissors itself, but to probe whether the model can exhibit mind-like reasoning about sequential behavior. To support systematic evaluation, we provide a benchmark consisting of both static strategies and lightweight dynamic strategies specified by well-prompted rules. We quantify alignment between the Observer's predictions and the ground-truth distributions induced by actual strategy pairs using three complementary signals: Cross-Entropy, Brier score, and Expected Value (EV) discrepancy. These metrics are further integrated into a unified score, the Union Loss, which balances calibration, sensitivity, and payoff alignment. Together with a Strategy Identification Rate (SIR) metric, our framework captures not only predictive accuracy but also whether the model can stably identify the latent strategies in play. The demo emphasizes interactivity, transparency, and reproducibility. Users can adjust LLM distributions in real time, visualize losses as they evolve, and directly inspect reasoning snippets to identify where and why failures occur. In doing so, our system provides a practical and interpretable proxy for mind-like inference in sequential games, offering insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM reasoning.

*Valentin Schmidberger,Manuel Eberhardinger,Setareh Maghsudi,Johannes Maucher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs like Llama 3.1 8B and OpenCoder 8B can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data to generate executable rule-based plausibility checks for document forgery detection on constrained hardware, offering scalable automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document forgery threats require automated verification mechanisms; existing plausibility checks are manually implemented, which is time-consuming, and LLMs present potential for automation but face domain adaptation challenges.

Method: Fine-tune open-source LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B and OpenCoder 8B) on structured datasets from real-world scenarios and evaluate generated plausibility checks on unseen forgery patterns.

Result: The models generated executable and effective verification procedures for forgery detection.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential as scalable tools to support comprehensible human decision-making in security-sensitive contexts by automating plausibility check generation.

Abstract: Document forgery poses a growing threat to legal, economic, and governmental processes, requiring increasingly sophisticated verification mechanisms. One approach involves the use of plausibility checks, rule-based procedures that assess the correctness and internal consistency of data, to detect anomalies or signs of manipulation. Although these verification procedures are essential for ensuring data integrity, existing plausibility checks are manually implemented by software engineers, which is time-consuming. Recent advances in code generation with large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating and scaling the generation of these checks. However, adapting LLMs to the specific requirements of an unknown domain remains a significant challenge. This work investigates the extent to which LLMs, adapted on domain-specific code and data through different fine-tuning strategies, can generate rule-based plausibility checks for forgery detection on constrained hardware resources. We fine-tune open-source LLMs, Llama 3.1 8B and OpenCoder 8B, on structured datasets derived from real-world application scenarios and evaluate the generated plausibility checks on previously unseen forgery patterns. The results demonstrate that the models are capable of generating executable and effective verification procedures. This also highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable tools to support human decision-making in security-sensitive contexts where comprehensibility is required.

*Lingjun Mao,Jiawei Ren,Kun Zhou,Jixuan Chen,Ziqiao Ma,Lianhui Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeliveryBench is a city-scale embodied benchmark based on food delivery tasks, introduced to evaluate LLM and VLM agents in realistic, constraint-dense environments with long-horizon planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for embodied agents focus on simple short-term tasks and lack rich realistic constraints (e.g., delivery deadlines, transportation costs, battery life, social interactions) that are critical for real-world decision-making. This gap limits understanding of agents' performance in complex scenarios.

Method: Developed DeliveryBench as a procedurally generated 3D city simulation with diverse elements like road networks, buildings, functional locations, and transportation modes. It incorporates real-world constraints and long-horizon objectives to create environments for systematic agent evaluation. Human players are included as a baseline for comparison, testing various VLM-based agents across nine different cities to assess their planning and constraint management abilities.

Result: Results show a substantial performance gap between VLM-based agents and humans, with agents often being short-sighted and violating basic commonsense constraints. Different models exhibit distinct personalities (e.g., adventurous vs. conservative), highlighting both the brittleness and diversity of current agents in such environments. The benchmark enables detailed analysis of agent behaviors in constraint-dense settings.

Conclusion: DeliveryBench effectively captures the complexities of real-world embodied tasks and reveals significant limitations in current VLM-based agents, emphasizing the need for better constraint-aware, long-horizon planning in AI systems to align more closely with human performance in realistic environments.

Abstract: LLMs and VLMs are increasingly deployed as embodied agents, yet existing benchmarks largely revolve around simple short-term tasks and struggle to capture rich realistic constraints that shape real-world decision making. To close this gap, we propose DeliveryBench, a city-scale embodied benchmark grounded in the real-world profession of food delivery. Food couriers naturally operate under long-horizon objectives (maximizing net profit over hours) while managing diverse constraints, e.g., delivery deadline, transportation expense, vehicle battery, and necessary interactions with other couriers and customers. DeliveryBench instantiates this setting in procedurally generated 3D cities with diverse road networks, buildings, functional locations, transportation modes, and realistic resource dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of constraint-aware, long-horizon planning. We benchmark a range of VLM-based agents across nine cities and compare them with human players. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap to humans, and find that these agents are short-sighted and frequently break basic commonsense constraints. Additionally, we observe distinct personalities across models (e.g., adventurous GPT-5 vs. conservative Claude), highlighting both the brittleness and the diversity of current VLM-based embodied agents in realistic, constraint-dense environments. Our code, data, and benchmark are available at https://deliverybench.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frontier AI models possess the knowledge to solve challenging problems but lack the ability to know how, what, or when to apply it.

Method: Vibe Reasoning uses generic meta-prompts, agentic grounding, and model orchestration through agentic workflows with Python code execution and file-based memory.

Result: The solution derived the correct answer (2112) and a rigorous mathematical proof for IMO 2025 Problem 6, a combinatorial optimization problem where autonomous AI systems had previously failed.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Vibe Reasoning, a human-AI collaborative approach that combines GPT-5's exploratory abilities with Gemini 3 Pro's proof strengths to solve complex mathematical problems.

Abstract: We introduce Vibe Reasoning, a human-AI collaborative paradigm for solving complex mathematical problems. Our key insight is that frontier AI models already possess the knowledge required to solve challenging problems -- they simply do not know how, what, or when to apply it. Vibe Reasoning transforms AI's latent potential into manifested capability through generic meta-prompts, agentic grounding, and model orchestration. We demonstrate this paradigm through IMO 2025 Problem 6, a combinatorial optimization problem where autonomous AI systems publicly reported failures. Our solution combined GPT-5's exploratory capabilities with Gemini 3 Pro's proof strengths, leveraging agentic workflows with Python code execution and file-based memory, to derive both the correct answer (2112) and a rigorous mathematical proof. Through iterative refinement across multiple attempts, we discovered the necessity of agentic grounding and model orchestration, while human prompts evolved from problem-specific hints to generic, transferable meta-prompts. We analyze why capable AI fails autonomously, how each component addresses specific failure modes, and extract principles for effective vibe reasoning. Our findings suggest that lightweight human guidance can unlock frontier models' mathematical reasoning potential. This is ongoing work; we are developing automated frameworks and conducting broader evaluations to further validate Vibe Reasoning's generality and effectiveness.

TL;DR: Helios is a large language model designed for smart energy systems, addressing LLM limitations in this domain through specialized datasets and training, with proven improvements in knowledge, task accuracy, and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs lack domain knowledge and physical-constraint awareness in smart energy, hindering precise engineering-aligned inference and generation due to interdisciplinary, fragmented, and fast-evolving expertise.

Method: Develop Enersys, a multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end dataset construction, producing EnerBase (knowledge base), EnerInstruct (instruction fine-tuning dataset), and EnerReinforce (RLHF dataset). Then train Helios via large-scale pretraining, SFT, and RLHF.

Result: Helios shows significant enhancements in domain knowledge mastery, task execution accuracy, and alignment with human preferences, validated by EnerBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in smart energy scenarios.

Conclusion: Helios, with its tailored resources and training, effectively overcomes LLM limitations in the smart energy domain, advancing domain-specific AI capabilities for industrial transformation toward carbon neutrality.

Abstract: In the global drive toward carbon neutrality, deeply coordinated smart energy systems underpin industrial transformation. However, the interdisciplinary, fragmented, and fast-evolving expertise in this domain prevents general-purpose LLMs, which lack domain knowledge and physical-constraint awareness, from delivering precise engineering-aligned inference and generation. To address these challenges, we introduce Helios, a large language model tailored to the smart energy domain, together with a comprehensive suite of resources to advance LLM research in this field. Specifically, we develop Enersys, a multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end dataset construction, through which we produce: (1) a smart energy knowledge base, EnerBase, to enrich the model's foundational expertise; (2) an instruction fine-tuning dataset, EnerInstruct, to strengthen performance on domain-specific downstream tasks; and (3) an RLHF dataset, EnerReinforce, to align the model with human preferences and industry standards. Leveraging these resources, Helios undergoes large-scale pretraining, SFT, and RLHF. We also release EnerBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in smart energy scenarios, and demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances domain knowledge mastery, task execution accuracy, and alignment with human preferences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SafeMed-R1 is a hybrid defense framework that combines adversarial training with certified robustness to protect medical VQA systems from adversarial attacks while maintaining high-quality clinical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models show promise for medical VQA but are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, with standard adversarial training degrading both generalization and reasoning quality in clinical settings.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Training with Adversarial Training + Group Relative Policy Optimization to robustify reasoning process, 2) Inference augmentation with Randomized Smoothing for certified L2-norm robustness guarantees.

Result: On OmniMedVQA benchmark (8 modalities, 88k+ samples), standard VLMs drop from 95% to 25% accuracy under PGD attacks, while SafeMed-R1 maintains 84.45% accuracy - 59 percentage point robustness improvement. Models with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning show superior robustness.

Conclusion: SafeMed-R1 effectively protects medical VQA systems from adversarial attacks while preserving interpretable clinical reasoning, demonstrating synergy between interpretability and security in medical AI.

Abstract: Vision--Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA), yet their deployment in clinical settings is hindered by severe vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Standard adversarial training, while effective for simpler tasks, often degrades both generalization performance and the quality of generated clinical reasoning. We introduce SafeMed-R1, a hybrid defense framework that ensures robust performance while preserving high-quality, interpretable medical reasoning. SafeMed-R1 employs a two-stage approach: at training time, we integrate Adversarial Training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO) to explicitly robustify the reasoning process against worst-case perturbations; at inference time, we augment the model with Randomized Smoothing to provide certified $L_2$-norm robustness guarantees. We evaluate SafeMed-R1 on the OmniMedVQA benchmark across eight medical imaging modalities comprising over 88,000 samples. Our experiments reveal that standard fine-tuned VLMs, despite achieving 95\% accuracy on clean inputs, collapse to approximately 25\% under PGD attacks. In contrast, SafeMed-R1 maintains 84.45\% accuracy under the same adversarial conditions, representing a 59 percentage point improvement in robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models trained with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning exhibit superior adversarial robustness compared to instruction-only variants, suggesting a synergy between interpretability and security in medical AI systems.

*JiaWei Zhu,ZiHeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VIGOR+ is an iterative framework that combines LLMs and statistical validation (via CEVAE) to generate and refine hidden confounders for causal inference, using feedback to improve utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use LLMs to generate plausible hidden confounders, but they often lack statistical utility, creating a gap that limits effectiveness in observational causal inference.

Method: Proposes VIGOR+ with an iterative feedback mechanism: CEVAE provides validation signals (e.g., information gain) that are converted into natural language feedback to guide subsequent LLM generation rounds until convergence.

Result: The paper formalizes the feedback mechanism, proves convergence under mild assumptions, and provides a complete algorithmic framework for the VIGOR+ approach.

Conclusion: VIGOR+ closes the loop between LLM-based generation and statistical validation, enabling refined hidden confounders to address the fundamental challenge of hidden confounding in causal inference.

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a fundamental challenge in causal inference from observational data. Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate plausible hidden confounders based on domain knowledge, yet a critical gap exists: LLM-generated confounders often exhibit semantic plausibility without statistical utility. We propose VIGOR+ (Variational Information Gain for iterative cOnfounder Refinement), a novel framework that closes the loop between LLM-based confounder generation and CEVAE-based statistical validation. Unlike prior approaches that treat generation and validation as separate stages, VIGOR+ establishes an iterative feedback mechanism: validation signals from CEVAE (including information gain, latent consistency metrics, and diagnostic messages) are transformed into natural language feedback that guides subsequent LLM generation rounds. This iterative refinement continues until convergence criteria are met. We formalize the feedback mechanism, prove convergence properties under mild assumptions, and provide a complete algorithmic framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: We introduce PENDULUM, a benchmark of ~2,000 VQA pairs designed to evaluate sycophancy in MLLMs across six image domains, revealing models’ vulnerability and proposing new metrics for quantifying it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sycophancy, where AI models excessively agree with users at the expense of factual accuracy or visual evidence, is an underexplored challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), with limited research on visual or multimodal settings compared to text-only models.

Method: Create a comprehensive evaluation benchmark called PENDULUM consisting of approximately 2,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs targeting sycophantic responses, spanning six distinct image domains of varying complexity to systematically study how image type and challenges affect sycophancy.

Result: Extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs shows substantial variability in model robustness and a pronounced susceptibility to sycophantic and hallucinatory behavior across different multimodal contexts.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the urgent need to develop sycophancy-resilient architectures and training strategies to improve factual consistency and reliability in future MLLMs; the PENDULUM dataset and MLLMs responses are publicly available.

Abstract: Sycophancy, an excessive tendency of AI models to agree with user input at the expense of factual accuracy or in contradiction of visual evidence, poses a critical and underexplored challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While prior studies have examined this behavior in text-only settings of large language models, existing research on visual or multimodal counterparts remains limited in scope and depth of analysis. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, \textit{PENDULUM}, comprising approximately 2,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering pairs specifically designed to elicit sycophantic responses. The benchmark spans six distinct image domains of varying complexity, enabling a systematic investigation of how image type and inherent challenges influence sycophantic tendencies. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs. we observe substantial variability in model robustness and a pronounced susceptibility to sycophantic and hallucinatory behavior. Furthermore, we propose novel metrics to quantify sycophancy in visual reasoning, offering deeper insights into its manifestations across different multimodal contexts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing sycophancy-resilient architectures and training strategies to enhance factual consistency and reliability in future MLLMs. Our proposed dataset with MLLMs response are available at https://github.com/ashikiut/pendulum/.

### [55] [First-Order Representation Languages for Goal-Conditioned RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19355)
*Simon Ståhlberg,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using first-order languages in goal-conditioned RL, with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and goal representations as sets of atoms, improves learning general policies in large instances via goal curriculums.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First-order languages help specify MDPs and policies compactly, but learning goal-conditioned policies in large instances with sparse rewards is hard due to difficulty reaching goals through random exploration alone.

Method: Leverage Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to relabel trajectories. Represent goals as sets of atoms in three versions: full states, subsets of original goals, and lifted subgoals.

Result: The latter two versions (goals as subsets and lifted subgoals) successfully learn general policies on large planning instances by creating a curriculum of easier goals, enhancing data/time efficiency.

Conclusion: Goal representation as subsets or lifted subgoals enables automatic curriculum learning, improving performance in large-scale goal-conditioned RL with sparse rewards, though limitations exist for further development.

Abstract: First-order relational languages have been used in MDP planning and reinforcement learning (RL) for two main purposes: specifying MDPs in compact form, and representing and learning policies that are general and not tied to specific instances or state spaces. In this work, we instead consider the use of first-order languages in goal-conditioned RL and generalized planning. The question is how to learn goal-conditioned and general policies when the training instances are large and the goal cannot be reached by random exploration alone. The technique of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) provides an answer to this question: it relabels unsuccessful trajectories as successful ones by replacing the original goal with one that was actually achieved. If the target policy must generalize across states and goals, trajectories that do not reach the original goal states can enable more data- and time-efficient learning. In this work, we show that further performance gains can be achieved when states and goals are represented by sets of atoms. We consider three versions: goals as full states, goals as subsets of the original goals, and goals as lifted versions of these subgoals. The result is that the latter two successfully learn general policies on large planning instances with sparse rewards by automatically creating a curriculum of easier goals of increasing complexity. The experiments illustrate the computational gains of these versions, their limitations, and opportunities for addressing them.

*Simon Ståhlberg,Blai Bonet,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRL merges combinatorial planning and deep learning to learn generalizable policies using GNN-based state transition classifiers in actor-critic methods, addressing limitations with derived predicates and cost adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge reinforcement learning and combinatorial planning by exploring conditions under which deep reinforcement learning, particularly policy optimization, can achieve generalization like combinatorial methods, addressing the generalization challenge in RL.

Method: Use state transition classifiers with graph neural networks adapted to relational structures for policy representation in actor-critic methods, addressing expressive limitations and optimality-generalization tradeoffs via derived predicates and alternative cost structure.

Result: DRL learns generalizable policies comparable to combinatorial methods, without scalability bottlenecks or feature pools; limitations from GNN expressive constraints and optimality-generalization tradeoff are mitigated by enhancements.

Conclusion: Actor-critic DRL methods can learn nearly as generalizable policies as combinatorial planning approaches by modeling policies as state transition classifiers using graph neural networks, overcoming scalability and feature pool limitations.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods have delivered remarkable results in a number of settings, generalization, i.e., the ability to produce policies that generalize in a reliable and systematic way, has remained a challenge. The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize.

*Runze Li,Yuwen Zhai,Bo Xu,LiWu Xu,Nian Shi,Wei Zhang,Ran Lin,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EchoTrail-GUI is a framework that gives GUI agents a memory to learn from past task successes, automating experience collection and using retrieved memories to guide new tasks, improving performance and efficiency on Android benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents operate in isolation without learning from past experiences, leading to sub-optimal performance, repeated errors, and poor generalization to new challenges.

Method: The framework has three stages: 1. Experience Exploration: Autonomous interaction with GUI environments to build a database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model without human supervision. 2. Memory Injection: Efficient retrieval of relevant past trajectories as 'memories' for new tasks. 3. GUI Task Inference: Injection of memories as in-context guidance to inform the agent's reasoning and decision-making.

Result: EchoTrail-GUI significantly improves task success rate and operational efficiency on benchmarks like Android World and AndroidLab compared to baseline agents.

Conclusion: The approach validates the power of structured memory in creating more robust and intelligent GUI automation, addressing the limitation of digital 'amnesia' in agents.

Abstract: Contemporary GUI agents, while increasingly capable due to advances in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), often operate with a critical limitation: they treat each task in isolation, lacking a mechanism to systematically learn from past successes. This digital ''amnesia'' results in sub-optimal performance, repeated errors, and poor generalization to novel challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoTrail-GUI, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like experiential learning by equipping agents with a dynamic, accessible memory. Our framework operates in three distinct stages. First, during Experience Exploration, an agent autonomously interacts with GUI environments to build a curated database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model. Crucially, the entire knowledge base construction is thus fully automated, requiring no human supervision. Second, in the Memory Injection stage, upon receiving a new task, our system efficiently retrieves the most relevant past trajectories to serve as actionable ''memories''. Finally, during GUI Task Inference, these memories are injected as in-context guidance to inform the agent's reasoning and decision-making process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on benchmarks including Android World and AndroidLab. The results show that EchoTrail-GUI significantly improves the task success rate and operational efficiency of baseline agents, validating the power of structured memory in creating more robust and intelligent GUI automation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating scientific discovery, yet their static knowledge and hallucination issues hinder autonomous research applications. Recent advances integrate LLMs into agentic frameworks, enabling retrieval, reasoning, and tool use for complex scientific workflows. Here, we present a domain-specialized agent designed for reliable automation of first-principles materials computations. By embedding domain expertise, the agent ensures physically coherent multi-step workflows and consistently selects convergent, well-posed parameters, thereby enabling reliable end-to-end computational execution. A new benchmark of diverse computational tasks demonstrates that our system significantly outperforms standalone LLMs in both accuracy and robustness. This work establishes a verifiable foundation for autonomous computational experimentation and represents a key step toward fully automated scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuantiPhy benchmark quantitatively evaluates VLMs' physical reasoning ability on kinematic properties, revealing gaps between qualitative plausibility and numerical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations are VQA-based and qualitative; need quantitative assessment of VLMs' physical reasoning ability regarding kinematic quantities from video.

Method: Design first benchmark with 3.3K video-text instances with numerical ground truth to evaluate VLMs' ability to estimate object size, velocity, acceleration using standardized prompts and scoring.

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs show consistent gap between qualitative plausibility and numerical correctness; VLMs rely on pre-trained world knowledge rather than using provided visual-textual inputs.

Conclusion: QuantiPhy benchmark exposes gaps in VLMs' quantitative physical reasoning, highlighting reliance on pre-trained knowledge over faithful input use.

Abstract: Understanding the physical world is essential for generalist AI agents. However, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art vision perception models (e.g., large VLMs) can reason physical properties quantitatively. Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video observations. To address this, we present QuantiPhy, the first benchmark designed to quantitatively measure a VLM's physical reasoning ability. Comprising more than 3.3K video-text instances with numerical ground truth, QuantiPhy evaluates a VLM's performance on estimating an object's size, velocity, and acceleration at a given timestamp, using one of these properties as an input prior. The benchmark standardizes prompts and scoring to assess numerical accuracy, enabling fair comparisons across models. Our experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent gap between their qualitative plausibility and actual numerical correctness. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key factors like background noise, counterfactual priors, and strategic prompting and find that state-of-the-art VLMs lean heavily on pre-trained world knowledge rather than faithfully using the provided visual and textual inputs as references when reasoning kinematic properties quantitatively. QuantiPhy offers the first rigorous, scalable testbed to move VLMs beyond mere verbal plausibility toward a numerically grounded physical understanding.

TL;DR: A lifelong emotional motion generation task (L^2-EMG) is proposed using an ES-MoE method with emotion decoupling and scenario adaptation, validated on new datasets, showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single fixed-scale datasets, neglecting flexible and scale-increasing motion scenarios like sports or dance, which limits real-world generalization.

Method: Proposes an Emotion-Transferable and Scenario-Adapted Mixture of Experts (ES-MoE) approach with a causal-guided emotion decoupling block and scenario-adapted expert constructing block.

Result: Extensive evaluations on constructed L^2-EMG datasets show that ES-MoE outperforms advanced baselines.

Conclusion: The L^2-EMG task enhances LLMs' capability for lifelong emotional motion generation across unseen scenarios, contributing to empathetic and intelligent embodied agents with improved generalization.

Abstract: In the literature, existing human-centric emotional motion generation methods primarily focus on boosting performance within a single scale-fixed dataset, largely neglecting the flexible and scale-increasing motion scenarios (e.g., sports, dance), whereas effectively learning these newly emerging scenarios can significantly enhance the model's real-world generalization ability. Inspired by this, this paper proposes a new LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation (L^2-EMG) task, which aims to equip LLMs with the capability to continually acquire emotional motion generation knowledge across different unseen scenarios, potentially contributing to building a closed-loop and self-evolving embodied agent equipped with both empathy and intelligence. Further, this paper poses two key challenges in the L^2-EMG task, i.e., the emotion decoupling challenge and the scenario adapting challenge. To this end, this paper proposes an Emotion-Transferable and Scenario-Adapted Mixture of Experts (ES-MoE) approach which designs a causal-guided emotion decoupling block and a scenario-adapted expert constructing block to address the two challenges, respectively. Especially, this paper constructs multiple L^2-EMG datasets to validate the effectiveness of the ES-MoE approach. Extensive evaluations show that ES-MoE outperforms advanced baselines.

*Lawrence Krukrubo,Julius Odede,Olawande Olusegun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid XAI framework combining automated safety rules with minimal human-defined risk rules achieves 94% accuracy in churn prediction with 50% less human effort, transforming experts from rule writers to exception handlers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods are constrained by the 'Scalability-Stability Dilemma,' where post-hoc methods are scalable but unstable, and supervised methods are stable but require intensive human labeling effort.

Method: A Hybrid LRR-TED framework combining automated rule learning (GLRM) for broad 'Safety Nets' with human-driven identification of specific 'Risk Traps,' initializing explanation matrices with automated rules and augmenting with a small Pareto-optimal set of four human-defined risk rules.

Result: Achieves 94.00% predictive accuracy in customer churn prediction, outperforming a full 8-rule manual expert baseline while reducing human annotation effort by 50%, demonstrating the Anna Karenina Principle of Churn where automated methods excel at safety nets but struggle with risk traps.

Conclusion: The Hybrid LRR-TED framework successfully mitigates the 'Scalability-Stability Dilemma' by leveraging automated safety rules and minimal expert intervention for risk rules, positioning experts as 'Exception Handlers' which reduces human annotation effort by 50% while maintaining superior performance.

Abstract: Current approaches to Explainable AI (XAI) face a "Scalability-Stability Dilemma." Post-hoc methods (e.g., LIME, SHAP) may scale easily but suffer from instability, while supervised explanation frameworks (e.g., TED) offer stability but require prohibitive human effort to label every training instance. This paper proposes a Hybrid LRR-TED framework that addresses this dilemma through a novel "Asymmetry of Discovery." When applied to customer churn prediction, we demonstrate that automated rule learners (GLRM) excel at identifying broad "Safety Nets" (retention patterns) but struggle to capture specific "Risk Traps" (churn triggers)-a phenomenon we term the Anna Karenina Principle of Churn. By initialising the explanation matrix with automated safety rules and augmenting it with a Pareto-optimal set of just four human-defined risk rules, our approach achieves 94.00% predictive accuracy. This configuration outperforms the full 8-rule manual expert baseline while reducing human annotation effort by 50%, proposing a shift in the paradigm for Human-in-the-Loop AI: moving experts from the role of "Rule Writers" to "Exception Handlers."

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes viewing benchmarks for clinical risk score calculation as in-progress living documents, introduces a physician-audited pipeline to correct label noise in MedCalc-Bench, and shows that training on corrected labels improves model accuracy by 8.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Treating model-generated benchmarks like MedCalc-Bench as static oracles risks entrenching errors as evaluation gold standards, especially problematic in safety-critical domains like healthcare where benchmarks inform RL training.

Method: A systematic, physician-in-the-loop pipeline using advanced agentic verifiers to audit and relabel MedCalc-Bench, with automated triage to focus clinician attention on contentious instances, identifying errors from extraction, calculator logic mismatches, and clinical ambiguity.

Result: Audit revealed significant label noise; fine-tuning a Qwen3-8B model with GRPO on corrected labels yielded an 8.7% absolute improvement in accuracy over the baseline trained on original labels.

Conclusion: Rigorous benchmark maintenance is essential for model alignment in safety-critical domains, validating that label noise meaningfully impacts evaluation and training outcomes.

Abstract: Automating the calculation of clinical risk scores offers a significant opportunity to reduce physician administrative burden and enhance patient care. The current standard for evaluating this capability is MedCalc-Bench, a large-scale dataset constructed using LLM-based feature extraction and rule-based aggregation. However, treating such model-generated benchmarks as static oracles risks enshrining historical model errors as evaluation gold standards, a problem dangerously amplified when these datasets serve as reward signals for Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose viewing benchmarks for complex tasks such as clinical score computation as ''in-progress living documents'' that should be periodically re-evaluated as the processes for creating them improve. We introduce a systematic, physician-in-the-loop pipeline that leverages advanced agentic verifiers to audit and relabel MedCalc-Bench, utilizing automated triage to reserve scarce clinician attention for the most contentious instances. Our audit reveals that a notable fraction of original labels diverge from medical ground truth due to extraction errors, calculator logic mismatches, and clinical ambiguity. To study whether this label noise meaningfully impacts downstream RL training, we fine-tune a Qwen3-8B model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and demonstrate that training on corrected labels yields an 8.7% absolute improvement in accuracy over the original baseline -- validating that label noise materially affects model evaluation. These findings underscore that in safety-critical domains, rigorous benchmark maintenance is a prerequisite for genuine model alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study uses machine learning to predict lung cancer mortality rates in U.S. counties, finding that random forest models outperform others, with smoking rate as the top predictor and spatial clusters identified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of lung cancer mortality rates is crucial for guiding targeted interventions and addressing health disparities, as traditional regression-based models may lack predictive accuracy.

Method: Applied random forest, gradient boosting regression, and linear regression to predict county-level lung cancer mortality rates, evaluated with R-squared and RMSE, used SHAP for variable importance, and Getis-Ord hotspot analysis for geographic disparities.

Result: Random forest model performed best (R2: 41.9%, RMSE: 12.8). Smoking rate was the most important predictor, followed by median home value and Hispanic population percentage, with significant mortality clusters in mid-eastern counties.

Conclusion: The random forest model effectively predicts lung cancer mortality, highlighting key factors like smoking and demographic variables, providing actionable insights for targeted health interventions and reducing disparities.

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Accurate prediction of LC mortality rates is crucial for guiding targeted interventions and addressing health disparities. Although traditional regression-based models have been commonly used, explainable machine learning models may offer enhanced predictive accuracy and deeper insights into the factors influencing LC mortality. This study applied three models: random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and linear regression (LR) to predict county-level LC mortality rates across the United States. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values were used to determine variable importance and their directional impact. Geographic disparities in LC mortality were analyzed through Getis-Ord (Gi*) hotspot analysis. The RF model outperformed both GBR and LR, achieving an R2 value of 41.9% and an RMSE of 12.8. SHAP analysis identified smoking rate as the most important predictor, followed by median home value and the percentage of the Hispanic ethnic population. Spatial analysis revealed significant clusters of elevated LC mortality in the mid-eastern counties of the United States. The RF model demonstrated superior predictive performance for LC mortality rates, emphasizing the critical roles of smoking prevalence, housing values, and the percentage of Hispanic ethnic population. These findings offer valuable actionable insights for designing targeted interventions, promoting screening, and addressing health disparities in regions most affected by LC in the United States.

*Petr Koklev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a metric called the Price of Monotonicity (PoM) to quantify the performance cost of adding monotonicity constraints to gradient boosting models for predicting credit probability of default, showing it's minimal on large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial institutions struggle with balancing predictive accuracy and interpretability in machine learning models for credit risk. Monotonicity constraints improve interpretability by aligning with domain knowledge, but their performance impact is not well measured.

Method: Benchmarking monotone-constrained versus unconstrained gradient boosting models on five public datasets using three libraries. PoM is defined as the relative change in performance metrics when adding constraints, estimated via paired comparisons with bootstrap uncertainty.

Result: In experiments, PoM in AUC ranges from near zero to about 2.9%. Constraints are almost costless on large datasets (typically less than 0.2%) and most costly on smaller datasets with extensive constraint coverage (around 2-3%).

Conclusion: Appropriately specified monotonicity constraints can often provide interpretability with small accuracy losses, especially in large-scale credit portfolios, making them a viable option for balancing model requirements in finance.

Abstract: Financial institutions face a trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability when deploying machine learning models for credit risk. Monotonicity constraints align model behavior with domain knowledge, but their performance cost - the price of monotonicity - is not well quantified. This paper benchmarks monotone-constrained versus unconstrained gradient boosting models for credit probability of default across five public datasets and three libraries. We define the Price of Monotonicity (PoM) as the relative change in standard performance metrics when moving from unconstrained to constrained models, estimated via paired comparisons with bootstrap uncertainty. In our experiments, PoM in AUC ranges from essentially zero to about 2.9 percent: constraints are almost costless on large datasets (typically less than 0.2 percent, often indistinguishable from zero) and most costly on smaller datasets with extensive constraint coverage (around 2-3 percent). Thus, appropriately specified monotonicity constraints can often deliver interpretability with small accuracy losses, particularly in large-scale credit portfolios.

TL;DR: Convolutional neural operator extended to few-shot learning via pre-training and parameter adjustment strategies, with neuron linear transformation showing best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional neural operator hasn't been validated for few-shot learning scenarios despite showing good performance in other baseline comparisons.

Method: Extend convolutional neural operator to few-shot learning by pre-training on source dataset then adjusting parameters using small target dataset. Investigate three strategies: fine-tuning, low-rank adaptation, and neuron linear transformation.

Result: Neuron linear transformation strategy achieves highest surrogate accuracy for solving Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, Brusselator diffusion-reaction system, and Navier-Stokes equations.

Conclusion: The convolutional neural operator, when combined with neuron linear transformation strategy for parameter adjustment, shows strong performance in few-shot learning scenarios for solving various PDEs.

Abstract: Convolutional neural operator is a CNN-based architecture recently proposed to enforce structure-preserving continuous-discrete equivalence and enable the genuine, alias-free learning of solution operators of PDEs. This neural operator was demonstrated to outperform for certain cases some baseline models such as DeepONet, Fourier neural operator, and Galerkin transformer in terms of surrogate accuracy. The convolutional neural operator, however, seems not to be validated for few-shot learning. We extend the model to few-shot learning scenarios by first pre-training a convolutional neural operator using a source dataset and then adjusting the parameters of the trained neural operator using only a small target dataset. We investigate three strategies for adjusting the parameters of a trained neural operator, including fine-tuning, low-rank adaption, and neuron linear transformation, and find that the neuron linear transformation strategy enjoys the highest surrogate accuracy in solving PDEs such as Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, Brusselator diffusion-reaction system, and Navier-Stokes equations.

TL;DR: CodeGEMM, an efficient codebook-centric GEMM kernel for LLM inference, eliminates dequantization latency by precomputing inner products, achieving significant speedups in 2-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current codebook-based quantization methods for weight-only quantization in LLMs rely on dequantization, which incurs latency and cache pressure by repeatedly fetching centroids and reconstructing weights during inference.

Method: CodeGEMM replaces dequantization with a precomputed lightweight Psumbook storing inner products between centroids and activations; at inference, code indices directly gather partial sums, eliminating per-element lookups and reducing on-chip footprint.

Result: On Llama-3 models, CodeGEMM achieves 1.83x speedup for the 8B model and 8.93x speedup for the 70B model in 2-bit configuration compared to state-of-the-art codebook-based quantization, with comparable accuracy, improved computing efficiency, and better memory subsystem utilization.

Conclusion: CodeGEMM provides a unified approach to explore latency-memory-accuracy trade-offs, offering significant performance gains in LLM inference for extremely low-bit quantization, making it an effective solution for memory-bound systems.

Abstract: Weight-only quantization is widely used to mitigate the memory-bound nature of LLM inference. Codebook-based methods extend this trend by achieving strong accuracy in the extremely low-bit regime (e.g., 2-bit). However, current kernels rely on dequantization, which repeatedly fetches centroids and reconstructs weights, incurring substantial latency and cache pressure. We present CodeGEMM, a codebook-centric GEMM kernel that replaces dequantization with precomputed inner products between centroids and activations stored in a lightweight Psumbook. At inference, code indices directly gather these partial sums, eliminating per-element lookups and reducing the on-chip footprint. The kernel supports the systematic exploration of latency-memory-accuracy trade-offs under a unified implementation. On Llama-3 models, CodeGEMM delivers 1.83x (8B) and 8.93x (70B) speedups in the 2-bit configuration compared to state-of-the-art codebook-based quantization at comparable accuracy and further improves computing efficiency and memory subsystem utilization.

TL;DR: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA) enables high-performance HAR with significantly reduced computational costs compared to full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting large pretrained models to new domains remains challenging due to limited computational resources on target devices, motivating the need for parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques.

Method: The proposed adaptation framework uses a Masked Autoencoder backbone and evaluates LoRA and Quantized LoRA under a Leave-One-Dataset-Out validation protocol across five open HAR datasets.

Result: Both LoRA and QLoRA match the recognition performance of full fine-tuning while significantly reducing trainable parameters, memory usage, and training time. LoRA maintains robust performance under limited supervision, and QLoRA further reduces memory footprint with minimal impact on classification.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that LoRA and QLoRA are effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for Human Activity Recognition, providing scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning that maintain performance while significantly reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition is a foundational task in pervasive computing. While recent advances in self-supervised learning and transformer-based architectures have significantly improved HAR performance, adapting large pretrained models to new domains remains a practical challenge due to limited computational resources on target devices. This papers investigates parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, specifically Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized LoRA, as scalable alternatives to full model fine-tuning for HAR. We propose an adaptation framework built upon a Masked Autoencoder backbone and evaluate its performance under a Leave-One-Dataset-Out validation protocol across five open HAR datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that both LoRA and QLoRA can match the recognition performance of full fine-tuning while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, memory usage, and training time. Further analyses reveal that LoRA maintains robust performance even under limited supervision and that the adapter rank provides a controllable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. QLoRA extends these benefits by reducing the memory footprint of frozen weights through quantization, with minimal impact on classification quality.

*Mohammadmahdi Rahimiasl,Ynte Vanderhoydonc,Siegfried Mercelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HINT is a hybrid inductive-transductive network for traffic flow imputation at unsensed locations, using speed as a transductive signal, flow learning inductively, and integrating spatial transformers, diffusion GCNs, and calibration layers, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across multiple real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately imputing traffic flow at unsensed locations is challenging due to sparse loop detector data, weakly correlated probe vehicle speed, and strong heterophily in flow scales (e.g., ramps vs. mainline) that breaks standard GNN assumptions.

Method: Proposes HINT with an inductive-spatial transformer for long-range interactions, a diffusion GCN conditioned on static context (OSM attributes and traffic simulation), a node-wise calibration layer for scale biases, and INDU-TRANSDUCTIVE training using masked reconstruction, node sampling, hard-node mining, and noise injection on graph structures from driving distances.

Result: HINT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inductive baselines across MOW, UTD19-Torino, and UTD19-Essen datasets. It reduces MAE by approximately 42-50% on MOW, 22% on Torino, and 12% on Essen, with simulation improving performance, especially on Essen.

Conclusion: Combining inductive flow imputation with transductive speed, traffic simulations, and external geospatial data enhances accuracy for traffic flow imputation, demonstrating HINT's effectiveness in addressing heterophily and data sparsity challenges.

Abstract: Accurately imputing traffic flow at unsensed locations is difficult: loop detectors provide precise but sparse measurements, speed from probe vehicles is widely available yet only weakly correlated with flow, and nearby links often exhibit strong heterophily in the scale of traffic flow (e.g., ramps vs. mainline), which breaks standard GNN assumptions. We propose HINT, a Hybrid INductive-Transductive Network, and an INDU-TRANSDUCTIVE training strategy that treats speed as a transductive, network-wide signal while learning flow inductively to generalize to unseen locations. HINT couples (i) an inductive spatial transformer that learns similarity-driven, long-range interactions from node features with (ii) a diffusion GCN conditioned by FiLM on rich static context (OSM-derived attributes and traffic simulation), and (iii) a node-wise calibration layer that corrects scale biases per segment. Training uses masked reconstruction with epoch-wise node sampling, hard-node mining to emphasize difficult sensors, and noise injection on visible flows to prevent identity mapping, while graph structure is built from driving distances.
  Across three real-world datasets, MOW (Antwerp, Belgium), UTD19-Torino, and UTD19-Essen, HINT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inductive baselines. Relative to KITS, HINT reduces MAE on MOW by $\approx42$% with basic simulation and $\approx50$% with calibrated simulation; on Torino by $\approx22$%, and on Essen by $\approx12$%. Even without simulation, HINT remains superior on MOW and Torino, while simulation is crucial on Essen. These results show that combining inductive flow imputation with transductive speed, traffic simulations and external geospatial improves accuracy for the task described above.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to differentiate between user movements in familiar versus unfamiliar areas, which is crucial for accurate POI prediction as users exhibit different patterns in these contexts.

Method: Proposes MoE-TransMov, classifying movements into familiar/unfamiliar categories using user-check-in data, with expert networks and self-attention mechanisms to dynamically select relevant experts for different mobility contexts.

Result: MoE-TransMov outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Foursquare NYC and Kyoto datasets, showing notable improvements in Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 accuracy, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR).

Conclusion: The approach efficiently improves mobility predictions across different contexts, enhancing recommendation personalization and advancing urban applications.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the next point of interest (POI) within human mobility trajectories is essential for location-based services, as it enables more timely and personalized recommendations. In particular, with the rise of these approaches, studies have shown that users exhibit different POI choices in their familiar and unfamiliar areas, highlighting the importance of incorporating user familiarity into predictive models. However, existing methods often fail to distinguish between the movements of users in familiar and unfamiliar regions. To address this, we propose MoE-TransMov, a Transformer-based model with a Transformer model with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to use one framework to capture distinct mobility patterns across different moving contexts without requiring separate training for certain data. Using user-check-in data, we classify movements into familiar and unfamiliar categories and develop a specialized expert network to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach integrates self-attention mechanisms and adaptive gating networks to dynamically select the most relevant expert models for different mobility contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets, including the widely used but small open-source Foursquare NYC dataset and the large-scale Kyoto dataset collected with LY Corporation (Yahoo Japan Corporation), show that MoE-TransMov outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with notable improvements in Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 accuracy, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Given the results, we find that by using this approach, we can efficiently improve mobility predictions under different moving contexts, thereby enhancing the personalization of recommendation systems and advancing various urban applications.

Motivation: Federated Learning (FL) addresses data privacy concerns by keeping raw data on local devices, but struggles with heterogeneity, gradient noise, client-drift, and variance from partial client participation.

Method: FedOAED incorporates on-device autoencoder denoisers on client sides to mitigate client-drift and variance from partial client participation and heterogeneous data under limited client availability.

Result: Experiments on multiple vision datasets under Non-IID settings show FedOAED consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: FedOAED is a promising FL algorithm that effectively mitigates non-IID challenges and paves the way for more robust federated learning systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: Over the last few decades, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) solutions have demonstrated their potential across many applications by leveraging large amounts of high-quality data. However, strict data-sharing regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) have prevented many data-driven applications from being realised. Federated Learning (FL), in which raw data never leaves local devices, has shown promise in overcoming these limitations. Although FL has grown rapidly in recent years, it still struggles with heterogeneity, which produces gradient noise, client-drift, and increased variance from partial client participation. In this paper, we propose FedOAED, a novel federated learning algorithm designed to mitigate client-drift arising from multiple local training updates and the variance induced by partial client participation. FedOAED incorporates an on-device autoencoder denoiser on the client side to mitigate client-drift and variance resulting from heterogeneous data under limited client availability. Experiments on multiple vision datasets under Non-IID settings demonstrate that FedOAED consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Wei Qian,Chenxu Zhao,Yangyi Li,Mengdi Huai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First comprehensive benchmark for evaluating privacy vulnerabilities in selective forgetting/machine unlearning, systematically analyzing privacy leakage across diverse datasets, attacks, methods, and model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems are increasingly deployed in critical areas, ensuring privacy and alignment with human values is crucial. Selective forgetting enables data removal but introduces new privacy concerns, with existing attack evaluations being inconsistent and potentially biased due to different experimental settings.

Method: Extensive investigation of privacy vulnerabilities across wide range of victim data, state-of-the-art unlearning privacy attacks, unlearning methods, and model architectures. Systematic evaluation to identify critical factors in unlearning-induced privacy leakage.

Result: Development of a standardized benchmark that provides faithful privacy assessments for unlearning applications, identifying key vulnerability factors across different experimental configurations.

Conclusion: The benchmark serves as a crucial tool for practitioners to deploy customized unlearning applications with reliable privacy evaluations, addressing the gap in consistent assessment of privacy risks in machine unlearning.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have primarily focused on the process of learning from data to acquire knowledgeable learning systems. As these systems are increasingly deployed in critical areas, ensuring their privacy and alignment with human values is paramount. Recently, selective forgetting (also known as machine unlearning) has shown promise for privacy and data removal tasks, and has emerged as a transformative paradigm shift in the field of AI. It refers to the ability of a model to selectively erase the influence of previously seen data, which is especially important for compliance with modern data protection regulations and for aligning models with human values. Despite its promise, selective forgetting raises significant privacy concerns, especially when the data involved come from sensitive domains. While new unlearning-induced privacy attacks are continuously proposed, each is shown to outperform its predecessors using different experimental settings, which can lead to overly optimistic and potentially unfair assessments that may disproportionately favor one particular attack over the others. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating privacy vulnerabilities in selective forgetting. We extensively investigate privacy vulnerabilities of machine unlearning techniques and benchmark privacy leakage across a wide range of victim data, state-of-the-art unlearning privacy attacks, unlearning methods, and model architectures. We systematically evaluate and identify critical factors related to unlearning-induced privacy leakage. With our novel insights, we aim to provide a standardized tool for practitioners seeking to deploy customized unlearning applications with faithful privacy assessments.

### [73] [Probabilistic Digital Twins of Users: Latent Representation Learning with Statistically Validated Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18056)
*Daniel David*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic digital twin framework using a VAE for user modeling, offering interpretable, uncertainty-aware representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack uncertainty quantification and interpretability in user embeddings.

Method: VAE-based amortized variational inference on user-response data, with dimension-linked interpretation via hypothesis tests.

Result: User structure is continuous, with latent dimensions correlating to traits like opinion strength.

Conclusion: Probabilistic digital twins provide more interpretable and robust user representations than deterministic models.

Abstract: Understanding user identity and behavior is central to applications such as personalization, recommendation, and decision support. Most existing approaches rely on deterministic embeddings or black-box predictive models, offering limited uncertainty quantification and little insight into what latent representations encode. We propose a probabilistic digital twin framework in which each user is modeled as a latent stochastic state that generates observed behavioral data. The digital twin is learned via amortized variational inference, enabling scalable posterior estimation while retaining a fully probabilistic interpretation. We instantiate this framework using a variational autoencoder (VAE) applied to a user-response dataset designed to capture stable aspects of user identity. Beyond standard reconstruction-based evaluation, we introduce a statistically grounded interpretation pipeline that links latent dimensions to observable behavioral patterns. By analyzing users at the extremes of each latent dimension and validating differences using nonparametric hypothesis tests and effect sizes, we demonstrate that specific dimensions correspond to interpretable traits such as opinion strength and decisiveness. Empirically, we find that user structure is predominantly continuous rather than discretely clustered, with weak but meaningful structure emerging along a small number of dominant latent axes. These results suggest that probabilistic digital twins can provide interpretable, uncertainty-aware representations that go beyond deterministic user embeddings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Variational Deep Material Network (VDMN), a physics-informed surrogate model for efficient probabilistic prediction of material behavior, addressing aleatoric uncertainties in microstructures to advance uncertainty-robust digital twins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aleatoric uncertainties (e.g., variability in microstructure morphology, constituent behavior, and processing conditions) pose a major challenge to developing uncertainty-robust digital twins for materials.

Method: The VDMN embeds variational distributions within its hierarchical, mechanistic architecture and uses an analytic propagation scheme based on Taylor-series expansion and automatic differentiation to efficiently propagate uncertainty during training and prediction.

Result: VDMN demonstrates capabilities as an uncertainty-aware materials digital twin, predicting and experimentally validating nonlinear mechanical variability in additively manufactured polymer composites, and as an inverse calibration engine, identifying overlapping sources of uncertainty in constituent properties.

Conclusion: VDMN establishes a foundation for uncertainty-robust materials digital twins, enabling efficient probabilistic forward and inverse predictions in materials science applications.

Abstract: Aleatoric uncertainties - irremovable variability in microstructure morphology, constituent behavior, and processing conditions - pose a major challenge to developing uncertainty-robust digital twins. We introduce the Variational Deep Material Network (VDMN), a physics-informed surrogate model that enables efficient and probabilistic forward and inverse predictions of material behavior. The VDMN captures microstructure-induced variability by embedding variational distributions within its hierarchical, mechanistic architecture. Using an analytic propagation scheme based on Taylor-series expansion and automatic differentiation, the VDMN efficiently propagates uncertainty through the network during training and prediction. We demonstrate its capabilities in two digital-twin-driven applications: (1) as an uncertainty-aware materials digital twin, it predicts and experimentally validates the nonlinear mechanical variability in additively manufactured polymer composites; and (2) as an inverse calibration engine, it disentangles and quantitatively identifies overlapping sources of uncertainty in constituent properties. Together, these results establish the VDMN as a foundation for uncertainty-robust materials digital twins.

*Adam J. Thorpe,Stepan Tretiakov,Dibakar Roy Sarkar,Krishna Kumar,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: B2B⁻¹ is an inverse neural operator framework that decouples function representation from inversion using learned basis functions, enabling deterministic, invertible, and probabilistic models for ill-posed inverse PDE problems with strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems often violate continuity, uniqueness, and stability assumptions, challenging existing neural operator architectures that struggle with ill-posed inverse maps.

Method: Learn neural basis functions for input and output spaces, then train inverse models on the coefficient space to handle ill-posedness, with capabilities for deterministic, invertible, and probabilistic modeling.

Result: Evaluation on six inverse PDE benchmarks shows consistent performance, robustness to noise, and effective uncertainty capture, outperforming baselines across varying ill-posedness levels.

Conclusion: Decoupling representation from inversion allows scalable surrogate models that generalize across instances, domains, and degrees of ill-posedness, addressing limitations of current neural operators.

Abstract: Inverse problems challenge existing neural operator architectures because ill-posed inverse maps violate continuity, uniqueness, and stability assumptions. We introduce B2B${}^{-1}$, an inverse basis-to-basis neural operator framework that addresses this limitation. Our key innovation is to decouple function representation from the inverse map. We learn neural basis functions for the input and output spaces, then train inverse models that operate on the resulting coefficient space. This structure allows us to learn deterministic, invertible, and probabilistic models within a single framework, and to choose models based on the degree of ill-posedness. We evaluate our approach on six inverse PDE benchmarks, including two novel datasets, and compare against existing invertible neural operator baselines. We learn probabilistic models that capture uncertainty and input variability, and remain robust to measurement noise due to implicit denoising in the coefficient calculation. Our results show consistent re-simulation performance across varying levels of ill-posedness. By separating representation from inversion, our framework enables scalable surrogate models for inverse problems that generalize across instances, domains, and degrees of ill-posedness.

*Maxmillan Ries,Sohan Seth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TraCeR: Transformer-based survival analysis with longitudinal covariates and calibration evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in incorporating longitudinal covariates and assessing calibration in deep learning survival models.

Method: Transformer-based factorized self-attention architecture for estimating hazard function from longitudinal measurements.

Result: TraCeR achieves substantial statistically significant performance improvements over SOTA methods across multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TraCeR provides an effective transformer-based framework for survival analysis with longitudinal covariates, offering significant performance improvements and addressing calibration assessment.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a critical tool for modeling time-to-event data. Recent deep learning-based models have reduced various modeling assumptions including proportional hazard and linearity. However, a persistent challenge remains in incorporating longitudinal covariates, with prior work largely focusing on cross-sectional features, and in assessing calibration of these models, with research primarily focusing on discrimination during evaluation. We introduce TraCeR, a transformer-based survival analysis framework for incorporating longitudinal covariates. Based on a factorized self-attention architecture, TraCeR estimates the hazard function from a sequence of measurements, naturally capturing temporal covariate interactions without assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. The framework is inherently designed to handle censored data and competing events. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that TraCeR achieves substantial and statistically significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our evaluation extends beyond discrimination metrics and assesses model calibration, addressing a key oversight in literature.

### [77] [Grad: Guided Relation Diffusion Generation for Graph Augmentation in Graph Fraud Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18133)
*Jie Yang,Rui Zhang,Ziyang Cheng,Dawei Cheng,Guang Yang,Bo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grad is a graph augmentation model that uses supervised contrastive learning and relation diffusion to detect fraudsters who camouflage as benign users, improving detection performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle Adaptive Camouflage in Graph Fraud Detection (GFD), where fraudsters mimic benign user behavior to evade detection. This camouflage reduces the differences between fraudulent and benign users, causing current GFD models to lose effectiveness, especially in financial scenarios like online payment security.

Method: The paper proposes Grad, a relation diffusion-based graph augmentation model. It uses supervised graph contrastive learning to amplify differences between fraud and benign users, and employs a guided relation diffusion generator to create auxiliary homophilic relations. This approach strengthens weak fraudulent signals during graph aggregation, making them more detectable.

Result: Experimental results on two real-world datasets from WeChat Pay and three public datasets show that Grad outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 11.10% increase in AUC and 43.95% increase in AP.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed Grad model effectively addresses the Adaptive Camouflage problem in graph fraud detection by enhancing weak fraudulent signals through contrastive learning and relation diffusion, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on both real-world and public datasets.

Abstract: Nowadays, Graph Fraud Detection (GFD) in financial scenarios has become an urgent research topic to protect online payment security. However, as organized crime groups are becoming more professional in real-world scenarios, fraudsters are employing more sophisticated camouflage strategies. Specifically, fraudsters disguise themselves by mimicking the behavioral data collected by platforms, ensuring that their key characteristics are consistent with those of benign users to a high degree, which we call Adaptive Camouflage. Consequently, this narrows the differences in behavioral traits between them and benign users within the platform's database, thereby making current GFD models lose efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a relation diffusion-based graph augmentation model Grad. In detail, Grad leverages a supervised graph contrastive learning module to enhance the fraud-benign difference and employs a guided relation diffusion generator to generate auxiliary homophilic relations from scratch. Based on these, weak fraudulent signals would be enhanced during the aggregation process, thus being obvious enough to be captured. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets provided by WeChat Pay, one of the largest online payment platforms with billions of users, and three public datasets. The results show that our proposed model Grad outperforms SOTA methods in both various scenarios, achieving at most 11.10% and 43.95% increases in AUC and AP, respectively. Our code is released at https://github.com/AI4Risk/antifraud and https://github.com/Muyiiiii/WWW25-Grad.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about data privacy and consumer choice in LLM training, emphasizing user autonomy and data portability for communities with low utility from existing models.

Method: Interpret data privacy laws to argue CoT traces are personal data; apply Conscious Data Contribution framework to aggregate community knowledge; empirically test approach with varying community diversity, reasoning granularity, and size.

Result: Intermediate CoT computations are personal data; communities can create better-aligned models through knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: The empirical verification shows that communities can effectively distill their shared knowledge into better-aligned models, with performance influenced by community diversity, reasoning granularity, and size.

Abstract: The current era of AI development places a heavy emphasis on training large models on increasingly scaled-up datasets. This paradigm has catalyzed entirely new product categories, such as LLM chatbots, while also raising concerns about data privacy and consumer choice. In this paper, we consider questions of data portability and user autonomy in the context of LLMs that "reason" using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, computing intermediate text artifacts from user input before producing a final output. We first interpret recent data privacy and portability law to argue that these intermediate computations qualify as users' personal data. Then, building on the existing framework of Conscious Data Contribution, we show how communities who receive low utility from an available model can aggregate and distill their shared knowledge into an alternate model better aligned with their goals. We verify this approach empirically and investigate the effects of community diversity, reasoning granularity, and community size on distillation performance.

*Rebecca Salganik,Yibin Wang,Guillaume Salha-Galvan,Jian Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairExpand enables individual fairness in graph ML with only partial similarity info, using iterative representation refinement and fairness propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing individual fairness methods in graph representation learning require predefined similarity information for all node pairs, which is often unrealistic in practice and prevents operationalization.

Method: A two-step pipeline that alternates between refining node representations using a backbone model and gradually propagating similarity information to expand fairness enforcement across the entire graph.

Result: Extensive experiments show that FairExpand consistently enhances individual fairness while preserving performance, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Conclusion: FairExpand provides a practical and effective solution for enforcing individual fairness in graph representation learning when only partial similarity information is available, addressing a critical limitation of existing methods.

Abstract: Individual fairness, which requires that similar individuals should be treated similarly by algorithmic systems, has become a central principle in fair machine learning. Individual fairness has garnered traction in graph representation learning due to its practical importance in high-stakes Web areas such as user modeling, recommender systems, and search. However, existing methods assume the existence of predefined similarity information over all node pairs, an often unrealistic requirement that prevents their operationalization in practice. In this paper, we assume the similarity information is only available for a limited subset of node pairs and introduce FairExpand, a flexible framework that promotes individual fairness in this more realistic partial information scenario. FairExpand follows a two-step pipeline that alternates between refining node representations using a backbone model (e.g., a graph neural network) and gradually propagating similarity information, which allows fairness enforcement to effectively expand to the entire graph. Extensive experiments show that FairExpand consistently enhances individual fairness while preserving performance, making it a practical solution for enabling graph-based individual fairness in real-world applications with partial similarity information.

### [80] [When Does Learning Renormalize? Sufficient Conditions for Power Law Spectral Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18209)
*Yizhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies sufficient conditions for renormalizability in Generalized Resolution-Shell Dynamics (GRSD) and shows that power-law scaling emerges as a rigidity consequence when log-shift invariance combines with gradient flow's time-rescaling covariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empirical power-law scaling is widely observed in deep learning but its theoretical origins and validity scope remain incompletely understood. The paper aims to understand when and why such scaling occurs within the GRSD framework.

Method: The authors use the Generalized Resolution-Shell Dynamics framework, which models learning as spectral energy transport across logarithmic resolution shells, and identify sufficient conditions for renormalizability including bounded gradient propagation, weak functional incoherence, controlled Jacobian evolution, and log-shift invariance.

Result: The paper shows that power-law scaling doesn't follow from renormalizability alone but emerges as a rigidity consequence when log-shift invariance combines with the intrinsic time-rescaling covariance of gradient flow, forcing the renormalized GRSD velocity field into a power-law form.

Conclusion: Power-law scaling in deep learning systems arises from specific structural properties of the learning process rather than being automatic, and requires the combination of multiple constraints including renormalizability, log-shift invariance, and time-rescaling covariance.

Abstract: Empirical power--law scaling has been widely observed across modern deep learning systems, yet its theoretical origins and scope of validity remain incompletely understood. The Generalized Resolution--Shell Dynamics (GRSD) framework models learning as spectral energy transport across logarithmic resolution shells, providing a coarse--grained dynamical description of training. Within GRSD, power--law scaling corresponds to a particularly simple renormalized shell dynamics; however, such behavior is not automatic and requires additional structural properties of the learning process.
  In this work, we identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the GRSD shell dynamics admits a renormalizable coarse--grained description. These conditions constrain the learning configuration at multiple levels, including boundedness of gradient propagation in the computation graph, weak functional incoherence at initialization, controlled Jacobian evolution along training, and log--shift invariance of renormalized shell couplings. We further show that power--law scaling does not follow from renormalizability alone, but instead arises as a rigidity consequence: once log--shift invariance is combined with the intrinsic time--rescaling covariance of gradient flow, the renormalized GRSD velocity field is forced into a power--law form.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSSR is a group-free RLVR framework for MLLMs that uses entropy-based advantage-shaping to achieve stable and efficient multimodal reasoning with single-rollout training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group-based RLVR like GRPO requires multi-rollout sampling per prompt, which is inefficient, while single-rollout variants suffer from instability and training collapse in multimodal contexts, creating an efficiency-stability trade-off.

Method: Introduce MSSR, which employs an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes to prevent collapse and maintain stability in single-rollout multimodal RLVR.

Result: MSSR achieves superior training compute efficiency, matching validation accuracy of group-based baselines in half the training steps, and when trained equally, surpasses baseline performance with consistent generalization improvements across five reasoning-intensive benchmarks.

Conclusion: MSSR enables stable, compute-efficient, and effective RLVR for complex multimodal reasoning tasks, demonstrating that entropy-based regularization is essential for stability in multimodal single-rollout settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a key paradigm to improve the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, prevalent group-based algorithms such as GRPO require multi-rollout sampling for each prompt. While more efficient single-rollout variants have recently been explored in text-only settings, we find that they suffer from severe instability in multimodal contexts, often leading to training collapse. To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance. MSSR achieves this via an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes, preventing collapse and maintaining training stability. While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that MSSR enables stable, compute-efficient, and effective RLVR for complex multimodal reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: SDR efficiently selects compact subsets from large offline behavioral datasets by prioritizing early-stage data and using dual ranking, overcoming data saturation issues and reducing computational burden while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral cloning from large offline datasets leads to computationally intensive training, and there's striking data saturation where performance plateaus with small data fractions, indicating weak alignment between policy performance and test loss.

Method: Stepwise Dual Ranking (SDR) with two components: stepwise clip prioritizing early-stage data, and dual ranking selecting samples with high action-value and low state-density ranks.

Result: Extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks show that SDR significantly enhances data selection quality for offline behavioral data.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that data saturation is a key issue in offline behavioral datasets and that significant performance improvements can be achieved through smart data selection methods like SDR.

Abstract: Behavioral cloning is a widely adopted approach for offline policy learning from expert demonstrations. However, the large scale of offline behavioral datasets often results in computationally intensive training when used in downstream tasks. In this paper, we uncover the striking data saturation in offline behavioral data: policy performance rapidly saturates when trained on a small fraction of the dataset. We attribute this effect to the weak alignment between policy performance and test loss, revealing substantial room for improvement through data selection. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective method, Stepwise Dual Ranking (SDR), which extracts a compact yet informative subset from large-scale offline behavioral datasets. SDR is build on two key principles: (1) stepwise clip, which prioritizes early-stage data; and (2) dual ranking, which selects samples with both high action-value rank and low state-density rank. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that SDR significantly enhances data selection for offline behavioral data.

TL;DR: First non-asymptotic convergence analysis of original LoRA gradient descent shows O(1/log T) convergence rate without Lipschitz smoothness assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA is popular for fine-tuning large models due to its performance and computational efficiency, but its convergence is poorly understood because it lacks Lipschitz smoothness required for classic convergence analyses. Current theoretical results only consider asymptotic behavior or assume strong boundedness conditions.

Method: The analysis relies on three key steps: i) reformulating the problem in terms of the outer product of stacked adapter matrices, ii) a modified descent lemma for the Lipschitz-like reparametrized function, and iii) controlling the step size.

Result: The authors prove that LoRA gradient descent converges to a stationary point at rate O(1/log T), where T is the number of iterations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LoRA gradient descent converges to a stationary point at rate O(1/log T), providing the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis without artificial Lipschitz smoothness assumptions.

Abstract: The low-rank adaptation (LoRA) algorithm for fine-tuning large models has grown popular in recent years due to its remarkable performance and low computational requirements. LoRA trains two ``adapter" matrices that form a low-rank representation of the model parameters, thereby massively reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated at every step. Although LoRA is simple, its convergence is poorly understood due to the lack of Lipschitz smoothness, a key condition for classic convergence analyses. As a result, current theoretical results only consider asymptotic behavior or assume strong boundedness conditions which artificially enforce Lipschitz smoothness. In this work, we provide for the first time a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the \textit{original LoRA gradient descent} algorithm, which reflects widespread practice, without such assumptions. Our work relies on three key steps: i) reformulating the problem in terms of the outer product of the stacked adapter matrices, ii) a modified descent lemma for the ``Lipschitz-like" reparametrized function, and iii) controlling the step size. With this approach, we prove that LoRA gradient descent converges to a stationary point at rate $O(\frac{1}{\log T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical challenge of escalating operational costs in Databricks job execution, as existing static or reactive solutions fail to adapt to dynamic workload demands.

Method: The method involves leveraging machine learning for execution time prediction and using a solver-based optimization model for real-time resource allocation, moving beyond static configurations to proactive, dynamic adjustments.

Result: Experimental results show that LeJOT achieves an average 20% reduction in cloud computing costs within a minute-level scheduling timeframe, outperforming traditional static allocation strategies.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LeJOT offers a scalable and adaptive solution for cost-efficient job scheduling in Data Lakehouse environments, demonstrating its practical value in real-world Databricks deployments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in big data technologies, the Databricks platform has become a cornerstone for enterprises and research institutions, offering high computational efficiency and a robust ecosystem. However, managing the escalating operational costs associated with job execution remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions rely on static configurations or reactive adjustments, which fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of workloads. To address this, we introduce LeJOT, an intelligent job cost orchestration framework that leverages machine learning for execution time prediction and a solver-based optimization model for real-time resource allocation. Unlike conventional scheduling techniques, LeJOT proactively predicts workload demands, dynamically allocates computing resources, and minimizes costs while ensuring performance requirements are met. Experimental results on real-world Databricks workloads demonstrate that LeJOT achieves an average 20% reduction in cloud computing costs within a minute-level scheduling timeframe, outperforming traditional static allocation strategies.

Result: Unified convergence guarantees show the algorithms' effectiveness across diverse participation patterns.

Conclusion: The FedSUM framework broadens FL applicability by handling arbitrary client participation without additional assumptions on data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) methods are often designed for specific client participation patterns, limiting their applicability in practical deployments. We introduce the FedSUM family of algorithms, which supports arbitrary client participation without additional assumptions on data heterogeneity. Our framework models participation variability with two delay metrics, the maximum delay $τ_{\max}$ and the average delay $τ_{\text{avg}}$. The FedSUM family comprises three variants: FedSUM-B (basic version), FedSUM (standard version), and FedSUM-CR (communication-reduced version). We provide unified convergence guarantees demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach across diverse participation patterns, thereby broadening the applicability of FL in real-world scenarios.

*Xuling Zhang,Jindong Li,Yifei Zhang,Menglin Yang*

TL;DR: AL GNN: A novel continual graph learning framework using analytic learning theory with recursive least squares optimization, eliminating backpropagation and replay buffers for better privacy, efficiency, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CGL methods based on experience replay have privacy concerns, inefficiencies, and rely on historical data storage, creating a need for more efficient and privacy-preserving approaches.

Method: AL GNN uses analytic learning theory with recursive least squares optimization, closed-form classifier updates, and regularized feature autocorrelation matrices for efficient one-pass training.

Result: AL GNN achieves competitive/superior performance on benchmarks - 10% average improvement on CoraFull, >30% forgetting reduction on Reddit, and nearly 50% training time reduction.

Conclusion: AL GNN successfully addresses key CGL challenges through its analytic approach, offering enhanced privacy, efficiency, and competitive performance without backpropagation or replay buffers.

Abstract: Continual graph learning (CGL) aims to enable graph neural networks to incrementally learn from a stream of graph structured data without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Existing methods particularly those based on experience replay typically store and revisit past graph data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, these approaches pose significant limitations, including privacy concerns, inefficiency. In this work, we propose AL GNN, a novel framework for continual graph learning that eliminates the need for backpropagation and replay buffers. Instead, AL GNN leverages principles from analytic learning theory to formulate learning as a recursive least squares optimization process. It maintains and updates model knowledge analytically through closed form classifier updates and a regularized feature autocorrelation matrix. This design enables efficient one pass training for each task, and inherently preserves data privacy by avoiding historical sample storage. Extensive experiments on multiple dynamic graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that AL GNN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods. For instance, it improves average performance by 10% on CoraFull and reduces forgetting by over 30% on Reddit, while also reducing training time by nearly 50% due to its backpropagation free design.

### [87] [Embedded Safety-Aligned Intelligence via Differentiable Internal Alignment Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18309)
*Harsh Rathva,Ojas Srivastava,Pruthwik Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ESAI, a theoretical framework using internal alignment embeddings for multi-agent reinforcement learning to embed safety constraints directly into agent representations, with mechanisms like counterfactual penalties and attention modulation for harm reduction, focusing on theoretical analysis without empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for safety alignment in multi-agent reinforcement learning rely on external reward shaping or post-hoc constraints, which may not be fully integrated into agent learning. There's a need for a framework that embeds alignment directly into internal representations to enable more effective and inherent harm reduction in multi-agent systems.

Method: The ESAI framework integrates four key mechanisms: (1) differentiable counterfactual alignment penalties based on soft reference distributions, (2) alignment-weighted perceptual attention, (3) Hebbian associative memory for temporal credit assignment, and (4) similarity-weighted graph diffusion with bias mitigation controls. It analyzes stability conditions (e.g., under Lipchitz continuity and spectral constraints), computational complexity, and theoretical properties like contraction behavior.

Result: ESAI is positioned as a conceptual contribution, with analysis showing theoretical properties including stability conditions, contraction behavior, and fairness-performance tradeoffs. Computational complexity is assessed, but empirical evaluation is omitted, indicating the framework's theoretical viability pending future experimental work.

Conclusion: ESAI proposes a novel theoretical framework for embedding safety alignment in multi-agent reinforcement learning through internal embeddings, addressing gaps in external methods. It opens theoretical avenues regarding convergence, embedding dimensionality, and high-dimensional extensions, emphasizing the need for future empirical validation to test its practical effectiveness and scalability.

Abstract: We introduce Embedded Safety-Aligned Intelligence (ESAI), a theoretical framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning that embeds alignment constraints directly into agents internal representations using differentiable internal alignment embeddings. Unlike external reward shaping or post-hoc safety constraints, internal alignment embeddings are learned latent variables that predict externalized harm through counterfactual reasoning and modulate policy updates toward harm reduction through attention and graph-based propagation.
  The ESAI framework integrates four mechanisms: differentiable counterfactual alignment penalties computed from soft reference distributions, alignment-weighted perceptual attention, Hebbian associative memory supporting temporal credit assignment, and similarity-weighted graph diffusion with bias mitigation controls. We analyze stability conditions for bounded internal embeddings under Lipschitz continuity and spectral constraints, discuss computational complexity, and examine theoretical properties including contraction behavior and fairness-performance tradeoffs.
  This work positions ESAI as a conceptual contribution to differentiable alignment mechanisms in multi-agent systems. We identify open theoretical questions regarding convergence guarantees, embedding dimensionality, and extension to high-dimensional environments. Empirical evaluation is left to future work.

Conclusion: The combination of efficiency gains, predictive behavior, and transparent validation supports the trustworthy deployment of reinforcement learning in industrial energy systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a trustworthy reinforcement learning approach for the control of industrial compressed air systems. We develop a framework that enables safe and energy-efficient operation under realistic boundary conditions and introduce a multi-level explainability pipeline combining input perturbation tests, gradient-based sensitivity analysis, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) feature attribution. An empirical evaluation across multiple compressor configurations shows that the learned policy is physically plausible, anticipates future demand, and consistently respects system boundaries. Compared to the installed industrial controller, the proposed approach reduces unnecessary overpressure and achieves energy savings of approximately 4\,\% without relying on explicit physics models. The results further indicate that system pressure and forecast information dominate policy decisions, while compressor-level inputs play a secondary role. Overall, the combination of efficiency gains, predictive behavior, and transparent validation supports the trustworthy deployment of reinforcement learning in industrial energy systems.

TL;DR: Analysis of neural network optimization algorithms from SGD to higher-order methods, highlighting limitations and alternatives, with practical integration strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor understanding of optimization in modern AI and demystify training processes through principled algorithmic design.

Method: Tracing the evolution of algorithms from first-order (SGD, adaptive gradient methods) to modern higher-order techniques, including second-order approximations and layer-wise preconditioning.

Result: Reveals limitations of conventional approaches with real-world data anisotropy, motivating curvature-based alternatives and broader training toolkit integration.

Conclusion: Provides practical prescriptions to bridge theory and practice for deploying advanced optimization methods in deep learning workflows.

Abstract: Neural network optimization remains one of the most consequential yet poorly understood challenges in modern AI research, where improvements in training algorithms can lead to enhanced feature learning in foundation models, order-of-magnitude reductions in training time, and improved interpretability into how networks learn. While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants have become the de facto standard for training deep networks, their success in these over-parameterized regimes often appears more empirical than principled. This thesis investigates this apparent paradox by tracing the evolution of optimization algorithms from classical first-order methods to modern higher-order techniques, revealing how principled algorithmic design can demystify the training process. Starting from first principles with SGD and adaptive gradient methods, the analysis progressively uncovers the limitations of these conventional approaches when confronted with anisotropy that is representative of real-world data. These breakdowns motivate the exploration of sophisticated alternatives rooted in curvature information: second-order approximation techniques, layer-wise preconditioning, adaptive learning rates, and more. Next, the interplay between these optimization algorithms and the broader neural network training toolkit, which includes prior and recent developments such as maximal update parametrization, learning rate schedules, and exponential moving averages, emerges as equally essential to empirical success. To bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical deployment, this paper offers practical prescriptions and implementation strategies for integrating these methods into modern deep learning workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face the challenge of deciding when to replace existing trained models with new models that use newly available features, balancing learning-curve dynamics, data acquisition costs, and future benefits.

Method: Developed a unified economic and statistical framework linking learning-curve dynamics, data-acquisition costs, retraining costs, and discounting. Proposed three algorithms: one-shot baseline, greedy sequential method, and look-ahead sequential method.

Result: Using a real-world credit-scoring dataset, found that optimal switching times vary systematically with cost parameters and learning-curve behavior. The look-ahead sequential method outperforms other methods and approaches an oracle with full foresight. Established finite-sample guarantees with sublinear regret conditions.

Conclusion: Provides an operational blueprint for economically sound model transitions as new data sources become available.

Abstract: We study the problem of deciding whether, and when an organization should replace a trained incumbent model with a challenger relying on newly available features. We develop a unified economic and statistical framework that links learning-curve dynamics, data-acquisition and retraining costs, and discounting of future gains. First, we characterize the optimal switching time in stylized settings and derive closed-form expressions that quantify how horizon length, learning-curve curvature, and cost differentials shape the optimal decision. Second, we propose three practical algorithms: a one-shot baseline, a greedy sequential method, and a look-ahead sequential method. Using a real-world credit-scoring dataset with gradually arriving alternative data, we show that (i) optimal switching times vary systematically with cost parameters and learning-curve behavior, and (ii) the look-ahead sequential method outperforms other methods and is able to approach in value an oracle with full foresight. Finally, we establish finite-sample guarantees, including conditions under which the sequential look-ahead method achieve sublinear regret relative to that oracle. Our results provide an operational blueprint for economically sound model transitions as new data sources become available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework for analyzing optimism-based stochastic bandit algorithms, showing that logarithmic regret follows from a concentration condition and two simple deterministic lemmas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To isolate the minimal components behind proofs for algorithms like UCB and GP-UCB, which achieve logarithmic regret but have superficially different analyses, enabling streamlined and extensible proofs.

Method: Identify a high-probability concentration condition on estimators, then use two deterministic lemmas (radius collapse and optimism-forced deviations) to derive logarithmic regret, applying this to classical and contemporary bandit variants.

Result: The framework provides unified and near-minimal proofs for classical algorithms, extending naturally to modern bandit variants without complex case-specific analyses.

Conclusion: This approach simplifies regret analysis for optimism-based algorithms, offering a generalizable method that reduces redundancy and enhances understanding of the core principles behind logarithmic regret guarantees.

Abstract: Several optimism-based stochastic bandit algorithms -- including UCB, UCB-V, linear UCB, and finite-arm GP-UCB -- achieve logarithmic regret using proofs that, despite superficial differences, follow essentially the same structure. This note isolates the minimal ingredients behind these analyses: a single high-probability concentration condition on the estimators, after which logarithmic regret follows from two short deterministic lemmas describing radius collapse and optimism-forced deviations. The framework yields unified, near-minimal proofs for these classical algorithms and extends naturally to many contemporary bandit variants.

### [92] [MoE Pathfinder: Trajectory-driven Expert Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18425)
*Xican Yang,Yuanhe Tian,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a trajectory-based expert pruning approach for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, using global optimization to improve performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures in LLMs face deployment complexity and low activation efficiency, while existing expert pruning methods use local metrics and uniform layer-wise pruning, neglecting heterogeneous expert contributions across layers.

Method: Treats MoE as a weighted computation graph and formulates expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem, integrating reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength signals at the trajectory level to enable non-uniform expert retention across layers.

Result: Achieves superior pruning performance on nearly all tasks compared with most existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed trajectory-based pruning approach effectively addresses limitations of local methods, enhancing MoE model efficiency and simplification.

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures used in large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks yet face practical challenges such as deployment complexity and low activation efficiency. Expert pruning has thus emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational overhead and simplify the deployment of MoE models. However, existing expert pruning approaches conventionally rely on local importance metrics and often apply uniform layer-wise pruning, leveraging only partial evaluation signals and overlooking the heterogeneous contributions of experts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose an expert pruning approach based on the trajectory of activated experts across layers, which treats MoE as a weighted computation graph and casts expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem. Within this framework, we integrate complementary importance signals from reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength at the trajectory level, which naturally yields non-uniform expert retention across layers. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior pruning performance on nearly all tasks compared with most existing approaches.

TL;DR: This paper investigates MLP layers in transformers by hypothesizing they secretly perform sparse computations, showing connections to MoE layers and validating with empirical evidence on LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The MLP layers in transformer architectures are dense and poorly understood, limiting insights into transformer efficiency and MoE models.

Method: Propose theoretical link between MoE and Sparse Autoencoder structures, test hypothesis on pretrained LLM activations, compare to Gaussian data.

Result: MLP layers in LLMs can be approximated by sparse MoE layers, revealing activation structure importance; insights for MoE-based transformers and low-rank routers.

Conclusion: MLP layers act subconsciously as sparse experts, explaining MoE effectiveness and guiding future architecture designs.

Abstract: Despite being one of the earliest neural network layers, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is arguably one of the least understood parts of the transformer architecture due to its dense computation and lack of easy visualization. This paper seeks to understand the MLP layers in dense LLM models by hypothesizing that these layers secretly approximately perform a sparse computation -- namely, that they can be well approximated by sparsely-activating Mixture of Experts (MoE) layers.
  Our hypothesis is based on a novel theoretical connection between MoE models and Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) structure in activation space. We empirically validate the hypothesis on pretrained LLMs, and demonstrate that the activation distribution matters -- these results do not hold for Gaussian data, but rather rely crucially on structure in the distribution of neural network activations.
  Our results shine light on a general principle at play in MLP layers inside LLMs, and give an explanation for the effectiveness of modern MoE-based transformers. Additionally, our experimental explorations suggest new directions for more efficient MoE architecture design based on low-rank routers.

*Jayant Lohia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOVA discovers numerically stable transform points for Winograd convolution, enabling efficient large-tile computation in low-precision hardware without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Winograd convolution faces critical numerical instability in low-precision computing (FP16/Int8), with condition numbers exploding as tiles scale (e.g., kappa = 2 × 10^5 for F(8,3)), rendering large tiles unusable.

Method: NOVA treats Winograd point selection as a continuous optimization problem, uses Evolution Strategy to search the manifold R^n-1, snaps candidates to simple rationals, and guarantees correctness via symbolic verification.

Result: NOVA improves conditioning of F(8,3) by 415× in 1D (172,484× for 2D), restores full FP16 ImageNet accuracy (75-78%) where standard transforms collapse to random (4.7%), and discovers stable fractional configurations like {±5/6, ±7/6, ±3/5}.

Conclusion: NOVA represents a significant breakthrough in numerical stability for Winograd convolution, enabling efficient large-tile implementations in low-precision computing environments like FP16 and Int8 without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Winograd convolution is the standard algorithm for efficient inference, reducing arithmetic complexity by 2.25x for 3x3 kernels. However, it faces a critical barrier in the modern era of low precision computing: numerical instability. As tiles scale to maximize efficiency (e.g., F(6,3), F(8,3)), the condition numbers of standard integer based transforms explode, reaching kappa = 2 x 10^5 for F(8,3), rendering them unusable in FP16 or Int8. We introduce NOVA (Numerical Optimization of Vandermonde Arithmetic), a discovery framework that breaks the decades old convention of integer interpolation. Treating Winograd point selection as a continuous optimization problem, NOVA searches the manifold R^n-1 via Evolution Strategy, snaps candidates to simple rationals, and guarantees correctness via symbolic verification. This process uncovers a hidden landscape of stable, fractional configurations such as {+-5/6, +-7/6, +-3/5} that defy traditional vocabulary constraints. The impact is transformative: NOVA improves the conditioning of F(8,3) by 415x in 1D, which squares to a 172,484x improvement for 2D convolution. In real world FP16 ImageNet inference, where standard transforms collapse to random chance (e.g., 4.7 percent accuracy on VGG16), NOVA's points restore full accuracy (75 to 78 percent), recovering over 70 percentage points without retraining, calibration, or learned parameters. These discovered transforms act as drop in replacements, effectively unlocking the efficiency of large tile Winograd convolution for next generation hardware.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic OOD detection framework for irregular 3D graphs using diffusion models with unified continuous diffusion over coordinates and discrete features, validated on protein-ligand complexes and enhanced by multi-scale trajectory statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive models degrade on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, posing reliability challenges for complex 3D graph data like protein-ligand complexes, which combine continuous geometry with categorical identities and are unordered.

Method: Develop a diffusion model that learns training distribution density unsupervised, embedding categorical features in continuous space with cross-entropy and deriving diffusion scores analytically via posterior-mean interpolation. This yields a self-consistent probability-flow ODE for generating per-sample log-likelihoods.

Result: PF-ODE likelihoods effectively identify withheld protein families as OOD and correlate with binding-affinity prediction errors. Multi-scale trajectory statistics (e.g., path tortuosity) provide complementary OOD detection, improving sensitivity over likelihood-only baselines when modeled jointly.

Conclusion: The framework offers a principled, label-free OOD quantification workflow for geometric deep learning, enabling reliable deployment of models on complex 3D graph data through enhanced detection capabilities.

Abstract: Predictive machine learning models generally excel on in-distribution data, but their performance degrades on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Reliable deployment therefore requires robust OOD detection, yet this is particularly challenging for irregular 3D graphs that combine continuous geometry with categorical identities and are unordered by construction. Here, we present a probabilistic OOD detection framework for complex 3D graph data built on a diffusion model that learns a density of the training distribution in a fully unsupervised manner. A key ingredient we introduce is a unified continuous diffusion over both 3D coordinates and discrete features: categorical identities are embedded in a continuous space and trained with cross-entropy, while the corresponding diffusion score is obtained analytically via posterior-mean interpolation from predicted class probabilities. This yields a single self-consistent probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) that produces per-sample log-likelihoods, providing a principled typicality score for distribution shift. We validate the approach on protein-ligand complexes and construct strict OOD datasets by withholding entire protein families from training. PF-ODE likelihoods identify held-out families as OOD and correlate strongly with prediction errors of an independent binding-affinity model (GEMS), enabling a priori reliability estimates on new complexes. Beyond scalar likelihoods, we show that multi-scale PF-ODE trajectory statistics - including path tortuosity, flow stiffness, and vector-field instability - provide complementary OOD information. Modeling the joint distribution of these trajectory features yields a practical, high-sensitivity detector that improves separation over likelihood-only baselines, offering a label-free OOD quantification workflow for geometric deep learning.

Result: SOM is effective in analyzing complex datasets, enabling high-dimensional data visualization, detecting hidden ecological patterns, and identifying critical correlations among water quality indicators.

Conclusion: The review concludes that SOM is a powerful tool for water quality assessment, offering comprehensive insights into existing methodologies and supporting future research and practical applications.

Abstract: Sustainable water quality underpins ecological balance and water security. Assessing and managing lakes and reservoirs is difficult due to data sparsity, heterogeneity, and nonlinear relationships among parameters. This review examines how Self-Organizing Map (SOM), an unsupervised AI technique, is applied to water quality assessment. It synthesizes research on parameter selection, spatial and temporal sampling strategies, and clustering approaches. Emphasis is placed on how SOM handles multidimensional data and uncovers hidden patterns to support effective water management. The growing availability of environmental data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, IoT technologies, and historical records has significantly expanded analytical opportunities in environmental monitoring. SOM has proven effective in analysing complex datasets, particularly when labelled data are limited or unavailable. It enables high-dimensional data visualization, facilitates the detection of hidden ecological patterns, and identifies critical correlations among diverse water quality indicators. This review highlights SOMs versatility in ecological assessments, trophic state classification, algal bloom monitoring, and catchment area impact evaluations. The findings offer comprehensive insights into existing methodologies, supporting future research and practical applications aimed at improving the monitoring and sustainable management of lake and reservoir ecosystems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Recursive Metric Contraction, a geometric framework to address the flat manifold problem in continual learning by collapsing local metrics to prevent representational overload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning systems face the flat manifold problem, where linear trajectories in Euclidean space cause volume expansion and catastrophic interference in fixed-dimensional hardware.

Method: Use a quotient map that contracts the metric tensor within validated temporal neighborhoods, effectively reducing local manifold diameters to zero, formalized as Recursive Metric Contraction.

Result: Four theorems: Bounded Capacity Theorem allows embedding long trajectories into bounded volumes; Topological Collapse Separability Theorem ensures linear separability of sequences; Parity-Partitioned Stability Theorem prevents catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: Tokens in neural architectures can be realized as singularities or wormholes, bridging distant temporal points, providing a geometric resolution to continual learning challenges.

Abstract: Continual learning systems operating in fixed-dimensional spaces face a fundamental geometric barrier: the flat manifold problem. When experience is represented as a linear trajectory in Euclidean space, the geodesic distance between temporal events grows linearly with time, forcing the required covering number to diverge. In fixed-dimensional hardware, this volume expansion inevitably forces trajectory overlap, manifesting as catastrophic interference. In this work, we propose a geometric resolution to this paradox based on Recursive Metric Contraction. We formalize abstraction not as symbolic grouping, but as a topological deformation: a quotient map that collapses the metric tensor within validated temporal neighborhoods, effectively driving the diameter of local sub-manifolds to zero. We substantiate our framework with four rigorous results. First, the Bounded Capacity Theorem establishes that recursive quotient maps allow the embedding of arbitrarily long trajectories into bounded representational volumes, trading linear metric growth for logarithmic topological depth. Second, the Topological Collapse Separability Theorem, derived via Urysohn's Lemma, proves that recursive quotienting renders non-linearly separable temporal sequences linearly separable in the limit, bypassing the need for infinite-dimensional kernel projections. Third, the Parity-Partitioned Stability Theorem solves the catastrophic forgetting problem by proving that if the state space is partitioned into orthogonal flow and scaffold manifolds, the metric deformations of active learning do not disturb the stability of stored memories. Our analysis reveals that tokens in neural architectures are physically realizable as singularities or wormholes, regions of extreme positive curvature that bridge distant points in the temporal manifold.

TL;DR: Machine learning models using drought indices effectively forecast drought impacts up to 8 weeks ahead, with highest accuracy for Fire and Relief impacts, supporting early warning systems in drought-prone regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent increases in drought severity, frequency, and duration underscore the need for effective monitoring and mitigation strategies. Predicting drought impacts rather than just conditions supports early warning systems and proactive decision-making.

Method: Uses machine learning techniques, specifically eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to link drought indices (DSCI and ESI) with historical drought impact records from the Drought Impact Reporter (DIR) to generate short-term impact forecasts.

Result: Fire and Relief impacts were predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by Agriculture and Water, while forecasts for Plants and Society impacts showed greater variability. County and state level forecasts for New Mexico were produced up to eight weeks in advance using the preceding eight weeks of data for most impact categories.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning for drought impact forecasting, supporting the development of systems like EcoDri and showing potential for broader use in drought-prone regions to aid stakeholders in mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Drought is a complex natural hazard that affects ecological and human systems, often resulting in substantial environmental and economic losses. Recent increases in drought severity, frequency, and duration underscore the need for effective monitoring and mitigation strategies. Predicting drought impacts rather than drought conditions alone offers opportunities to support early warning systems and proactive decision-making. This study applies machine learning techniques to link drought indices with historical drought impact records (2005:2024) to generate short-term impact forecasts. By addressing key conceptual and data-driven challenges regarding temporal scale and impact quantification, the study aims to improve the predictability of drought impacts at actionable lead times. The Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) were combined with impact data from the Drought Impact Reporter (DIR) to model and forecast weekly drought impacts. Results indicate that Fire and Relief impacts were predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by Agriculture and Water, while forecasts for Plants and Society impacts showed greater variability. County and state level forecasts for New Mexico were produced using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that incorporated both DSCI and ESI. The model successfully generated forecasts up to eight weeks in advance using the preceding eight weeks of data for most impact categories. This work supports the development of an Ecological Drought Information Communication System (EcoDri) for New Mexico and demonstrates the potential for broader application in similar drought-prone regions. The findings can aid stakeholders, land managers, and decision-makers in developing and implementing more effective drought mitigation and adaptation strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid method combining GNNs with engineered graph-theoretic features to classify synthetic graph families, achieving high accuracy with models like GraphSAGE and GTN, outperforming a baseline SVM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve graph classification by integrating GNNs with interpretable graph-theoretic features, as few studies explore this combination for discriminating between generative graph models.

Method: Generated a large synthetic dataset of five graph families, extracted and pruned graph features, integrated them into six GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GATv2, GIN, GraphSAGE, GTN), optimized hyperparameters with Optuna, and compared to an SVM baseline trained on handcrafted features.

Result: GraphSAGE and GTN achieved the highest classification accuracy of 98.5%, with strong class separation in visualizations, while GAT-based models underperformed; SVM baseline highlighted the importance of GNN message passing.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively combines GNNs with graph-theoretic features for superior graph classification, with GraphSAGE and GTN as top performers, emphasizing the value of message passing over traditional methods.

Abstract: The ability to discriminate between generative graph models is critical to understanding complex structural patterns in both synthetic graphs and the real-world structures that they emulate. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have seen increasing use to great effect in graph classification tasks, few studies explore their integration with interpretable graph theoretic features. This paper investigates the classification of synthetic graph families using a hybrid approach that combines GNNs with engineered graph-theoretic features. We generate a large and structurally diverse synthetic dataset comprising graphs from five representative generative families, Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, Barab'asi-Albert, Holme-Kim, and Stochastic Block Model. These graphs range in size up to 1x10^4 nodes, containing up to 1.1x10^5 edges. A comprehensive range of node and graph level features is extracted for each graph and pruned using a Random Forest based feature selection pipeline. The features are integrated into six GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, GATv2, GIN, GraphSAGE and GTN. Each architecture is optimised for hyperparameter selection using Optuna. Finally, models were compared against a baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained solely on the handcrafted features. Our evaluation demonstrates that GraphSAGE and GTN achieve the highest classification performance, with 98.5% accuracy, and strong class separation evidenced by t-SNE and UMAP visualisations. GCN and GIN also performed well, while GAT-based models lagged due to limitations in their ability to capture global structures. The SVM baseline confirmed the importance of the message passing functionality for performance gains and meaningful class separation.

*Ruiqi Chen,Giacomo Vedovati,Todd Braver,ShiNung Ching*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFORM is a method for aligning dynamical system trajectories across coordinate systems and identifying low-dimensional motifs in high-dimensional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable comparison of learned dynamics across models and identify mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs in high-dimensional nonlinear models like RNNs.

Method: DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems to align their trajectories in a one-to-one manner.

Result: DFORM successfully identified linear and nonlinear transformations in canonical systems, quantified similarity between topologically distinct systems, and located dynamical motifs in high-dimensional RNN models trained on fMRI data.

Conclusion: DFORM provides a robust framework for comparing dynamical systems across coordinate systems and identifying key dynamical motifs in high-dimensional models.

Abstract: Dynamical systems models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are increasingly popular in theoretical neuroscience for hypothesis-generation and data analysis. Evaluating the dynamics in such models is key to understanding their learned generative mechanisms. However, such evaluation is impeded by two major challenges: First, comparison of learned dynamics across models is difficult because there is no enforced equivalence of their coordinate systems. Second, identification of mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs (e.g., limit sets) is intractable in high-dimensional nonlinear models such as RNNs. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to address these two issues, termed Diffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models (DFORM). DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems, which aligns their trajectories in a maximally one-to-one manner. In so doing, DFORM enables an assessment of whether two models exhibit topological equivalence, i.e., similar mechanisms despite differences in coordinate systems. A byproduct of this method is a means to locate dynamical motifs on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within higher-dimensional systems. We verified DFORM's ability to identify linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations using canonical topologically equivalent systems, RNNs, and systems related by nonlinear flows. DFORM was also shown to provide a quantification of similarity between topologically distinct systems. We then demonstrated that DFORM can locate important dynamical motifs including invariant manifolds and saddle limit sets within high-dimensional models. Finally, using a set of RNN models trained on human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings, we illustrated that DFORM can identify limit cycles from high-dimensional data-driven models, which agreed well with prior numerical analysis.

TL;DR: A study evaluating memory mechanisms in SNNs across visual and auditory modalities, showing modality-dependent performance and optimized parallel architecture for cross-modal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory-augmented SNNs offer energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, but their generalization across different sensory modalities hasn't been explored, motivating this cross-modal study.

Method: Conducted a cross-modal ablation study on SNNs using Hopfield networks, HGRNs, and SCL across N-MNIST (visual) and SHD (auditory) datasets, with systematic evaluation of five architectures and quantitative engram analysis.

Result: Hopfield networks achieved 97.68% visual vs 76.15% auditory accuracy (21.53 gap), SCL showed 96.72% visual vs 82.16% auditory (14.56 gap), joint multi-modal HGRN training reached 94.41% visual and 79.37% auditory accuracy (88.78% average) with 603x energy efficiency over traditional networks.

Conclusion: Memory mechanisms in SNNs exhibit task-specific specialization rather than universal applicability, supporting parallel architecture design for multi-modal applications in neuromorphic systems.

Abstract: Memory-augmented spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, yet their generalization across sensory modalities remains unexplored. We present the first comprehensive cross-modal ablation study of memory mechanisms in SNNs, evaluating Hopfield networks, Hierarchical Gated Recurrent Networks (HGRNs), and supervised contrastive learning (SCL) across visual (N-MNIST) and auditory (SHD) neuromorphic datasets. Our systematic evaluation of five architectures reveals striking modality-dependent performance patterns: Hopfield networks achieve 97.68% accuracy on visual tasks but only 76.15% on auditory tasks (21.53 point gap), revealing severe modality-specific specialization, while SCL demonstrates more balanced cross-modal performance (96.72% visual, 82.16% audio, 14.56 point gap). These findings establish that memory mechanisms exhibit task-specific benefits rather than universal applicability. Joint multi-modal training with HGRN achieves 94.41% visual and 79.37% audio accuracy (88.78% average), matching parallel HGRN performance through unified deployment. Quantitative engram analysis confirms weak cross-modal alignment (0.038 similarity), validating our parallel architecture design. Our work provides the first empirical evidence for modality-specific memory optimization in neuromorphic systems, achieving 603x energy efficiency over traditional neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting abundant expert demonstrations for Adversarial Imitation Learning is challenging in many scenarios, which limits performance and stability improvements.

Method: Utilizes a diffusion model in the discriminator to generate synthetic demonstrations as pseudo-expert data, augmenting expert demonstrations, and introduces a prioritized expert demonstration replay strategy (PEDR) to selectively replay valuable demonstrations from the large pool.

Result: Experimental results on simulation tasks show effectiveness and robustness; in the Hopper task, SD2AIL achieves an average return of 3441, surpassing the state-of-the-art method by 89.

Conclusion: SD2AIL successfully leverages diffusion models to overcome demonstration scarcity in AIL, with the PEDR strategy enhancing performance, making it a robust solution for simulation tasks.

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) is a dominant framework in imitation learning that infers rewards from expert demonstrations to guide policy optimization. Although providing more expert demonstrations typically leads to improved performance and greater stability, collecting such demonstrations can be challenging in certain scenarios. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in data generation, we propose SD2AIL, which utilizes synthetic demonstrations via diffusion models. We first employ a diffusion model in the discriminator to generate synthetic demonstrations as pseudo-expert data that augment the expert demonstrations. To selectively replay the most valuable demonstrations from the large pool of (pseudo-) expert demonstrations, we further introduce a prioritized expert demonstration replay strategy (PEDR). The experimental results on simulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. In particular, in the Hopper task, our method achieves an average return of 3441, surpassing the state-of-the-art method by 89. Our code will be available at https://github.com/positron-lpc/SD2AIL.

TL;DR: REALM is a benchmarking framework that exposes the limitations of current neural surrogates for multiphysics dynamics through rigorous testing on realistic datasets, revealing scaling barriers and gaps between accuracy metrics and physical trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural surrogate evaluations rely on simplified proxies that don't test models' fragility in realistic multiphysics regimes, creating an "illusion of mastery" in the field.

Method: Developed REALM with 11 high-fidelity datasets spanning canonical problems to complex applications, with standardized training/evaluation protocol including multiphysics-aware preprocessing and robust rollout strategy. Benchmarked over a dozen model families including spectral operators, convolutional models, Transformers, and graph networks.

Result: Identified three key trends: (i) scaling barrier governed by dimensionality, stiffness, and mesh irregularity causing rollout errors; (ii) performance controlled by architectural inductive biases rather than parameter count; (iii) persistent gap between accuracy metrics and physically trustworthy behavior even for high-correlation models.

Conclusion: REALM exposes current neural surrogates' limitations for realistic multiphysics flows and provides a rigorous testbed for developing next-generation physics-aware architectures.

Abstract: Predicting multiphysics dynamics is computationally expensive and challenging due to the severe coupling of multi-scale, heterogeneous physical processes. While neural surrogates promise a paradigm shift, the field currently suffers from an "illusion of mastery", as repeatedly emphasized in top-tier commentaries: existing evaluations overly rely on simplified, low-dimensional proxies, which fail to expose the models' inherent fragility in realistic regimes. To bridge this critical gap, we present REALM (REalistic AI Learning for Multiphysics), a rigorous benchmarking framework designed to test neural surrogates on challenging, application-driven reactive flows. REALM features 11 high-fidelity datasets spanning from canonical multiphysics problems to complex propulsion and fire safety scenarios, alongside a standardized end-to-end training and evaluation protocol that incorporates multiphysics-aware preprocessing and a robust rollout strategy. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark over a dozen representative surrogate model families, including spectral operators, convolutional models, Transformers, pointwise operators, and graph/mesh networks, and identify three robust trends: (i) a scaling barrier governed jointly by dimensionality, stiffness, and mesh irregularity, leading to rapidly growing rollout errors; (ii) performance primarily controlled by architectural inductive biases rather than parameter count; and (iii) a persistent gap between nominal accuracy metrics and physically trustworthy behavior, where models with high correlations still miss key transient structures and integral quantities. Taken together, REALM exposes the limits of current neural surrogates on realistic multiphysics flows and offers a rigorous testbed to drive the development of next-generation physics-aware architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of multi-UAV systems in smart agriculture for tasks like data collection, image acquisition, and communication by improving trajectory planning.

Method: The paper proposes the Elite Imitation Actor-Shared Ensemble Critic (EIA-SEC) framework, which models the problem as a Markov decision process, employs adaptive learning from elite agents, and uses a shared ensemble critic with local critics.

Result: Experimental results show that EIA-SEC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reward performance, training stability, and convergence speed.

Conclusion: The EIA-SEC framework effectively addresses multi-UAV trajectory planning in smart agriculture, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The widespread application of wireless communication technology has promoted the development of smart agriculture, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a multifunctional role. We target a multi-UAV smart agriculture system where UAVs cooperatively perform data collection, image acquisition, and communication tasks. In this context, we model a Markov decision process to solve the multi-UAV trajectory planning problem. Moreover, we propose a novel Elite Imitation Actor-Shared Ensemble Critic (EIA-SEC) framework, where agents adaptively learn from the elite agent to reduce trial-and-error costs, and a shared ensemble critic collaborates with each agent's local critic to ensure unbiased objective value estimates and prevent overestimation. Experimental results demonstrate that EIA-SEC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of reward performance, training stability, and convergence speed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory planning for UAVs in smart agriculture is challenging due to high environmental uncertainty, partial observations, and limited battery capacity.

Result: ITDQN outperforms DDQN by 4.43% in weed recognition rate and 6.94% in data collection rate.

Conclusion: The proposed solution is effective and demonstrates superior performance in both simulated and real-world environments.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising auxiliary platform for smart agriculture, capable of simultaneously performing weed detection, recognition, and data collection from wireless sensors. However, trajectory planning for UAV-based smart agriculture is challenging due to the high uncertainty of the environment, partial observations, and limited battery capacity of UAVs. To address these issues, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve it. Furthermore, we propose a novel imitation-based triple deep Q-network (ITDQN) algorithm, which employs an elite imitation mechanism to reduce exploration costs and utilizes a mediator Q-network over a double deep Q-network (DDQN) to accelerate and stabilize training and improve performance. Experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. Moreover, our proposed ITDQN outperforms DDQN by 4.43\% in weed recognition rate and 6.94\% in data collection rate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DNNs exhibit a universal interaction bottleneck where they easily learn low-order and high-order interactions but consistently under-represent mid-order interactions due to high contextual variability and gradient variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how DNNs encode interactions under different contextual complexity levels and how these microscopic patterns shape macroscopic representation capacity.

Method: Used multi-order interactions to quantify contextual complexity, empirically studied interaction structures across architectures/tasks, theoretically analyzed gradient variance, and introduced loss functions to modulate interaction emphasis.

Result: Discovered universal interaction bottleneck in DNNs, explained it theoretically through contextual variability, and showed that emphasizing different interaction orders affects model properties: low-order emphasis improves generalization/robustness, high-order emphasis enhances structural modeling/fitting.

Conclusion: Interaction order serves as a powerful lens for interpreting and guiding deep representations, revealing inherent representational bias in modern DNNs.

Abstract: Understanding what kinds of cooperative structures deep neural networks (DNNs) can represent remains a fundamental yet insufficiently understood problem. In this work, we treat interactions as the fundamental units of such structure and investigate a largely unexplored question: how DNNs encode interactions under different levels of contextual complexity, and how these microscopic interaction patterns shape macroscopic representation capacity. To quantify this complexity, we use multi-order interactions [57], where each order reflects the amount of contextual information required to evaluate the joint interaction utility of a variable pair. This formulation enables a stratified analysis of cooperative patterns learned by DNNs. Building on this formulation, we develop a comprehensive study of interaction structure in DNNs. (i) We empirically discover a universal interaction bottleneck: across architectures and tasks, DNNs easily learn low-order and high-order interactions but consistently under-represent mid-order ones. (ii) We theoretically explain this bottleneck by proving that mid-order interactions incur the highest contextual variability, yielding large gradient variance and making them intrinsically difficult to learn. (iii) We further modulate the bottleneck by introducing losses that steer models toward emphasizing interactions of selected orders. Finally, we connect microscopic interaction structures with macroscopic representational behavior: low-order-emphasized models exhibit stronger generalization and robustness, whereas high-order-emphasized models demonstrate greater structural modeling and fitting capability. Together, these results uncover an inherent representational bias in modern DNNs and establish interaction order as a powerful lens for interpreting and guiding deep representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the bias in time series models from using point-wise loss functions (e.g., MSE) that assume i.i.d. data, ignoring temporal structure. It formalizes Expectation of Optimization Bias (EOB), quantifies it based on sequence length and Structural SNR, and proposes a debiasing method via sequence length reduction and structural orthogonalization using transforms like DFT/DWT, with experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point-wise loss functions for time series optimization rely on a flawed i.i.d. assumption, disregarding causal temporal structure, which has growing awareness but lacks formal theoretical grounding. The paper aims to provide theoretical analysis of this bias.

Method: Focuses on independence issues under covariance stationarity, formalizes Expectation of Optimization Bias (EOB) information-theoretically, quantifies it via closed-form derivations for linear and non-linear systems based on sequence length and Structural SNR, and proposes a debiasing program.

Result: Analysis reveals a paradox: more deterministic and structured time series lead to more severe bias with point-wise loss functions. EOB is shown to be an intrinsic data property driven by sequence length and SSNR, motivating a principled debiasing approach.

Conclusion: EB Theory provides a rigorous foundation for bias in time series modeling, and the debiasing program (via DFT/DWT and harmonized norms) effectively eliminates bias, validated by extensive experiments with superior performance.

Abstract: Optimizing time series models via point-wise loss functions (e.g., MSE) relying on a flawed point-wise independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption that disregards the causal temporal structure, an issue with growing awareness yet lacking formal theoretical grounding. Focusing on the core independence issue under covariance stationarity, this paper aims to provide a first-principles analysis of the Expectation of Optimization Bias (EOB), formalizing it information-theoretically as the discrepancy between the true joint distribution and its flawed i.i.d. counterpart. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigm paradox: the more deterministic and structured the time series, the more severe the bias by point-wise loss function. We derive the first closed-form quantification for the non-deterministic EOB across linear and non-linear systems, and prove EOB is an intrinsic data property, governed exclusively by sequence length and our proposed Structural Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR). This theoretical diagnosis motivates our principled debiasing program that eliminates the bias through sequence length reduction and structural orthogonalization. We present a concrete solution that simultaneously achieves both principles via DFT or DWT. Furthermore, a novel harmonized $\ell_p$ norm framework is proposed to rectify gradient pathologies of high-variance series. Extensive experiments validate EOB Theory's generality and the superior performance of debiasing program.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARC framework learns disentangled attribute representations for VRPs enabling cross-problem generalization via invariant and contextual embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world VRPs have diverse attributes; need cross-problem learning to generalize across variants efficiently. Current approaches lack ability to reuse invariant semantics across problems or construct representations for unseen attribute combinations.

Method: Framework learns disentangled attribute representations with Intrinsic Attribute Embedding (invariant semantics) and Contextual Interaction Embedding (attribute-combination effects) using analogical consistency to enforce invariant semantic transformations.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on in-distribution, zero-shot generalization, few-shot adaptation, and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARC achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple generalization benchmarks and effectively handles real-world constraints, demonstrating the power of compositional attribute learning.

Abstract: Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) with diverse real-world attributes have driven recent interest in cross-problem learning approaches that efficiently generalize across problem variants. We propose ARC (Attribute Representation via Compositional Learning), a cross-problem learning framework that learns disentangled attribute representations by decomposing them into two complementary components: an Intrinsic Attribute Embedding (IAE) for invariant attribute semantics and a Contextual Interaction Embedding (CIE) for attribute-combination effects. This disentanglement is achieved by enforcing analogical consistency in the embedding space to ensure the semantic transformation of adding an attribute (e.g., a length constraint) remains invariant across different problem contexts. This enables our model to reuse invariant semantics across trained variants and construct representations for unseen combinations. ARC achieves state-of-the-art performance across in-distribution, zero-shot generalization, few-shot adaptation, and real-world benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper studies how pretraining data distribution influences whether a shallow transformer learns generalizable algorithms like induction heads or positional shortcuts, proving a transition based on sequence diversity and offering guidelines for controlling transformer behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the choice of pretraining data distribution steers shallow transformers toward either generalizable algorithmic mechanisms (e.g., induction heads) or simple positional shortcuts, addressing the algorithmic biases in learned behaviors.

Method: Analysis of gradient-based training of a single-layer transformer on a minimal trigger-output prediction task, using theoretical proofs in infinite and finite sample regimes and controlled synthetic experiments.

Result: A transition is proved: with low max-sum ratio (sufficient diversity), models implement induction heads and generalize OOD; with high ratio, they resort to positional shortcuts and fail to generalize. Optimal pretraining distribution is derived to minimize computational cost.

Conclusion: Pretraining data distribution critically impacts transformer behavior, with broader context distributions inducing induction heads and enabling OOD generalization, offering guidelines for controlling transformer learning.

Abstract: Transformers can implement both generalizable algorithms (e.g., induction heads) and simple positional shortcuts (e.g., memorizing fixed output positions). In this work, we study how the choice of pretraining data distribution steers a shallow transformer toward one behavior or the other. Focusing on a minimal trigger-output prediction task -- copying the token immediately following a special trigger upon its second occurrence -- we present a rigorous analysis of gradient-based training of a single-layer transformer. In both the infinite and finite sample regimes, we prove a transition in the learned mechanism: if input sequences exhibit sufficient diversity, measured by a low ``max-sum'' ratio of trigger-to-trigger distances, the trained model implements an induction head and generalizes to unseen contexts; by contrast, when this ratio is large, the model resorts to a positional shortcut and fails to generalize out-of-distribution (OOD). We also reveal a trade-off between the pretraining context length and OOD generalization, and derive the optimal pretraining distribution that minimizes computational cost per sample. Finally, we validate our theoretical predictions with controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating that broadening context distributions robustly induces induction heads and enables OOD generalization. Our results shed light on the algorithmic biases of pretrained transformers and offer conceptual guidelines for data-driven control of their learned behaviors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGCRL improves continual RL by using a dynamic demonstration repository to guide exploration, balancing stability and plasticity for better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL struggles in dynamic environments, and while continual RL enables adaptation, existing methods poorly manage the stability-plasticity dilemma, hindering effective knowledge reuse and efficient learning.

Method: DGCRL uses an external, self-evolving demonstration repository that dynamically selects relevant demonstrations for each task, following a curriculum-based strategy that shifts from demonstration-guided exploration to self-exploration.

Result: Experiments on 2D navigation and MuJoCo locomotion tasks show superior average performance, enhanced knowledge transfer, mitigated forgetting, and improved training efficiency.

Conclusion: DGCRL effectively addresses the stability-plasticity trade-off in continual RL by leveraging a self-evolving demonstration repository, enabling efficient knowledge reuse and adaptation across tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) excels in various applications but struggles in dynamic environments where the underlying Markov decision process evolves. Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) enables RL agents to continually learn and adapt to new tasks, but balancing stability (preserving prior knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge) remains challenging. Existing methods primarily address the stability-plasticity dilemma through mechanisms where past knowledge influences optimization but rarely affects the agent's behavior directly, which may hinder effective knowledge reuse and efficient learning. In contrast, we propose demonstration-guided continual reinforcement learning (DGCRL), which stores prior knowledge in an external, self-evolving demonstration repository that directly guides RL exploration and adaptation. For each task, the agent dynamically selects the most relevant demonstration and follows a curriculum-based strategy to accelerate learning, gradually shifting from demonstration-guided exploration to fully self-exploration. Extensive experiments on 2D navigation and MuJoCo locomotion tasks demonstrate its superior average performance, enhanced knowledge transfer, mitigation of forgetting, and training efficiency. The additional sensitivity analysis and ablation study further validate its effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance anomaly identification in scheduling behaviors by capturing global relationships and addressing complex scenarios like multi-task concurrency and resource competition.

Method: Uses a structure-guided scheduling graph construction mechanism integrating task stages, resource states, and path info, with a multi-scale graph semantic aggregation module for feature consistency.

Result: Model shows significant performance advantages on real scheduling datasets with disturbance paths, with sensitive response to structural and semantic anomalies, and strong anomaly separability in visualization.

Conclusion: The method is effective and adaptable for scheduling anomaly detection, validated by experimental results demonstrating improved representation and separability.

Abstract: This paper proposes a structure-aware driven scheduling graph modeling method to improve the accuracy and representation capability of anomaly identification in scheduling behaviors of complex systems. The method first designs a structure-guided scheduling graph construction mechanism that integrates task execution stages, resource node states, and scheduling path information to build dynamically evolving scheduling behavior graphs, enhancing the model's ability to capture global scheduling relationships. On this basis, a multi-scale graph semantic aggregation module is introduced to achieve semantic consistency modeling of scheduling features through local adjacency semantic integration and global topology alignment, thereby strengthening the model's capability to capture abnormal features in complex scenarios such as multi-task concurrency, resource competition, and stage transitions. Experiments are conducted on a real scheduling dataset with multiple scheduling disturbance paths set to simulate different types of anomalies, including structural shifts, resource changes, and task delays. The proposed model demonstrates significant performance advantages across multiple metrics, showing a sensitive response to structural disturbances and semantic shifts. Further visualization analysis reveals that, under the combined effect of structure guidance and semantic aggregation, the scheduling behavior graph exhibits stronger anomaly separability and pattern representation, validating the effectiveness and adaptability of the method in scheduling anomaly detection tasks.

To address the inherent spatiotemporal heterogeneity of EEG signals, this paper proposes a multi-branch parallel architecture, where each temporal scale is equipped with an independent spatial feature extraction module. To further enhance multi-branch feature fusion, we propose a Fusion of Multiscale Features via Centralized Sparse-attention Network (EEG-CSANet), a centralized sparse-attention network. It employs a main-auxiliary branch architecture, where the main branch models core spatiotemporal patterns via multiscale self-attention, and the auxiliary branch facilitates efficient local interactions through sparse cross-attention. Experimental results show that EEG-CSANet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across five public datasets (BCIC-IV-2A, BCIC-IV-2B, HGD, SEED, and SEED-VIG), with accuracies of 88.54%, 91.09%, 99.43%, 96.03%, and 90.56%, respectively. Such performance demonstrates its strong adaptability and robustness across various EEG decoding tasks. Moreover, extensive ablation studies are conducted to enhance the interpretability of EEG-CSANet. In the future, we hope that EEG-CSANet could serve as a promising baseline model in the field of EEG signal decoding.

### [115] [Generating Risky Samples with Conformity Constraints via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18722)
*Han Yu,Hao Zou,Xingxuan Zhang,Zhengyi Wang,Yue He,Kehan Li,Peng Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RiskyDiff generates diverse, category-conformant risky samples using multimodal constraints and scoring, outperforming prior methods and boosting model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks can fail on risky samples; existing methods for generating them struggle with category conformity, limiting effectiveness.

Method: RiskyDiff uses text and image embeddings as implicit constraints, a conformity score for explicit category alignment, plus embedding screening and risky gradient guidance.

Result: RiskyDiff outperforms existing methods in risk degree, quality, and category conformity, and improves model generalization when augmenting training data.

Conclusion: RiskyDiff successfully generates diverse, risky samples with high conformity to target categories, enhancing model generalization when used for data augmentation.

Abstract: Although neural networks achieve promising performance in many tasks, they may still fail when encountering some examples and bring about risks to applications. To discover risky samples, previous literature attempts to search for patterns of risky samples within existing datasets or inject perturbation into them. Yet in this way the diversity of risky samples is limited by the coverage of existing datasets. To overcome this limitation, recent works adopt diffusion models to produce new risky samples beyond the coverage of existing datasets. However, these methods struggle in the conformity between generated samples and expected categories, which could introduce label noise and severely limit their effectiveness in applications. To address this issue, we propose RiskyDiff that incorporates the embeddings of both texts and images as implicit constraints of category conformity. We also design a conformity score to further explicitly strengthen the category conformity, as well as introduce the mechanisms of embedding screening and risky gradient guidance to boost the risk of generated samples. Extensive experiments reveal that RiskyDiff greatly outperforms existing methods in terms of the degree of risk, generation quality, and conformity with conditioned categories. We also empirically show the generalization ability of the models can be enhanced by augmenting training data with generated samples of high conformity.

### [116] [ML Inference Scheduling with Predictable Latency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18725)
*Haidong Zhao,Nikolaos Georgantas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Existing ML inference scheduling approaches have coarse-grained, static interference prediction models that are inadequate for handling concurrent task interference, leading to potential SLO violations. The paper evaluates these limitations and outlines ongoing work towards more efficient scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of scheduling ML inference requests on GPUs where improving utilization can compromise latency-sensitive scheduling due to interference between concurrent tasks. Existing interference prediction approaches are inadequate because they are coarse-grained and static, leading to inaccurate predictions and potential SLO/deadline violations.

Method: The paper evaluates the limitations of existing interference prediction approaches, highlighting their coarse-grained nature and static prediction models. It discusses the need for considering runtime co-location dynamics and adaptive models to better cope with varying workload characteristics.

Result: The analysis identifies key limitations in current interference prediction methods: (1) they are coarse-grained, ignoring runtime co-location dynamics, and (2) they use static prediction models that fail to adapt to different workload characteristics. These limitations restrict their usefulness for effective scheduling.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that more fine-grained and adaptive interference prediction approaches are needed to overcome the limitations of current methods, and outlines ongoing work towards achieving efficient ML inference scheduling that can handle concurrent task interference.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) inference serving systems can schedule requests to improve GPU utilization and to meet service level objectives (SLOs) or deadlines. However, improving GPU utilization may compromise latency-sensitive scheduling, as concurrent tasks contend for GPU resources and thereby introduce interference. Given that interference effects introduce unpredictability in scheduling, neglecting them may compromise SLO or deadline satisfaction. Nevertheless, existing interference prediction approaches remain limited in several respects, which may restrict their usefulness for scheduling. First, they are often coarse-grained, which ignores runtime co-location dynamics and thus restricts their accuracy in interference prediction. Second, they tend to use a static prediction model, which may not effectively cope with different workload characteristics. To this end, we evaluate the potential limitations of existing interference prediction approaches and outline our ongoing work toward achieving efficient ML inference scheduling.

### [117] [A Theoretical Lens for RL-Tuned Language Models via Energy-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18730)
*Zhiquan Tan,Yinrong Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Variational analysis reveals that KL-regularized RL yields detailed balance (ensuring monotonic convergence) and expected KL minimization (clarifying accuracy–entropy tradeoff), unifying theoretical understanding of instruction-following and reasoning LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While instruction-following and reasoning abilities of LLMs trained with KL-regularized reinforcement learning are empirically strong, their theoretical understanding is limited. This work aims to establish a rigorous variational analysis that unifies and explains the success of such alignment methods.

Method: The method employs a unified variational analysis of LLMs based on the closed-form energy-based model (EBM) structure of the optimal KL-regularized policy. For instruction-tuned models, assumptions on reward potentials and pretraining symmetry lead to detailed balance and spectral analysis. For reasoning models (RLVR), the objective is expressed as expected KL minimization, with suboptimality gap analysis via Bernoulli KL.

Result: 1. For instruction-tuned models, under natural assumptions, the transition kernel satisfies detailed balance relative to a scalar potential encoding response quality. This leads to monotonic KL convergence to a high-quality stationary distribution, bounded hitting times to superior states, and exponential mixing ruled by spectral gap.
2. For reasoning models trained with verifiable rewards (RLVR), the objective is equivalent to expected KL minimization toward an optimal reasoning distribution. The suboptimality gap reduces to the Bernoulli KL between target and current accuracies under the natural gradient flow, which clarifies entropy-accuracy trade-offs observed empirically.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the variational analysis reveals the deep structure of KL-regularized RL for LLMs, explaining alignment success (monotonic convergence and hitting times) and reasoning performance (KL minimization). Future directions include studying generalization beyond IID, the role of finite samples, and connections to online learning and classical statistics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained via KL-regularized reinforcement learning demonstrate strong instruction following, self-correction, and reasoning abilities. Yet their theoretical underpinnings remain limited. We exploit the closed-form energy-based model (EBM) structure of the optimal KL-regularized policy to provide a unified variational analysis of LLMs.
  For instruction-tuned models, under natural assumptions on reward potentials and pretraining symmetry, we prove that the transition kernel satisfies detailed balance with respect to a scalar potential encoding response quality. This yields monotonic KL convergence to a high-quality stationary distribution, bounded hitting times to superior states, and exponential mixing governed by the spectral gap.
  For reasoning models trained with verifiable rewards (RLVR), we show the objective is equivalent to expected KL minimization toward an optimal reasoning distribution, with the suboptimality gap reducing to the Bernoulli KL between target and current accuracies along the natural gradient flow. This helps explain empirical entropy-accuracy trade-offs.

### [118] [Is Your Conditional Diffusion Model Actually Denoising?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18736)
*Daniel Pfrommer,Zehao Dou,Christopher Scarvelis,Max Simchowitz,Ali Jadbabaie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates why diffusion models with conditioning (like text-to-image or control policies) don't follow the ideal 'denoising' process during generation, showing this deviation is inherent and caused by an inductive bias towards smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models with conditioning are widely used but exhibit inconsistencies in conditional generation, leading to disagreements between sampling methods like DDPM and DDIM. The authors aim to understand why these models deviate from the theoretical denoising framework.

Method: The authors introduce 'Schedule Deviation' as a measure to quantify the rate of deviation from standard denoising and provide a methodology to compute it. They analyze models empirically and theoretically to link the deviation to inductive biases.

Result: The study finds that deviation from idealized denoising occurs regardless of model capacity or training data, and posits it arises from the difficulty of aligning denoising flows across different conditioning spaces, driven by an inductive bias towards smoothness.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the deviation in conditional diffusion models is an inherent structural issue, not due to insufficient training, and highlights the role of smoothness biases, suggesting implications for improving sampling algorithms and understanding model behavior.

Abstract: We study the inductive biases of diffusion models with a conditioning-variable, which have seen widespread application as both text-conditioned generative image models and observation-conditioned continuous control policies. We observe that when these models are queried conditionally, their generations consistently deviate from the idealized "denoising" process upon which diffusion models are formulated, inducing disagreement between popular sampling algorithms (e.g. DDPM, DDIM). We introduce Schedule Deviation, a rigorous measure which captures the rate of deviation from a standard denoising process, and provide a methodology to compute it. Crucially, we demonstrate that the deviation from an idealized denoising process occurs irrespective of the model capacity or amount of training data. We posit that this phenomenon occurs due to the difficulty of bridging distinct denoising flows across different parts of the conditioning space and show theoretically how such a phenomenon can arise through an inductive bias towards smoothness.

### [119] [PIPCFR: Pseudo-outcome Imputation with Post-treatment Variables for Individual Treatment Effect Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18737)
*Zichuan Lin,Xiaokai Huang,Jiate Liu,Yuxuan Han,Jia Chen,Xiapeng Wu,Deheng Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method, PIPCFR, is introduced to improve individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation by incorporating post-treatment variables into pseudo-outcome imputation, addressing limitations in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for ITE estimation often overlook post-treatment variables, which can affect outcome variability, leading to increased variance in counterfactual predictions and reduced accuracy.

Method: PIPCFR integrates post-treatment variables to enhance pseudo-outcome imputation, analyzes their challenges, establishes a theoretical bound linking them to ITE accuracy, and learns unbiased representations.

Result: Empirical evaluations on real-world and simulated datasets show that PIPCFR achieves significantly lower ITE errors compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating post-treatment variables via PIPCFR improves ITE estimation accuracy by better capturing outcome variability, as supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results.

Abstract: The estimation of individual treatment effects (ITE) focuses on predicting the outcome changes that result from a change in treatment. A fundamental challenge in observational data is that while we need to infer outcome differences under alternative treatments, we can only observe each individual's outcome under a single treatment. Existing approaches address this limitation either by training with inferred pseudo-outcomes or by creating matched instance pairs. However, recent work has largely overlooked the potential impact of post-treatment variables on the outcome. This oversight prevents existing methods from fully capturing outcome variability, resulting in increased variance in counterfactual predictions. This paper introduces Pseudo-outcome Imputation with Post-treatment Variables for Counterfactual Regression (PIPCFR), a novel approach that incorporates post-treatment variables to improve pseudo-outcome imputation. We analyze the challenges inherent in utilizing post-treatment variables and establish a novel theoretical bound for ITE risk that explicitly connects post-treatment variables to ITE estimation accuracy. Unlike existing methods that ignore these variables or impose restrictive assumptions, PIPCFR learns effective representations that preserve informative components while mitigating bias. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate that PIPCFR achieves significantly lower ITE errors compared to existing methods.

### [120] [Gaussian-Mixture-Model Q-Functions for Policy Iteration in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18763)
*Minh Vu,Konstantinos Slavakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GMMs are repurposed as direct Q-function surrogates (GMM-QFs), offering universal approximation, Riemannian optimization, and competitive RL performance with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore a novel use of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) beyond their traditional role as probability density estimators in reinforcement learning. It seeks to leverage the representational capacity of GMMs to approximate Q-functions directly, potentially offering a more efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to deep-learning methods.

Method: GMMs are used as direct surrogates for Q-function losses instead of density estimators. These GMM-QFs, with learnable parameters (mixing weights, Gaussian means, and covariances), are embedded within Bellman residuals and optimized on a Riemannian manifold. This approach integrates Riemannian optimization into the policy-evaluation step of standard policy-iteration frameworks.

Result: Theoretical results establish GMM-QFs as universal approximators over a broad class of functions. Numerical experiments show that GMM-QFs deliver competitive performance and sometimes outperform state-of-the-art approaches across benchmark RL tasks, all while maintaining a significantly smaller computational footprint than deep-learning methods that require experience data.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that GMM-QFs provide a powerful, geometrically-inspired approach to RL that combines theoretical soundness with practical efficiency and competitive performance, positioning them as a promising alternative to traditional deep-learning methods.

Abstract: Unlike their conventional use as estimators of probability density functions in reinforcement learning (RL), this paper introduces a novel function-approximation role for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as direct surrogates for Q-function losses. These parametric models, termed GMM-QFs, possess substantial representational capacity, as they are shown to be universal approximators over a broad class of functions. They are further embedded within Bellman residuals, where their learnable parameters -- a fixed number of mixing weights, together with Gaussian mean vectors and covariance matrices -- are inferred from data via optimization on a Riemannian manifold. This geometric perspective on the parameter space naturally incorporates Riemannian optimization into the policy-evaluation step of standard policy-iteration frameworks. Rigorous theoretical results are established, and supporting numerical tests show that, even without access to experience data, GMM-QFs deliver competitive performance and, in some cases, outperform state-of-the-art approaches across a range of benchmark RL tasks, all while maintaining a significantly smaller computational footprint than deep-learning methods that rely on experience data.

TL;DR: The paper proposes GDOF, a label-informed outlier detection method using Granular Computing and Fuzzy Sets to handle heterogeneous data with minimal labeled outliers, showing superior performance on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised outlier detection methods treat data as purely numerical and deterministic, ignoring heterogeneity and uncertainty in complex real-world datasets.

Method: GDOF uses label-informed fuzzy granulation to represent data types, develops granule density for density estimation, and integrates densities from attributes with attribute relevance assessment using labeled outliers.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show GDOF excels in detecting outliers in heterogeneous data with few labeled outliers.

Conclusion: GDOF integrates Fuzzy Sets and Granular Computing for a practical framework in complex data, with datasets and code publicly available.

Abstract: Outlier detection, crucial for identifying unusual patterns with significant implications across numerous applications, has drawn considerable research interest. Existing semi-supervised methods typically treat data as purely numerical and} in a deterministic manner, thereby neglecting the heterogeneity and uncertainty inherent in complex, real-world datasets. This paper introduces a label-informed outlier detection method for heterogeneous data based on Granular Computing and Fuzzy Sets, namely Granule Density-based Outlier Factor (GDOF). Specifically, GDOF first employs label-informed fuzzy granulation to effectively represent various data types and develops granule density for precise density estimation. Subsequently, granule densities from individual attributes are integrated for outlier scoring by assessing attribute relevance with a limited number of labeled outliers. Experimental results on various real-world datasets show that GDOF stands out in detecting outliers in heterogeneous data with a minimal number of labeled outliers. The integration of Fuzzy Sets and Granular Computing in GDOF offers a practical framework for outlier detection in complex and diverse data types. All relevant datasets and source codes are publicly available for further research. This is the author's accepted manuscript of a paper published in IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems.

TL;DR: SDL converts deterministic ML weather models into probabilistic ensembles with minimal cost and interpretable uncertainty, achieving competitive calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CRPS ensemble approaches are computationally expensive and lack physical interpretability due to global noise injection through conditional normalization.

Method: Introduces Stochastic Decomposition Layers (SDL) adapted from StyleGAN, applying learned perturbations at three decoder scales via latent-driven modulation, per-pixel noise, and channel scaling, and applied to WXFormer via transfer learning.

Result: SDL requires <2% of baseline computational cost, produces ensembles with spread-skill ratios near unity and progressively flattening rank histograms, achieves calibration competitive with operational IFS-ENS, and reveals hierarchical uncertainty across scales.

Conclusion: SDL provides an efficient, interpretable alternative to current ensemble methods, enabling well-calibrated probabilistic weather predictions with minimal computational cost and clear physical interpretability.

Abstract: AI weather prediction ensembles with latent noise injection and optimized with the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) have produced both accurate and well-calibrated predictions with far less computational cost compared with diffusion-based methods. However, current CRPS ensemble approaches vary in their training strategies and noise injection mechanisms, with most injecting noise globally throughout the network via conditional normalization. This structure increases training expense and limits the physical interpretability of the stochastic perturbations. We introduce Stochastic Decomposition Layers (SDL) for converting deterministic machine learning weather models into probabilistic ensemble systems. Adapted from StyleGAN's hierarchical noise injection, SDL applies learned perturbations at three decoder scales through latent-driven modulation, per-pixel noise, and channel scaling. When applied to WXFormer via transfer learning, SDL requires less than 2\% of the computational cost needed to train the baseline model. Each ensemble member is generated from a compact latent tensor (5 MB), enabling perfect reproducibility and post-inference spread adjustment through latent rescaling. Evaluation on 2022 ERA5 reanalysis shows ensembles with spread-skill ratios approaching unity and rank histograms that progressively flatten toward uniformity through medium-range forecasts, achieving calibration competitive with operational IFS-ENS. Multi-scale experiments reveal hierarchical uncertainty: coarse layers modulate synoptic patterns while fine layers control mesoscale variability. The explicit latent parameterization provides interpretable uncertainty quantification for operational forecasting and climate applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a generative modeling framework that accelerates Wasserstein gradient descent by leveraging spectral structure that can be directly estimated from data, removing the need for explicit knowledge of target potential or neural network training.

Method: The method combines operator-theoretic spectral analysis via Koopman operator approximation with Wasserstein gradient descent. It estimates spectral structure from trajectory data through Koopman operator approximation, eliminating the need for explicit knowledge of target potential or neural network training.

Result: KSWGD consistently achieves faster convergence than other existing methods while maintaining high sample quality across diverse settings including compact manifold sampling, metastable multi-well systems, image generation, and high-dimensional stochastic partial differential equations.

Conclusion: The Koopman Spectral Wasserstein Gradient Descent (KSWGD) framework successfully combines operator-theoretic spectral analysis with optimal transport to create an efficient generative modeling approach that achieves accelerated convergence while maintaining high sample quality across diverse settings.

Abstract: We propose Koopman Spectral Wasserstein Gradient Descent (KSWGD), a generative modeling framework that combines operator-theoretic spectral analysis with optimal transport. The novel insight is that the spectral structure required for accelerated Wasserstein gradient descent can be directly estimated from trajectory data via Koopman operator approximation which can eliminate the need for explicit knowledge of the target potential or neural network training. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and establish connection to Feynman-Kac theory that clarifies the method's probabilistic foundation. Experiments across diverse settings, including compact manifold sampling, metastable multi-well systems, image generation, and high dimensional stochastic partial differential equation, demonstrate that KSWGD consistently achieves faster convergence than other existing methods while maintaining high sample quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate training in neural networks by leveraging disjoint dataset training, specifically targeting performance improvements beyond federated learning convergence goals.

Method: The study employs Newton-Kaczmarz optimization method with piecewise-linear basis functions in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for training on disjoint datasets or subsets.

Result: Experimental comparisons show that training on disjoint datasets further improves performance compared to existing fastest combinations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that training on disjoint datasets with KANs using Newton-Kaczmarz method and piecewise-linear basis functions provides significant performance improvements for acceleration purposes, and makes all corresponding codes publicly available.

Abstract: Training on disjoint datasets can serve two primary goals: accelerating data processing and enabling federated learning. It has already been established that Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are particularly well suited for federated learning and can be merged through simple parameter averaging. While the federated learning literature has mostly focused on achieving training convergence across distributed nodes, the present paper specifically targets acceleration of the training, which depends critically on the choice of an optimisation method and the type of the basis functions. To the best knowledge of the authors, the fastest currently-available combination is the Newton-Kaczmarz method and the piecewise-linear basis functions. Here, it is shown that training on disjoint datasets (or disjoint subsets of the training dataset) can further improve the performance. Experimental comparisons are provided, and all corresponding codes are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical nonlinear filters like ensemble Kalman and particle filters in handling highly nonlinear dynamics and structural errors, aiming for a more robust and efficient solution.

Method: Marries standard prediction procedures with diffusion generative modeling for the analysis step in filtering, eliminating structural model error.

Result: Performs well in mildly high dimensions (up to 40 or above) under chaotic environments, outperforming ensemble Kalman and particle filters in tests with varying nonlinearity levels.

Conclusion: The filter is effective for nonlinear dynamics and shows promise for practical applications, with future work focusing on extension to meteorological uses and convergence analysis.

Abstract: This work puts forward a novel nonlinear optimal filter namely the Ensemble Schr{ö}dinger Bridge nonlinear filter. The proposed filter finds marriage of the standard prediction procedure and the diffusion generative modeling for the analysis procedure to realize one filtering step. The designed approach finds no structural model error, and it is derivative free, training free and highly parallizable. Experimental results show that the designed algorithm performs well given highly nonlinear dynamics in (mildly) high dimension up to 40 or above under a chaotic environment. It also shows better performance than classical methods such as the ensemble Kalman filter and the Particle filter in numerous tests given different level of nonlinearity. Future work will focus on extending the proposed approach to practical meteorological applications and establishing a rigorous convergence analysis.

### [127] [DPSR: Differentially Private Sparse Reconstruction via Multi-Stage Denoising for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18932)
*Sarwan Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPSR is a differentially private recommender system method using a three-stage denoising framework to improve privacy-utility tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing differential privacy mechanisms degrade recommendation quality as privacy budgets tighten due to the privacy-utility tradeoff.

Method: DPSR employs a three-stage process: information-theoretic noise calibration, collaborative filtering-based denoising, and low-rank matrix completion, all applied after noise injection to preserve privacy.

Result: DPSR achieves 5.57% to 9.23% RMSE improvement over state-of-the-art Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms across privacy budgets (ε=0.1 to ε=10.0), with significant statistical results, and outperforms non-private baselines at ε=1.0.

Conclusion: DPSR effectively addresses the privacy-utility tradeoff by denoising both privacy-induced and inherent data noise, serving as a regularizer that can enhance recommendation quality even under strict privacy constraints.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as the gold standard for protecting user data in recommender systems, but existing privacy-preserving mechanisms face a fundamental challenge: the privacy-utility tradeoff inevitably degrades recommendation quality as privacy budgets tighten. We introduce DPSR (Differentially Private Sparse Reconstruction), a novel three-stage denoising framework that fundamentally addresses this limitation by exploiting the inherent structure of rating matrices -- sparsity, low-rank properties, and collaborative patterns.
  DPSR consists of three synergistic stages: (1) \textit{information-theoretic noise calibration} that adaptively reduces noise for high-information ratings, (2) \textit{collaborative filtering-based denoising} that leverages item-item similarities to remove privacy noise, and (3) \textit{low-rank matrix completion} that exploits latent structure for signal recovery. Critically, all denoising operations occur \textit{after} noise injection, preserving differential privacy through the post-processing immunity theorem while removing both privacy-induced and inherent data noise.
  Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled ground truth, we demonstrate that DPSR achieves 5.57\% to 9.23\% RMSE improvement over state-of-the-art Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms across privacy budgets ranging from $\varepsilon=0.1$ to $\varepsilon=10.0$ (all improvements statistically significant with $p < 0.05$, most $p < 0.001$). Remarkably, at $\varepsilon=1.0$, DPSR achieves RMSE of 0.9823, \textit{outperforming even the non-private baseline} (1.0983), demonstrating that our denoising pipeline acts as an effective regularizer that removes data noise in addition to privacy noise.

### [128] [When Less is More: 8-bit Quantization Improves Continual Learning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18934)
*Michael S. Zhang,Rishi A. Ruia,Arnav Kewalram,Saathvik Dharmapuram,Utkarsh Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that in continual learning, INT8 quantized models outperform higher precision FP16 on later tasks due to noise acting as regularization against forgetting. Small replay buffers (0.1%-10%) greatly boost retention, challenging the assumption that higher precision is always better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fundamental challenge of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning models, especially when these models are quantized to improve deployment efficiency. The conventional wisdom that higher precision is always better may not hold in such scenarios, so there's a need to understand the interplay between quantization and buffer strategies to achieve better outcomes.

Method: The researchers conducted a systematic investigation into how quantization precision (FP16, INT8, INT4) combined with replay buffer strategies affects continual learning, using different tasks such as NLU, Math, and Code generation. They measured accuracy and retention across tasks, while varying replay buffer sizes from 0.1% to 10%.

Result: Key findings include: FP16 initially performs best on NLU task (74.44%), but later quantized models (INT8, INT4) significantly outperform FP16 on forward accuracy for subsequent tasks, particularly Code generation where INT4 nearly doubles FP16's performance (40% vs 20%). Notably, even minimal replay buffers (0.1%) substantially increase task retention, and INT8 consistently balances learning plasticity and knowledge retention. The study also provides practical guidelines: small replay buffers (1-2%) work for NLU, while Math and Code tasks benefit from moderate buffers (5-10%), with quantized models requiring less replay than FP16 to achieve similar retention.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that for continual learning scenarios, using INT8 quantization strikes an optimal balance—not only being computationally efficient but also providing superior learning dynamics. It highlights how quantization-induced noise serves as implicit regularization to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, which challenges the traditional belief that higher precision is always better for model performance.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting poses a fundamental challenge in continual learning, particularly when models are quantized for deployment efficiency. We systematically investigate the interplay between quantization precision (FP16, INT8, INT4) and replay buffer strategies in large language models, revealing unexpected dynamics. While FP16 achieves superior initial task performance (74.44% on NLU), we observe a striking inversion on subsequent tasks: quantized models outperform FP16 by 8-15% on final task forward accuracy, with INT4 achieving nearly double FP16's performance on Code generation (40% vs 20%). Critically, even minimal replay buffers (0.1%) dramatically improve retention - increasing NLU retention after Math training from 45% to 65% across all precision levels - with INT8 consistently achieving the optimal balance between learning plasticity and knowledge retention. We hypothesize that quantization-induced noise acts as implicit regularization, preventing the overfitting to new task gradients that plagues high-precision models. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that higher precision is always preferable, suggesting instead that INT8 quantization offers both computational efficiency and superior continual learning dynamics. Our results provide practical guidelines for deploying compressed models in continual learning scenarios: small replay buffers (1-2%) suffice for NLU tasks, while Math and Code benefit from moderate buffers (5-10%), with quantized models requiring less replay than FP16 to achieve comparable retention.

TL;DR: MACLA is a framework that separates reasoning from learning by keeping a frozen LLM and using external procedural memory, achieving high performance and efficiency without LLM parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create agents that are sample-efficient, interpretable, and capable of continuous improvement without modifying large language model parameters, addressing inefficiencies in LLM adaptation.

Method: It extracts reusable procedures from trajectories, tracks reliability with Bayesian posteriors, selects actions via expected-utility scoring, and refines procedures by contrasting successes and failures, using an external hierarchical procedural memory.

Result: MACLA achieved 78.1% average performance across four benchmarks, with 90.3% on unseen ALFWorld tasks and 3.1% positive generalization; builds memory 2800x faster than baselines and compresses trajectories into procedures.

Conclusion: Structured external memory with Bayesian selection and contrastive refinement enables effective agents without LLM parameter updates, offering improved performance and interpretability in reasoning.

Abstract: We present MACLA, a framework that decouples reasoning from learning by maintaining a frozen large language model while performing all adaptation in an external hierarchical procedural memory. MACLA extracts reusable procedures from trajectories, tracks reliability via Bayesian posteriors, selects actions through expected-utility scoring, and refines procedures by contrasting successes and failures. Across four benchmarks (ALFWorld, WebShop, TravelPlanner, InterCodeSQL), MACLA achieves 78.1 percent average performance, outperforming all baselines. On ALFWorld unseen tasks, MACLA reaches 90.3 percent with 3.1 percent positive generalization. The system constructs memory in 56 seconds, 2800 times faster than the state-of-the-art LLM parameter-training baseline, compressing 2851 trajectories into 187 procedures. Experimental results demonstrate that structured external memory with Bayesian selection and contrastive refinement enables sample-efficient, interpretable, and continually improving agents without LLM parameter updates.

### [130] [ShibuyaSocial: Multi-scale Model of Pedestrian Flows in Scramble Crossing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18550)
*Akihiro Sakurai,Naoya Kajio,Ko Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A learning-based model for pedestrian flow prediction integrates global route selection and local collision avoidance using Attention, validated at Shibuya crossing to enhance safety by simulating complex behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian congestion, especially at crowded locations like Shibuya scramble crossing, can lead to serious accidents. Existing models often only address local behaviors like collision avoidance, neglecting complex decision-making such as global route selection and traffic light transitions, necessitating an integrated approach for accurate prediction and accident prevention.

Method: The model combines local collision avoidance with global route selection using an Attention mechanism. It was trained on pedestrian trajectory data extracted from video recordings at Shibuya scramble crossing, focusing on multi-scale behaviors and state transitions (e.g., from stopping to walking at traffic lights).

Result: Simulations based on the trained model showed that it can appropriately predict pedestrian behaviors, with qualitative and quantitative validation demonstrating accurate integration of global and local aspects compared to previous methods that focused only on local behaviors.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively integrates multi-scale pedestrian behaviors, enhancing prediction accuracy for complex environments. It offers a valuable tool for improving safety and comfort in urban spaces by preventing congestion-related accidents through better behavioral modeling.

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based model of pedestrian flows that integrates multi scale behaviors such as global route selection and local collision avoidance in urban spaces, particularly focusing on pedestrian movements at Shibuya scramble crossing. Since too much congestion of pedestrian flows can cause serious accidents, mathematically modeling and predicting pedestrian behaviors is important for preventing such accidents and providing a safe and comfortable environment. Although numerous studies have investigated learning-based modeling methods, most of them focus only on the local behavior of pedestrians, such as collision avoidance with neighbors and environmental objects. In an actual environment, pedestrian behavior involves more complicated decision making including global route selection. Moreover, a state transition from stopping to walking at a traffic light should be considered simultaneously. In this study, the proposed model integrates local behaviors with global route selection, using an Attention mechanism to ensure consistent global and local behavior predictions. We recorded video data of pedestrians at Shibuya scramble crossing and trained the proposed model using pedestrian walking trajectory data obtained from the video. Simulations of pedestrian behaviors based on the trained model qualitatively and quantitatively validated that the proposed model can appropriately predict pedestrian behaviors.

### [131] [Adaptive Accountability in Networked MAS: Tracing and Mitigating Emergent Norms at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18561)
*Saad Alqithami*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: An adaptive accountability framework detects harmful emergent norms in multi-agent systems and intervenes to maintain system-level objectives, improving performance and ethics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale networked multi-agent systems can develop undesirable norms that evade governance, requiring new mechanisms to align behaviors.

Method: The framework uses an audit ledger to trace responsibility, decentralized hypothesis tests to detect harmful norms, and local policy/reward interventions for near real-time realignment.

Result: The framework proves bounded compromise, prevents issues like collusion and hoarding in ≥90% of cases, increases collective reward by 12-18%, and reduces inequality by up to 33% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: A theoretically based accountability layer enables ethical, self-regulating behavior in complex multi-agent systems without sacrificing performance or scalability.

Abstract: Large-scale networked multi-agent systems increasingly underpin critical infrastructure, yet their collective behavior can drift toward undesirable emergent norms that elude conventional governance mechanisms. We introduce an adaptive accountability framework that (i) continuously traces responsibility flows through a lifecycle-aware audit ledger, (ii) detects harmful emergent norms online via decentralized sequential hypothesis tests, and (iii) deploys local policy and reward-shaping interventions that realign agents with system-level objectives in near real time. We prove a bounded-compromise theorem showing that whenever the expected intervention cost exceeds an adversary's payoff, the long-run proportion of compromised interactions is bounded by a constant strictly less than one. Extensive high-performance simulations with up to 100 heterogeneous agents, partial observability, and stochastic communication graphs show that our framework prevents collusion and resource hoarding in at least 90% of configurations, boosts average collective reward by 12-18%, and lowers the Gini inequality index by up to 33% relative to a PPO baseline. These results demonstrate that a theoretically principled accountability layer can induce ethically aligned, self-regulating behavior in complex MAS without sacrificing performance or scalability.
