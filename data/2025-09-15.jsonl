Conventional risk analysis frameworks often reduce\ncomplexity to ensure manageability, creating silos that hinder comprehensive\nsolutions. A fundamental shift towards holistic strategies is essential to\nenable effective negotiations between different sectors and to balance the\ncompeting interests of stakeholders.

For comparison, manual drafting times for IND summaries previously\ncleared by the U.S. FDA were estimated from the experience of regulatory\nwriters ($\\geq$6 years) and used as industry-standard benchmarks.

Common\npolicy-based methods are either on-policy and do not effectively learn from\noff-policy data (e.g. PPO), or have poor empirical performance in the\ndiscrete-action setting (e.g. SAC). Consequently, starting from discrete SAC\n(DSAC), we revisit the design of actor-critic methods in this setting. First,\nwe determine that the coupling between the actor and critic entropy is the\nprimary reason behind the poor performance of DSAC. We demonstrate that by\nmerely decoupling these components, DSAC can have comparable performance as\nDQN. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a flexible off-policy actor-critic\nframework that subsumes DSAC as a special case. Our framework allows using an\nm-step Bellman operator for the critic update, and enables combining standard\npolicy optimization methods with entropy regularization to instantiate the\nresulting actor objective. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed methods\ncan guarantee convergence to the optimal regularized value function in the\ntabular setting. Empirically, we demonstrate that these methods can approach\nthe performance of DQN on standard Atari games, and do so even without entropy\nregularization or explicit exploration."}

Despite\nits advantages, FL suffers from substantial communication overhead, which can\naffect training efficiency. Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by\nquantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing\nmethods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization\nerrors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework\nthat directly learns quantized model parameters during local training. In each\ncommunication round, the server first quantizes the model parameters and\ntransmits them to the clients. FedBiF then allows each client to update only a\nsingle bit of the multi-bit parameter representation, freezing the remaining\nbits. This bit-by-bit update strategy reduces each parameter update to one bit\nwhile maintaining high precision in parameter representation. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on five widely used datasets under both IID and\nNon-IID settings. The results demonstrate that FedBiF not only achieves\nsuperior communication compression but also promotes sparsity in the resulting\nmodels.
