Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhysMaster is an autonomous AI physicist agent that integrates abstract reasoning with code-based computation and uses a knowledge system (LANDAU) to accelerate, automate, and autonomously discover solutions to complex physics problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing LLM-based scientific agents that are mainly evaluated on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks, lacking end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios, particularly in physics which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation.

Method: The method involves developing PhysMaster as an LLM-based agent with two main components: (1) coupling abstract reasoning with numerical computation, and (2) leveraging LANDAU (Layered Academic Data Universe) which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy that balances efficiency and open-ended exploration.

Result: The results show that PhysMaster successfully tackles problems across high-energy theory, condensed matter theory, and astrophysics, demonstrating: (i) acceleration by compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; (ii) automation through autonomous execution of hypothesis-driven loops; and (iii) autonomous discovery by independently exploring open problems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that PhysMaster represents a significant advancement in autonomous AI agents for physics research, demonstrating practical acceleration, automation, and autonomous discovery capabilities while addressing key challenges in abstract reasoning, mathematical intensity, and computational integration.

Abstract: Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks. We evaluate PhysMaster on problems from high-energy theory, condensed matter theory to astrophysics, including: (i) acceleration, compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; (ii) automation, autonomously executing hypothesis-driven loops ; and (iii) autonomous discovery, independently exploring open problems.

### [2] [A Branch-and-Price Algorithm for Fast and Equitable Last-Mile Relief Aid Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19882)
*Mahdi Mostajabdaveh,F. Sibel Salman,Walter J. Gutjahr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A bi-objective optimization approach for post-disaster relief distribution that balances efficiency (travel time) and equity (Gini-index of unsatisfied demand) using a MIP model and ε-constraint method with a branch-and-price algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prepositioned disaster supplies are often insufficient, requiring efficient and equitable distribution to shelters while balancing fairness in aid allocation with timely delivery.

Method: Mixed Integer Programming model with ε-constraint method for bi-objective optimization, enhanced with valid inequalities and a branch-and-price algorithm for efficient solution of vehicle routing and supply allocation.

Result: The branch-and-price algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers, reducing aid distribution inequity by 34% without efficiency loss. Lexicographic optimization works best for extreme time constraints, while balanced approach is needed for moderate constraints.

Conclusion: Bi-objective optimization effectively balances efficiency and equity in disaster relief distribution, with the proposed algorithm providing superior performance and actionable insights for different time constraint scenarios.

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

### [3] [Interpolative Decoding: Exploring the Spectrum of Personality Traits in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19937)
*Eric Yeh,John Cadigan,Ran Chen,Dick Crouch,Melinda Gervasio,Dayne Freitag*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using interpolative decoding to simulate human personality traits in LLMs for behavioral studies, enabling continuous personality modulation without needing separate prompts for each profile.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the experimental overhead and replicability issues caused by creating individual prompts for each personality profile in LLM-based human behavior simulations.

Method: Leverage interpolative decoding by representing personality dimensions as pairs of opposed prompts and using interpolation parameters to simulate behavior along each dimension of the Big Five personality traits.

Result: Interpolative decoding reliably modulates personality scores, mimics human decision-making in economic games, and enables systematic "twinning" of individual human players in collaborative games.

Conclusion: Interpolative decoding provides an effective method for simulating continuous personality variations in LLMs, facilitating more scalable and replicable behavioral studies while maintaining fidelity to human psychological research findings.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

*Luciano Araujo Dourado Filho,Almir Moreira da Silva Neto,Rodrigo Pereira David,Rodrigo Tripodi Calumby*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Domain adaptation approach using class prototypes and a customized Vision Transformer with DinoV2 embeddings for multi-label plant species identification, achieving competitive results in PlantCLEF 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge of fine-grained multi-label species identification from high-resolution images of vegetation plots, particularly focusing on domain adaptation from multi-class identification of individual species to multi-label classification of vegetation plots.

Method: The method involves creating class prototypes from training images using K-Means clustering (K equals number of classes). It uses a customized narrow Vision Transformer (ViT) with a frozen DinoV2 patch embedding layer, pre-trained for individual species classification. The ViT is trained to reconstruct class prototypes from test images. Attention scores from the model are then used to identify and localize areas of interest to guide classification.

Result: The method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard with an F1 score of 0.33331, scoring only 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieved competitive performance, ranking fifth in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge, with an F1 score of 0.33331. The approach demonstrates promising results for domain adaptation in fine-grained multi-label species identification from high-resolution vegetation plots.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

### [5] [FGDCC: Fine-Grained Deep Cluster Categorization -- A Framework for Intra-Class Variability Problems in Plant Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19960)
*Luciano Araujo Dourado Filho,Rodrigo Tripodi Calumby*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for Fine-Grained Visual Categorization that uses class-wise clustering to discover pseudo-labels encoding similarity between images, enabling hierarchical classification to learn more fine-grained features and mitigate intra-class variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intra-class variability combined with class underrepresentation in FGVC tasks hinders deep learning model performance. The authors aim to address this challenge by discovering latent similarity patterns within classes.

Method: The method applies clustering over each class individually to discover pseudo-labels that encode latent similarity between images. These pseudo-labels are then used in a hierarchical classification process to learn more fine-grained visual features.

Result: Initial experiments on PlantNet300k showed promising results, achieving state-of-the-art performance even though some components weren't fully optimized. The method sheds light on key points for future development.

Conclusion: The proposed clustering-based hierarchical classification approach shows potential for mitigating intra-class variability in FGVC tasks, with state-of-the-art performance achieved on PlantNet300k despite incomplete optimization, indicating room for further improvement.

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

### [6] [S$^3$IT: A Benchmark for Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19992)
*Zhe Sun,Xueyuan Yang,Yujie Lu,Zhenliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating embodied social intelligence in agents by testing seat-ordering tasks in 3D environments with LLM-driven NPCs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations fail to assess agents' ability to integrate social and physical constraints in realistic, embodied contexts, lacking scenarios that combine both aspects.

Method: Procedurally generated framework for diverse scenarios with controllable difficulty, involving active dialogue for preference acquisition, autonomous environment exploration, and multi-objective optimization under social and spatial constraints.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs struggle on S³IT, showing gaps in spatial intelligence but near human-level ability in resolving explicit textual conflict cues.

Conclusion: Embodied social intelligence remains a significant challenge for LLMs, highlighting the need for improved spatial and integrated reasoning capabilities though promising progress in social conflicts.

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

### [7] [Discovering Lie Groups with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20043)
*Jung Yeon Park,Yuxuan Chen,Floor Eijkelboom,Jan-Willem van de Meent,Lawson L. S. Wong,Robin Walters*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LieFlow is a method that learns symmetries from data via flow matching on Lie groups, enabling flexible discovery of discrete and continuous groups with less assumptions, demonstrated on 2D and 3D point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetry is crucial in physics and machine learning, but existing methods for discovering symmetries from data are limited in flexibility and require strong assumptions, prompting a need for a more general approach.

Method: Formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a hypothesis group using flow matching on Lie groups. Introduce a novel interpolation scheme to address 'last-minute convergence' issues where samples remain stationary. Tested on 2D and 3D point clouds with discrete groups like reflections.

Result: Successfully discovers discrete groups, including reflections, via flow matching over the complex domain. The method shows improved flexibility and reduced assumptions compared to previous works, though challenges like 'last-minute convergence' are noted and mitigated.

Conclusion: LieFlow provides an effective framework for learning symmetries from data, advancing symmetry discovery in machine learning and physics with practical benefits in sample efficiency and performance, supported by experimentation and novel techniques to overcome identified challenges.

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

### [8] [LongVideoAgent: Multi-Agent Reasoning with Long Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20618)
*Runtao Liu,Ziyi Liu,Jiaqi Tang,Yue Ma,Renjie Pi,Jipeng Zhang,Qifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework using a master LLM to coordinate grounding and vision agents for long-video QA, trained with RL to improve efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-video QA compress content into lossy summaries or use limited toolsets, which weakens temporal grounding and misses fine-grained visual cues.

Method: A master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize relevant segments and a vision agent to extract textual observations, with RL training to encourage concise and efficient multi-agent cooperation.

Result: The system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines on LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ datasets, with RL further strengthening reasoning and planning.

Conclusion: The multi-agent framework effectively improves temporal grounding and visual detail extraction for long-video QA, yielding interpretable trajectories and superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.

### [9] [Learning Skills from Action-Free Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20052)
*Hung-Chieh Fang,Kuo-Han Hung,Chu-Rong Chen,Po-Jung Chou,Chun-Kai Yang,Po-Chen Ko,Yu-Chiang Wang,Yueh-Hua Wu,Min-Hung Chen,Shao-Hua Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SOF learns latent skills from action-free videos using optical flow as an intermediate representation, enabling better video-to-action translation and high-level planning for robot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between video generative models (good visual predictions but hard to translate to actions) and latent-action models (better action alignment but limited to single-step planning), by leveraging large collections of action-free videos for robot skill learning.

Method: SOF framework learns latent skills through optical flow representations that capture motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions, creating a flow-based latent skill space for planning.

Result: Experiments show consistent performance improvements in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating effective skill acquisition and composition directly from raw visual data.

Conclusion: SOF successfully bridges video understanding and robot action learning by using optical flow as a motion-aligned intermediate representation, enabling effective skill learning from action-free videos for improved robot planning and task execution.

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

*Hao Li,Fabian Deuser,Wenping Yin,Steffen Knoblauch,Wufan Zhao,Filip Biljecki,Yong Xue,Wei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProbGLC is a probabilistic cross-view geolocalization approach that combines probabilistic and deterministic models to enhance disaster location identification with uncertainty quantification and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of disasters like heat waves, wildfires, and floods, rapid and accurate disaster location identification is crucial for effective response, resource allocation, and climate resilience.

Method: Proposes ProbGLC - a unified framework combining probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models to provide uncertainty quantification, probabilistic distributions, and localizability scores for cross-view disaster location identification.

Result: Achieves superior geolocalization accuracy (0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) on MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster datasets, with enhanced explainability through probabilistic distributions and localizability scores.

Conclusion: ProbGLC demonstrates great potential for improving disaster response through generative cross-view approaches that provide accurate location awareness with model explainability, enabling better and faster disaster management.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL-based training for content moderation achieves expert-level accuracy with high data efficiency (up to 100x better than supervised fine-tuning) and shows sigmoid-like scaling behavior with performance saturating after sufficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Content moderation at scale faces challenges with label sparsity, evolving policies, and need for nuanced reasoning beyond pattern matching, while existing LLM approaches lack practical training strategies for real-world settings.

Method: Comprehensive empirical investigation using reinforcement learning with multiple training recipes and reward-shaping strategies (verifiable rewards, LLM-as-judge) to transform general-purpose language models into policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks.

Result: RL shows sigmoid-like scaling behavior, improves performance on complex policy-grounded reasoning tasks, and achieves up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, especially effective when expert annotations are scarce.

Conclusion: RL training provides actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, offering substantial improvements in accuracy and efficiency for policy-aligned content classification in real-world settings.

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

### [12] [Reason2Decide: Rationale-Driven Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20074)
*H M Quamran Hasan,Housam Khalifa Bashier,Jiayi Dai,Mi-Young Kim,Randy Goebel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reason2Decide is a two-stage training framework that improves clinical decision support by addressing exposure bias and task separation, achieving better prediction accuracy and explanation alignment than other methods while using much smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision support systems need both high predictive accuracy and explanations that align with predictions, but current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations.

Method: Two-stage training framework: Stage-1 trains on rationale generation, Stage-2 jointly trains label prediction and rationale generation using scheduled sampling to transition from gold labels to model predictions.

Result: Outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs across three medical datasets in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity metrics. Works with models 40x smaller than foundation models.

Conclusion: LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining, reducing human annotation needs, and the approach makes clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while providing explainable decision support.

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

### [13] [Adaptive Financial Sentiment Analysis for NIFTY 50 via Instruction-Tuned LLMs , RAG and Reinforcement Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20082)
*Chaithra,Kamesh Kadimisetty,Biju R Mohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive framework combining LLMs with market feedback and reinforcement learning to improve financial sentiment analysis, showing significant performance gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the fact that existing financial sentiment analysis approaches have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. There's a need for adaptive frameworks that can integrate real-world market dynamics to improve sentiment classification accuracy and market alignment.

Method: The methodology involves fine-tuning LLaMA 3.2 3B model with instruction-based learning on SentiFin dataset. It employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline for multi-source contextual information and incorporates a feedback-driven module that adjusts source reliability by comparing predicted sentiment with actual stock returns. The system also includes a reinforcement learning agent using proximal policy optimization (PPO) to optimize source weighting policies across temporal data.

Result: Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines from 2024-2025 show significant improvements in classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods.

Conclusion: The study concludes that combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback mechanisms and reinforcement learning creates a robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling system that outperforms traditional approaches.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MolAct is an agentic reinforcement learning framework that treats molecular design as a multi-step process where an LLM agent learns to reason, use tools, and optimize molecules through iterated edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular editing and optimization are complex, iterative tasks requiring chemical validity and structural similarity preservation, but existing methods lack formalization as agentic reinforcement learning problems.

Method: Introduces a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability (MolEditAgent), then optimizing properties while reusing learned editing behaviors (MolOptAgent). Agents interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control.

Result: MolEditAgent-7B achieves nearly perfect valid edits (100, 95, 98 for add/delete/substitute), outperforming closed baselines like DeepSeek-R1; MolOptAgent-7B surpasses Claude 3.7 on LogP and remains competitive on solubility while balancing other objectives.

Conclusion: Treating molecular design as a tool-augmented, multi-step process enables reliable and interpretable improvements, with MolAct demonstrating strong performance in both editing and optimization tasks.

Abstract: Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.

*Xingyou Yin,Ceyao Zhang,Min Hu,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Injecting noise into raw time series data before tokenization improves frozen LLM performance for zero-shot forecasting by forcing models to focus on robust temporal patterns rather than numerical artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging truly off-the-shelf LLMs without fine-tuning for time series forecasting is challenging due to sensitivity to textual representations, as model parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts.

Method: A simple strategy of injecting noise into raw time series before tokenization, acting as inference-time augmentation to compel frozen LLMs to focus on robust underlying temporal patterns.

Result: Empirical validation across diverse benchmarks shows improved performance, with consistent gains on novel datasets specifically created to avoid LLM pre-training contamination bias.

Conclusion: Noise injection provides an effective non-invasive approach to improve frozen LLM performance for time series forecasting, advancing the use of off-the-shelf models without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

TL;DR: Developed a BiGRU model for predicting Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) in data centers to improve energy efficiency, achieving better performance than standard GRU using feature selection and hyperparameter optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data centers consume significant global energy and have large carbon footprints. Rising demands for edge computing and AI require improved energy efficiency to reduce costs, enhance competitiveness, and support environmental sustainability.

Method: Used BiGRU neural network architecture trained on 52,560 EnergyPlus simulation samples with 117 features. Applied RFECV for feature selection and hyperparameter optimization, comparing performance against standard GRU using MSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics.

Result: The optimized BiGRU model outperformed the standard GRU model in predicting PUE, demonstrating superior accuracy through the evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: BiGRU-based PUE prediction provides an effective method for understanding and optimizing data center energy efficiency, enabling targeted improvements to reduce environmental impact and operational costs.

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand fundamental differences in how humans and large language models infer and generalize mathematical concepts using inductive biases and inference strategies.

Method: Used a Bayesian model as an analytical framework to examine inductive biases and strategies of humans and LLMs in the number game task.

Result: Humans flexibly infer both rule-based and similarity-based concepts, generalize well from one example, while LLMs rely more on mathematical rules and require more samples.

Conclusion: There are fundamental differences in inference and generalization between humans and LLMs, with humans showing superior adaptability and few-shot learning capabilities.

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

*Ze Gong,Pradeep Varakantham,Akshat Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PreSa: A framework for offline preference-based RL that directly learns safe policies from human preferences and safety labels without explicitly modeling rewards/costs, outperforming constrained RL approaches in continuous control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safe RLHF methods learn reward/cost models then use constrained RL, but error accumulation in long-horizon tasks impairs performance. Need to directly learn safe policies from preferences.

Method: Propose PreSa framework that combines preference learning with safety alignment in constrained optimization via Lagrangian paradigm, directly learning reward-maximizing safe policies without explicit reward/cost models.

Result: Successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and offline safe RL approaches even with ground-truth reward/cost.

Conclusion: Direct policy learning from preferences and safety labels avoids error accumulation issues and achieves better safety-performance tradeoff than model-based constrained RL approaches.

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Conclusion: TongSIM is introduced as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence, offering flexibility, scalability, and broad applicability across diverse research needs.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.

*Xingbo Du,Loka Li,Duzhen Zhang,Le Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemR^3 is an autonomous agent system for memory retrieval in LLMs, enhancing answer quality through a router and evidence-gap tracker.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most memory systems in LLM agents focus on compression and storage, lacking explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval, which limits optimization.

Method: MemR^3 uses two core mechanisms: a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions, and a global evidence-gap tracker for transparent evidence collection.

Result: On the LoCoMo benchmark, MemR^3 surpasses baselines, improving existing retrievers with overall gains of +7.29% on RAG and +1.94% on Zep using GPT-4.1-mini.

Conclusion: MemR^3 offers a plug-and-play controller for memory systems, enabling autonomous decision-making and improving retrieval performance in LLM agents.

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: G-SPEC is a neuro-symbolic framework combining LLM agents with deterministic verification to ensure safe network automation in 5G/6G networks, achieving zero safety violations and 94.1% remediation success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Networks are evolving to 5G/6G with orchestration challenges beyond static automation and DRL capabilities, while LLM agents introduce stochastic risks like topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance.

Method: Proposed G-SPEC framework with Governance Triad: telecom-adapted LLM agent (TSLAM-4B), Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints to constrain probabilistic planning with deterministic verification.

Result: Achieved zero safety violations and 94.1% remediation success rate on 450-node 5G Core simulation, outperforming 82.4% baseline. NKG validation contributed 68% of safety gains, SHACL policies 24%. Scalable to 100K nodes with O(k^1.2) validation latency.

Conclusion: G-SPEC provides viable SMO-layer operations with minimal overhead (142ms), effectively mitigating LLM risks in network automation through neuro-symbolic governance.

Abstract: As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ActionFlow is a system-level inference framework that uses cross-request pipelining to significantly reduce VLA model latency, achieving 2.55x FPS improvement on edge devices without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to autoregressive decoding memory bottlenecks, which is insufficient for real-time robotic control requiring 20-30 Hz.

Method: Introduces Cross-Request Pipelining scheduler that batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across time steps, plus Cross-Request State Packed Forward operator and Unified KV Ring Buffer for memory optimization.

Result: Achieves 2.55x FPS improvement on OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dynamic manipulation on edge hardware.

Conclusion: ActionFlow effectively bridges the performance gap for VLA models on edge platforms, making real-time robotic interaction feasible without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to transition Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects by synthesizing executable code as procedural memory from a blank slate, as current mechanisms for this are underexplored.

Method: The method involves a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task with Outlook and OneDrive, addressing four structural bottlenecks: the Discovery Gap, Verification Gap, Decomposition Gap via Linear State Anchoring, and Scaling Gap, enforced by a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code.

Result: The result demonstrates that agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills by addressing these bottlenecks, improving skill generation efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that enforcing a scientific methodology enables LLMs to transition into active architects, effectively synthesizing executable procedural memory and overcoming key bottlenecks in automated skill generation for complex tasks.

Abstract: While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects. Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.

*Junren Li,Luhua Lai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SynCraft is an AI framework that uses large language models to optimize molecular synthesizability through precise structural edits instead of sequence translation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the bottleneck in generative AI where many generated molecules are synthetically inaccessible without compromising novelty or key pharmacophores.

Method: Reframes synthesizability optimization as a structural editing problem using reasoning-based approach, predicting atom-level edit sequences rather than generating SMILES directly.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity and demonstrates expert-level intuition in editing inhibitors and rescuing candidates.

Conclusion: SynCraft effectively leverages LLMs' reasoning capabilities to navigate the synthesis cliff and improve synthetic feasibility while maintaining structural integrity.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has revolutionized the exploration of chemical space, yet a critical bottleneck remains that a substantial fraction of generated molecules is synthetically inaccessible. Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the "synthesis cliff" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

TL;DR: Comparing LLMs and SLMs for shock prediction in ICU patients using MIMIC III data, showing comparable performance and highlighting the need for LLMs to focus on clinical trajectory prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have transformed NLP tasks, but their application in predictive clinical tasks is underexplored. Timely shock prediction can improve patient outcomes through early intervention, motivating a comparison with SLMs.

Method: Used text data from 17,294 ICU stays in MIMIC III, scoring for length of stay >24h and shock index >0.7 to identify 355 normal and 87 abnormal SI-index patients. Compared LLMs (GatorTron-Base, Llama 8B, Mistral 7B) with SLMs (BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec), finetuning with focal and cross-entropy losses to address class imbalance.

Result: GatorTron-Base achieved highest weighted recall of 80.5%, but overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs, indicating LLMs are not inherently superior in predicting clinical events.

Conclusion: LLMs are not superior to SLMs for clinical prediction despite strong text-based task performance. Future LLM training should prioritize predicting clinical trajectories over simpler NLP tasks to achieve meaningful outcomes.

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses the gap in teacher emotional analysis by creating a comprehensive multimodal dataset and developing an effective model that captures the complex interplay between teaching performance and instructional context.

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought reasoning improves AI-based stereotactic radiosurgery planning by enhancing transparency and dosimetric outcomes compared to non-reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of AI for precise stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is limited due to opacity of black-box systems; chain-of-thought reasoning could improve planning transparency and quality.

Method: Developed SAGE, an LLM-based planning agent, and tested two variants (reasoning vs. non-reasoning) on a retrospective cohort of 41 brain metastasis patients.

Result: Reasoning model achieved comparable dosimetry to human planners on primary endpoints (p > 0.21) with lower cochlear dose (p = 0.022), while exhibiting systematic planning behaviors like constraint verification.

Conclusion: Chain-of-thought reasoning enables more transparent and auditable automated SRS planning, potentially increasing clinical trust and adoption.

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

Abstract: The rapid growth of cloud computing in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry has created a critical need for resource and job lifetime prediction to achieve optimal scheduling. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle with the complexity and heterogeneity of EDA workloads, requiring extensive feature engineering and domain expertise.

*Taoran Sheng,Manfred Huber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comprehensive study of wearable sensor-based human activity recognition across supervision spectrum, showing weak supervision methods can match fully supervised performance with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to balance performance and labeling requirements in human activity recognition - supervised methods need extensive labels while unsupervised methods have suboptimal performance.

Method: Compared 6 approaches: fully supervised, basic unsupervised, weakly supervised with constraints, multi-task learning, self-supervised with domain expertise, and novel weakly self-supervised framework.

Result: Weakly supervised methods achieved comparable performance to fully supervised with significantly less labels; multi-task learning enhanced performance; weakly self-supervised worked well with only 10% labeled data.

Conclusion: Different learning paradigms have complementary strengths; novel weakly self-supervised framework is promising for practical HAR applications with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors has advanced through various machine learning paradigms, each with inherent trade-offs between performance and labeling requirements. While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited.

TL;DR: A multimodal deep learning model integrating structured and unstructured clinical data from the first 24 hours of ICU admission predicts in-hospital mortality risk with improved accuracy after external validation across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients can optimize treatment, prompting the development of a model using diverse data sources for accurate risk assessment.

Method: Used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID databases spanning 2001-2022, with inputs including time-invariant and time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. Developed and externally validated a multimodal model on temporally separated populations.

Result: The model achieved AUROC of 0.92, AUPRC of 0.53, and Brier score of 0.19 with structured data; inclusion of notes and imaging improved AUROC from 0.87 to 0.89, AUPRC from 0.43 to 0.48, and reduced Brier score from 0.37 to 0.17. External validation on eICU showed AUROCs of 0.84-0.92.

Conclusion: Incorporating multiple data sources enhances mortality prediction accuracy, and external validation demonstrates model generalizability, underscoring the importance of using diverse clinical information for patient risk assessment.

Abstract: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients can aid clinicians in optimizing treatment. The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating multiple sources of patient information for mortality prediction and the importance of external validation.

TL;DR: An end-to-end reinforcement learning framework using graph attention networks to automatically design efficient transit networks, achieving significant improvements over manual planning and traditional heuristics on real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transit network design is an NP-hard problem with exponentially large solution spaces that traditionally requires manual planning, which is inefficient and suboptimal.

Method: Uses graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction with a two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback and simulation-based terminal rewards.

Result: Substantially outperforms existing designs and heuristics - achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to real-world networks, and 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics.

Conclusion: End-to-end reinforcement learning can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.

Abstract: Designing efficient transit route networks is an NP-hard problem with exponentially large solution spaces that traditionally relies on manual planning processes. We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction. To address the long-horizon credit assignment challenge, we introduce a two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback with simulation-based terminal rewards. We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction. These results demonstrate that end-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.

TL;DR: ICFA is a practical framework for efficient search in large candidate spaces using target-conditioned reweighting, adaptive focusing control, and diagnostic tools, validated through language generation and navigation experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a recurring practical challenge in finding rare but useful solutions in very large candidate spaces across domains like language generation, planning, and reinforcement learning. Existing methods often struggle with efficiency and sample requirements in such settings.

Method: The Inverted Causality Focusing Algorithm (ICFA) treats search as target-conditioned reweighting, reusing a proposal sampler and task-specific similarity function to form a focused sampling distribution. It includes adaptive control of focusing strength to avoid degeneracy, a stability diagnostic based on effective sample size, and theoretical analysis.

Result: ICFA provides a clear recipe for implementation and demonstrates effectiveness through reproducible experiments in constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation. The framework is shown to reduce sample needs in certain conditions and a hybrid architecture combining prompted inference with algorithmic reweighting is described.

Conclusion: The proposed ICFA framework, combined with adaptive control and diagnostic tools, offers a practical solution for efficient search in large candidate spaces. The hybrid architecture integrating prompted inference with algorithmic reweighting further enhances its applicability.

Abstract: Finding rare but useful solutions in very large candidate spaces is a recurring practical challenge across language generation, planning, and reinforcement learning. We present a practical framework, \emph{Inverted Causality Focusing Algorithm} (ICFA), that treats search as a target-conditioned reweighting process. ICFA reuses an available proposal sampler and a task-specific similarity function to form a focused sampling distribution, while adaptively controlling focusing strength to avoid degeneracy. We provide a clear recipe, a stability diagnostic based on effective sample size, a compact theoretical sketch explaining when ICFA can reduce sample needs, and two reproducible experiments: constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation. We further show how structured prompts instantiate an approximate, language-level form of ICFA and describe a hybrid architecture combining prompted inference with algorithmic reweighting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic data evaluation is fragmented with heterogeneous metrics, ad-hoc scripts, and incomplete reporting practices, creating a gap in standardized assessment.

Method: SDB provides automated feature-type detection, distributional and dependency-level fidelity metrics, graph- and embedding-based structure preservation scores, and visualization schemas.

Result: SDB demonstrated robustness across three diverse real-world use cases (healthcare, socioeconomic/financial modeling, cybersecurity) with varying data complexity, showing consistent and reproducible benchmarking capabilities.

Conclusion: SDB offers a comprehensive, domain-agnostic solution for synthetic data fidelity assessment that addresses diverse data types and analytical requirements while ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), synthetic data are widely used to accelerate innovation while preserving privacy and enabling broader data accessibility. However, the evaluation of synthetic data remains fragmented across heterogeneous metrics, ad-hoc scripts, and incomplete reporting practices. To address this gap, we introduce Synthetic Data Blueprint (SDB), a modular Pythonic based library to quantitatively and visually assess the fidelity of synthetic tabular data. SDB supports: (i) automated feature-type detection, (ii) distributional and dependency-level fidelity metrics, (iii) graph- and embedding-based structure preservation scores, and (iv) a rich suite of data visualization schemas. To demonstrate the breadth, robustness, and domain-agnostic applicability of the SDB, we evaluated the framework across three real-world use cases that differ substantially in scale, feature composition, statistical complexity, and downstream analytical requirements. These include: (i) healthcare diagnostics, (ii) socioeconomic and financial modelling, and (iii) cybersecurity and network traffic analysis. These use cases reveal how SDB can address diverse data fidelity assessment challenges, varying from mixed-type clinical variables to high-cardinality categorical attributes and high-dimensional telemetry signals, while at the same time offering a consistent, transparent, and reproducible benchmarking across heterogeneous domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current modeling techniques for battery degradation sequences are inefficient and inadequate for real-life applications due to poor handling of local and global correlations.

Method: Proposed MDFA-Net with dual paths: MF-Net maintains shallow information, and EC-Net captures deep trends, enabling effective integration of local and global patterns.

Result: Testing on two Li-ion battery datasets shows MDFA-Net outperforms top-tier methods in RUL prediction, accurately mapping capacity degradation trajectories.

Conclusion: The novel architecture enhances the reliability and safety of targeted maintenance strategies by addressing inefficiencies in existing battery degradation modeling.

Abstract: Targeted maintenance strategies, ensuring the dependability and safety of industrial machinery. However, current modeling techniques for assessing both local and global correlation of battery degradation sequences are inefficient and difficult to meet the needs in real-life applications. For this reason, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, multiscale dual-path feature aggregation network (MDFA-Net), for RUL prediction. MDFA-Net consists of dual-path networks, the first path network, multiscale feature network (MF-Net) that maintains the shallow information and avoids missing information, and the second path network is an encoder network (EC-Net) that captures the continuous trend of the sequences and retains deep details. Integrating both deep and shallow attributes effectively grasps both local and global patterns. Testing conducted with two publicly available Lithium-ion battery datasets reveals our approach surpasses existing top-tier methods in RUL forecasting, accurately mapping the capacity degradation trajectory.

*Stefan Kuyumdzhiev,Radostin Cholakov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 1-bit delta compression method for fine-tuned LLMs that reduces checkpoint size and cold-start latency by storing weight differences as signs and per-axis scaling factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serve many task-specialized LLM variants efficiently despite large fine-tuned checkpoint sizes and high cold-start latency, leveraging that fine-tuned weights differ from the base model by small structured residuals.

Method: Propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme representing weight differences: store only the sign bits of the delta along with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors learned from a small calibration set.

Result: The design improves reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives, reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead via streamlined loader for packed deltas, and yields artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint while maintaining inference efficiency.

Conclusion: The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, avoids dense reconstruction for efficient inference, with experimental setup and source code provided.

Abstract: Serving many task-specialized LLM variants is often limited by the large size of fine-tuned checkpoints and the resulting cold-start latency. Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint. The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, and maintains inference efficiency by avoiding dense reconstruction.

*Vineet Yadav*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sign-aware multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework that extends overlap-based distances to handle real- and complex-valued signals while maintaining metric and positive-semidefinite kernel properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified similarity framework that can handle signed signals (real and complex values) while preserving bounded metric structure and kernel properties, overcoming limitations of traditional overlap-based methods.

Method: Represent signals as atomic measures on signed state space, embed them into nonnegative multistate representations using positive/negative splits and various decompositions, then apply Tanimoto construction to get bounded distances and positive-semidefinite kernels.

Result: Developed a family of [0,1] distances satisfying triangle inequality, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and exact budget accounting across signal coalitions via Möbius inversion.

Conclusion: The framework provides a single, interpretable distance that simultaneously offers metric structure, kernel methods compatibility, probabilistic interpretation, and transparent budget analysis for scientific and financial applications.

Abstract: We introduce a sign-aware, multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework that extends overlap-based distances from nonnegative vectors and measures to arbitrary real- and complex-valued signals while retaining bounded metric and positive-semidefinite kernel structure. Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method that adjusts forecasts using node-specific cost asymmetry to minimize expenses, achieving $5.1M in annual savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasts often ignore real-world cost asymmetries (e.g., under-predicting a critical resource may be more costly than over-predicting), leading to inefficient decisions and higher operational costs.

Method: Dynamically incorporate cost asymmetry into the forecasting error probability distribution to favor scenarios with lower costs. Include a self-regulation mechanism that adjusts adaptation based on observed savings to handle local conditions and unmodeled factors like calibration errors or macroeconomic shifts.

Result: The model successfully generates significant cost reductions, with empirical results showing an ability to achieve annual savings of $5.1 million.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances forecast accuracy and reduces costs by integrating cost asymmetry, offering a practical and adaptive solution suitable for varying station-specific conditions.

Abstract: This work introduces a methodology to adjust forecasts based on node-specific cost function asymmetry. The proposed model generates savings by dynamically incorporating the cost asymmetry into the forecasting error probability distribution to favor the least expensive scenario. Savings are calculated and a self-regulation mechanism modulates the adjustments magnitude based on the observed savings, enabling the model to adapt to station-specific conditions and unmodeled factors such as calibration errors or shifting macroeconomic dynamics. Finally, empirical results demonstrate the model's ability to achieve \$5.1M annual savings.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework that efficiently integrates data quality assessment with machine learning (ML) model operations in real-time production environments. While existing approaches treat data quality assessment and ML systems as isolated processes, our framework addresses the critical gap between theoretical methods and practical implementation by combining dynamic drift detection, adaptive data quality metrics, and MLOps into a cohesive, lightweight system. The key innovation lies in its operational efficiency, enabling real-time, quality-driven ML decision-making with minimal computational overhead. We validate the framework in a steel manufacturing company's Electroslag Remelting (ESR) vacuum pumping process, demonstrating a 12% improvement in model performance (R2 = 94%) and a fourfold reduction in prediction latency. By exploring the impact of data quality acceptability thresholds, we provide actionable insights into balancing data quality standards and predictive performance in industrial applications. This framework represents a significant advancement in MLOps, offering a robust solution for time-sensitive, data-driven decision-making in dynamic industrial environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of fixed machine learning models in dynamic real-world applications and emphasizes the need for Continual Learning (CL) and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to build adaptive AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often fail in changing environments because they rely on an i.i.d. assumption, making them incapable of handling new data or conditions post-deployment without costly retraining.

Method: Proposes integrating Continual Learning to learn incrementally from evolving data streams while avoiding forgetting, and Out-of-Distribution detection to identify novel inputs that deviate from training data.

Result: A framework linking CL and OOD detection to enhance model reliability and adaptability, addressing limitations like computational expense and practicality in resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: Jointly addressing CL and OOD detection is essential for developing robust and efficient AI systems that can adapt to real-world variability and operational demands over time.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of machine learning models across a wide range of fields, fueled by increased computational resources, large-scale datasets, and the rise of deep learning architectures. From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Split-policy architecture using on-device GPU shaders to compress observations for remote RL inference, reducing latency and bandwidth usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying visual RL policies on edge devices is challenging due to computational constraints and communication latency when offloading to remote servers.

Method: Uses small on-device encoder implemented as OpenGL fragment-shader passes to transform observations into compact feature tensors for transmission to remote policy head.

Result: Reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency in bandwidth-limited settings, decreases server compute, while achieving comparable learning performance with modest return trade-offs.

Conclusion: The split-policy approach enables efficient RL deployment on resource-constrained edge devices with broad embedded GPU support.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved strong results, but deploying visual policies on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to computational cost and communication latency. Many deployments therefore offload policy inference to a remote server, incurring network round trips and requiring transmission of high-dimensional observations. We introduce a split-policy architecture in which a small on-device encoder, implemented as OpenGL fragment-shader passes for broad embedded GPU support, transforms each observation into a compact feature tensor that is transmitted to a remote policy head. In RL, this communication overhead manifests as closed-loop decision latency rather than only per-request inference latency. The proposed approach reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency in bandwidth-limited settings, and reduces server-side compute per request, whilst achieving broadly comparable learning performance by final return (mean over the final 100 episodes) in single-run benchmarks, with modest trade-offs in mean return. We evaluate across an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a Raspberry Pi 4B, and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, reporting learning results, on-device execution behaviour under sustained load, and end-to-end decision latency and scalability measurements under bandwidth shaping. Code for training, deployment, and measurement is released as open source.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combines LSTM neural networks with augmented Moore's law to forecast spacecraft lifetimes, addressing right-censoring bias using STETI method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in forecasting technological advancement in space exploration by overcoming limitations of traditional quantitative trend extrapolation methods and dealing with right-censoring bias in spacecraft lifetime data.

Method: Developed a hybrid model combining LSTM neural networks with augmented Moore's law, using the STETI (Start Time End Time Integration) approach to mitigate right-censoring bias in lifetime analysis.

Result: Created a forecasting model that provides more accurate spacecraft lifetime predictions by addressing systematic distortion in lifetime vs. launch date curves.

Conclusion: The STETI-enhanced hybrid model offers improved forecasting capabilities for spacecraft lifetimes, providing valuable insights for space mission planning and policy decisions.

Abstract: Forecasting technological advancement in complex domains such as space exploration presents significant challenges due to the intricate interaction of technical, economic, and policy-related factors. The field of technology forecasting has long relied on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques, such as growth curves (e.g., Moore's law) and time series models, to project technological progress. To assess the current state of these methods, we conducted an updated systematic literature review (SLR) that incorporates recent advances. This review highlights a growing trend toward machine learning-based hybrid models.
  Motivated by this review, we developed a forecasting model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes. Operational lifetime is an important engineering characteristic of spacecraft and a potential proxy for technological progress in space exploration. Lifetimes were modeled as depending on launch date and additional predictors.
  Our modeling analysis introduces a novel advance in the recently introduced Start Time End Time Integration (STETI) approach. STETI addresses a critical right censoring problem known to bias lifetime analyses: the more recent the launch dates, the shorter the lifetimes of the spacecraft that have failed and can thus contribute lifetime data. Longer-lived spacecraft are still operating and therefore do not contribute data. This systematically distorts putative lifetime versus launch date curves by biasing lifetime estimates for recent launch dates downward. STETI mitigates this distortion by interconverting between expressing lifetimes as functions of launch time and modeling them as functions of failure time. The results provide insights relevant to space mission planning and policy decision-making.

*Haocheng Lu,Minjun Zhu,Henry Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight post-training pipeline using a MathVerifier to detect structured errors in LLM mathematical reasoning and guide weighted DPO for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with mathematical reasoning, and existing methods treat solutions as binary, ignoring structured errors like logical flaws, while RLHF variants are expensive and unstable.

Method: Start with SFT on CoT data, introduce a compact MathVerifier to decompose solutions into a six-dimensional error profile with wrongness and absurdity scores, and use these to mine hard negatives and weight preference pairs for offline weighted DPO.

Result: On a 1.5B-parameter model, verifier-guided weighted DPO improves over vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, especially on near-correct but logically inconsistent problems, without heavy overhead.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively targets structured errors in LLM mathematical reasoning under compute budgets, offering a practical alternative to costly RLHF methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with mathematical reasoning, and common post-training pipelines often reduce each generated solution to a binary outcome: correct or incorrect. This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges.

TL;DR: FlowFM is a foundation model combining representation encoder and conditional flow matching generator for efficient generation and recognition on wearable sensor data, outperforming SSL methods with speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are powerful for self-supervised learning but suffer from trade-offs between generative quality and discriminative performance, with high computational costs limiting industrial and edge AI applications.

Method: FlowFM jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator, decoupling design for quality and recognition, and uses flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field for faster, stabilized training.

Result: Experiments show FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4% compared to diffusion, surpasses SSL-Wearables on five datasets with up to 51.0x inference speedup while maintaining high generative quality.

Conclusion: FlowFM effectively addresses diffusion model inefficiencies, enabling scalable, high-performance self-supervised learning with superior speed and quality for practical AI applications, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion models can learn rich representations during data generation, showing potential for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), but they face a trade-off between generative quality and discriminative performance. Their iterative sampling also incurs substantial computational and energy costs, hindering industrial and edge AI applications. To address these issues, we propose the Flow Matching-based Foundation Model (FlowFM), which jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator. This decoupled design achieves both high-fidelity generation and effective recognition. By using flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field, FlowFM accelerates and stabilizes training, improving its efficiency for representation learning. Experiments on wearable sensor data show FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4\% compared to a diffusion-based approach. On downstream tasks, FlowFM surpassed the state-of-the-art SSL method (SSL-Wearables) on all five datasets while achieving up to a 51.0x inference speedup and maintaining high generative quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ArcGen is a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method that uses architecture-invariant features to detect backdoors in deep learning models, achieving up to 42.5% improvement in detection performance on unseen architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods don't generalize well to new model architectures not seen during training, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: Proposes ArcGen which introduces an alignment layer in feature extraction to reduce architecture influence, and uses two alignment losses (distribution and sample level) to ensure features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned.

Result: Achieves up to 42.5% improvement in detection performance (AUC) on unseen model architectures, validated on 16,896 models across diverse datasets, backdoor attacks, and architectures.

Conclusion: ArcGen effectively addresses the generalization problem in backdoor detection by learning architecture-invariant features, making it more practical for real-world deployment across different model architectures.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures.

Abstract: Thanks to the evolving network depth, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various embedded scenarios, paving the way for ubiquitous embedded intelligence. Despite its promise, the evolving network depth comes at the cost of degraded hardware efficiency.

Motivation: To systematically analyze the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset by removing descriptors that encode band-structure information like effective masses, thereby providing a curated dataset for leakage-aware prediction studies.

Method: Perform systematic analysis to identify and remove leakage-causing descriptors, curate a subset of 2280 materials, implement a three-phase modeling framework incorporating basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes using tree-based models.

Result: Tree-based models achieve R2 values of approximately 0.88 to 0.90 across all phases; SHAP analysis consistently identifies dielectric tensor components as the dominant contributors, indicating no substantial improvement with expanded descriptor space when leakage is controlled.

Conclusion: This work provides a curated, leakage-controlled dataset and baseline performance metrics, highlighting the importance of controlling data leakage and the dominance of dielectric tensor components in predictive accuracy for future bandgap prediction studies.

Abstract: In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset and identify and remove descriptors that may inadvertently encode band-structure information, such as effective masses.

The results show that tree-based models achieve R2 values of approximately 0.88 to 0.90 across all phases, indicating that expanding the descriptor space does not substantially improve predictive accuracy when leakage is controlled.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a simpler and more effective alternative to sparse autoencoders for extracting interpretable concepts from neural networks, addressing the need for unsupervised concept discovery methods.

Method: Clustering differences in neural activations, justified through discriminant analysis, with refinement using skewness-based weighting to enhance concept diversity.

Result: Achieves superior concept quality compared to prior unsupervised sparse autoencoder variants and approaches supervised baselines; extracted concepts enable causal steering of model behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed activation difference clustering method provides an effective unsupervised approach for interpretable concept extraction that outperforms sparse autoencoders and demonstrates practical utility for model steering.

Abstract: We propose an alternative to sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as a simple and effective unsupervised method for extracting interpretable concepts from neural networks. The core idea is to cluster differences in activations, which we formally justify within a discriminant analysis framework. To enhance the diversity of extracted concepts, we refine the approach by weighting the clustering using the skewness of activations. The method aligns with Deleuze's modern view of concepts as differences. We evaluate the approach across five models and three modalities (vision, language, and audio), measuring concept quality, diversity, and consistency. Our results show that the proposed method achieves concept quality surpassing prior unsupervised SAE variants while approaching supervised baselines, and that the extracted concepts enable steering of a model's inner representations, demonstrating their causal influence on downstream behavior.

TL;DR: CAP is a training-free prompting framework that uses case-based reasoning to reduce demographic bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for ICU mortality prediction but exhibit demographic biases (sex, age, race) that limit trustworthy clinical use, and existing debiasing methods often sacrifice predictive performance.

Method: Proposes CAse Prompting (CAP) - a training-free framework combining conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning, where the model learns from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes to correct biased reasoning patterns.

Result: On MIMIC-IV dataset: AUROC increased from 0.806 to 0.873, AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis shows highly consistent attention patterns (similarity scores >0.98) across demographic groups.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and CAP's carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

Abstract: Accurate mortality risk prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is essential for clinical decision-making. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoPHo is a classifier-guided method for conditional graph generation that uses persistent homology to steer diffusion models toward desired structural properties without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based graph generation methods either require retraining for each attribute (inefficient) or use classifier guidance that ignores topology scale and practical constraints.

Method: Incorporates gradients from pre-trained graph classifiers into discrete reverse diffusion, using persistent homology filtration on intermediate graphs to provide guidance signals at each denoising step.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on four network datasets for matching target metrics, and shows transferability on QM9 molecular dataset.

Conclusion: CoPHo enables effective conditional topology generation by leveraging persistent homology-based guidance, offering better performance than prior approaches.

Abstract: The structure of topology underpins much of the research on performance and robustness, yet available topology data are typically scarce, necessitating the generation of synthetic graphs with desired properties for testing or release. Prior diffusion-based approaches either embed conditions into the diffusion model, requiring retraining for each attribute and hindering real-time applicability, or use classifier-based guidance post-training, which does not account for topology scale and practical constraints. In this paper, we show from a discrete perspective that gradients from a pre-trained graph-level classifier can be incorporated into the discrete reverse diffusion posterior to steer generation toward specified structural properties. Based on this insight, we propose Classifier-guided Conditional Topology Generation with Persistent Homology (CoPHo), which builds a persistent homology filtration over intermediate graphs and interprets features as guidance signals that steer generation toward the desired properties at each denoising step. Experiments on four generic/network datasets demonstrate that CoPHo outperforms existing methods at matching target metrics, and we further validate its transferability on the QM9 molecular dataset.

Abstract: Reliable prediction of train delays is essential for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of railway transportation systems. In this work, we reframe delay forecasting as a stochastic simulation task, modeling state-transition dynamics through imitation learning. We introduce Drift-Corrected Imitation Learning (DCIL), a novel self-supervised algorithm that extends DAgger by incorporating distance-based drift correction, thereby mitigating covariate shift during rollouts without requiring access to an external oracle or adversarial schemes. Our approach synthesizes the dynamical fidelity of event-driven models with the representational capacity of data-driven methods, enabling uncertainty-aware forecasting via Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate DCIL using a comprehensive real-world dataset from \textsc{Infrabel}, the Belgian railway infrastructure manager, which encompasses over three million train movements. Our results, focused on predictions up to 30 minutes ahead, demonstrate superior predictive performance of DCIL over traditional regression models and behavioral cloning on deep learning architectures, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the sequential and uncertain nature of delay propagation in large-scale networks.

Motivation: Accurate package volume forecasting is critical for last-mile logistics to avoid inefficient resource allocation, higher costs, and delivery delays caused by forecasting errors.

Method: Combines supervised learning (LightGBM regression for station-level forecasts) with reinforcement learning (PPO agent for buffer control using discrete action sets) and generative AI (for interpretable summaries using SHAP feature attributions). Uses Monte Carlo updates for policy adaptation.

Result: Reduced Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) by 21.65% across 400+ stations compared to manual forecasts, while lowering under-buffering incidents and improving transparency for decision-makers.

Conclusion: OpComm demonstrates how contextual reinforcement learning combined with predictive modeling can effectively address operational forecasting challenges and bridge statistical rigor with practical decision-making in logistics environments.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of package volumes at delivery stations is critical for last-mile logistics, where errors lead to inefficient resource allocation, higher costs, and delivery delays. We propose OpComm, a forecasting and decision-support framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning-based buffer control and a generative AI-driven communication module. A LightGBM regression model generates station-level demand forecasts, which serve as context for a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that selects buffer levels from a discrete action set. The reward function penalizes under-buffering more heavily than over-buffering, reflecting real-world trade-offs between unmet demand risks and resource inefficiency. Station outcomes are fed back through a Monte Carlo update mechanism, enabling continual policy adaptation. To enhance interpretability, a generative AI layer produces executive-level summaries and scenario analyses grounded in SHAP-based feature attributions. Across 400+ stations, OpComm reduced Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) by 21.65% compared to manual forecasts, while lowering under-buffering incidents and improving transparency for decision-makers. This work shows how contextual reinforcement learning, coupled with predictive modeling, can address operational forecasting challenges and bridge statistical rigor with practical decision-making in high-stakes logistics environments.

### [55] [OASI: Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization for Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization in TinyML Keyword Spotting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19739)
*Soumen Garai,Suman Samui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OASI is a novel initialization strategy using Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing to generate diverse, high-performing configurations for Keyword Spotting models on TinyML devices, outperforming traditional initialization methods in hypervolume and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current initialization methods for Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization in ultra-low-power TinyML devices rely on naive sampling routines that aren't optimized for Pareto front discovery, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and model size.

Method: Proposed Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI) that uses Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing to generate a seed Pareto set explicitly balancing accuracy and model size constraints.

Result: OASI achieved the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and lowest generational distance (0.0) compared to LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, with only modest computational overhead (1934s vs ~1500s). Statistical analysis confirmed superior consistency.

Conclusion: OASI provides a statistically superior initialization strategy for MOBO in resource-constrained TinyML applications, offering better Pareto front discovery while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Voice assistants utilize Keyword Spotting (KWS) to enable efficient, privacy-friendly activation. However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $η^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $α=0.05$ threshold.

*Shoaib Mohammad,Guanqun Song,Ting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-stage optimization pipeline for compressing Vision Transformers that combines activation profiling, pruning, mixed-precision execution, and quantization to reduce memory usage by 76% and latency by 6x while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large transformer models on edge devices is challenging due to strict memory, compute, and latency constraints that need to be addressed for practical deployment.

Method: Uses activation profiling with forward hooks to identify low-importance channels, structured pruning of MLP layers, selective FP16 conversion, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to INT8 without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.

Result: On CIFAR-10, achieved 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency while retaining or improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 ViT-Huge model with 632M parameters.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical solution for efficient transformer inference on edge platforms and enables future integration of dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts architectures.

Abstract: Deploying large-scale transformer models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to strict constraints on memory, compute, and latency. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.

### [59] [Brain-Grounded Axes for Reading and Steering LLM States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19399)
*Sandro Andric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to ground large language model (LLM) interpretability using brain-derived coordinates from human brain activity patterns, enabling steered control without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability methods for LLMs rely on textual supervision, which lacks external grounding; using brain activity as a coordinate system offers a neurophysiology-based alternative for reading and steering LLM states.

Method: The approach constructs a word-level brain atlas from MEG data (SMN4Lang dataset) using phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extracts latent axes via ICA. Lightweight adapters map LLM hidden states to these brain axes, enabling steering without fine-tuning the LLM. It includes validation with lexica and NER-based labels, and comparisons with text-based probes.

Result: Brain-derived directions yield a robust lexical axis in a mid TinyLlama layer (linked to frequency), surviving perplexity controls, and a function/content axis consistent across models (TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, GPT-2). Axis stability is high (|r|=0.64-0.95) even with alternative embeddings. fMRI anchoring shows potential but is sensitive to modeling assumptions.

Conclusion: Neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior, supporting a novel interface that enhances interpretability and steering capabilities based on brain activity patterns.

Abstract: Interpretability methods for large language models (LLMs) typically derive directions from textual supervision, which can lack external grounding. We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CUDA-APML is a sparse GPU implementation of APML, a method for approximating Earth Mover Distance in 3D point cloud learning, offering near-linear memory scaling and reducing GPU memory by 99.9% compared to dense approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing loss functions like Chamfer Distance and Earth Mover Distance have trade-offs: Chamfer is efficient but allows many-to-one correspondences, Earth Mover is accurate but computationally expensive, and APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations but scales quadratically in memory, causing inefficiency.

Method: The method involves CUDA-APML, which implements sparse GPU techniques such as thresholding negligible assignments, adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization in COO form, with pairwise distance evaluation remaining quadratic in the current implementation.

Result: On ShapeNet and MM-Fi datasets, CUDA-APML matches the performance of dense APML within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory usage by 99.9%.

Conclusion: CUDA-APML effectively addresses the memory scaling issue of APML by leveraging sparse implementations, making it a practical solution for efficient and accurate 3D point cloud learning with significant memory savings.

Abstract: Loss functions are fundamental to learning accurate 3D point cloud models, yet common choices trade geometric fidelity for computational cost. Chamfer Distance is efficient but permits many-to-one correspondences, while Earth Mover Distance better reflects one-to-one transport at high computational cost. APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations and an analytically derived temperature, but its dense formulation scales quadratically in memory. We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation. On ShapeNet and MM-Fi, CUDA-APML matches dense APML within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9%. Code available at: https://github.com/Multimodal-Sensing-Lab/apml

### [62] [How Many Experts Are Enough? Towards Optimal Semantic Specialization for Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19765)
*Sumin Park,Noseong Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MASS is a semantic-aware MoE framework that adaptively expands experts and dynamically routes tokens based on semantic specialization needs, outperforming existing methods in both language and vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SMoE frameworks either require extensive hyperparameter tuning or fail to properly diversify semantic roles across experts when adjusting expert pool size, limiting their ability to capture full semantic diversity.

Method: Introduced gradient-based semantic drift detector for targeted expert expansion and adaptive routing strategy that dynamically adjusts expert usage based on token-level routing confidence mass.

Result: MASS reliably converges to optimal cost-performance balance with improved semantic specialization in synthetic setups, and consistently outperforms strong MoE baselines on real-world language and vision datasets.

Conclusion: MASS demonstrates domain robustness and enhanced expert specialization, effectively addressing the limitations of current SMoE frameworks through its semantic-aware adaptive expansion and routing mechanisms.

Abstract: Finding the optimal configuration of Sparse Mixture-ofExperts (SMoE) that maximizes semantic differentiation among experts is essential for exploiting the full potential of MoE architectures. However, existing SMoE frameworks either heavily rely on hyperparameter tuning or overlook the importance of diversifying semantic roles across experts when adapting the expert pool size. We propose Mixture-of-Experts for Adaptive Semantic Specialization (MASS), a semanticaware MoE framework for adaptive expert expansion and dynamic routing. MASS introduces two key advancements: (i) a gradient-based semantic drift detector that prompts targeted expert expansion when the existing expert pool lacks capacity to capture the full semantic diversity of the data, and (ii) an integration of adaptive routing strategy that dynamically adjusts expert usage based on token-level routing confidence mass. We first demonstrate that MASS reliably converges to the point of optimal balance between cost-performance trade-off with notably improved sematic specialization in a highly controlled synthetic setup. Further empirical results on real-world datasets across language and vision domains show that MASS consistently outperforms a range of strong MoE baselines, demonstrating its domain robustness and enhanced expert specialization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the importance of reproducibility in machine learning for scientific validity and debugging purposes, particularly focusing on clustering algorithms where bitwise identical results are essential.

Method: The authors decomposed K-Means, DBSCAN, and Ward clustering algorithms into their fundamental steps and identified conditions for repeatability at each stage. They used scikit-learn implementation in Python to examine repeatable aspects.

Result: The study revealed inconsistent results with K-Means when using more than two OpenMP threads, highlighting a specific implementation issue that affects reproducibility.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that reproducibility in machine learning is crucial for scientific integrity, and identifies specific conditions and issues affecting repeatability in popular clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Ward.

Abstract: Reproducibility is essential in machine learning because it ensures that a model or experiment yields the same scientific conclusion. For specific algorithms repeatability with bitwise identical results is also a key for scientific integrity because it allows debugging. We decomposed several very popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN and Ward into their fundamental steps, and we identify the conditions required to achieve repeatability at each stage. We use an implementation example with the Python library scikit-learn to examine the repeatable aspects of each method. Our results reveal inconsistent results with K-Means when the number of OpenMP threads exceeds two. This work aims to raise awareness of this issue among both users and developers, encouraging further investigation and potential fixes.

*Shane X. Coffing,John Tipton,Arvind T. Mohan,Darren Engwirda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces randPROM: a physics-informed reduced order model using neural Galerkin-Projections with statistical pooling for generating tsunami simulations with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create reduced order models (ROMs) that are not constrained to fixed weights and can generalize to similar problems while maintaining statistical interpretability and physical justification.

Method: Develops randPROM - a reduced order model using neural Galerkin-Projections encoded with PDE physics via neural networks, with statistical hierarchical pooling to learn distributions on initial values of temporal weights.

Result: Applied randPROM to synthetic tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster, demonstrating reduced simulation requirements for generating statistically calibrated tsunami predictions.

Conclusion: The randPROM method shows potential for enabling statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction models for tsunami wave arrival times and heights with significantly reduced computational expense.

Abstract: Reduced order models (ROM) can represent spatiotemporal processes in significantly fewer dimensions and can be solved many orders faster than their governing partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves.

*Deepit Sapru*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for marketing that uses uplift modeling and constrained optimization to target customers with offers while respecting business limits, improving revenue and retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marketers need to optimize targeting strategies for offers (e.g., retention messages, rewards) under constraints like budget or customer experience, moving beyond traditional methods like propensity scoring.

Method: Estimate Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) with uplift learners to predict treatment impact, then solve a constrained allocation problem to decide targeting and offer deployment limited by factors such as budget.

Result: Outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, IPS, and SNIPS. A/B test confirms lift in revenue and completion while maintaining constraints.

Conclusion: Provides a reusable playbook for marketers to implement causal targeting at scale, set guardrails, and align campaigns with key performance indicators.

Abstract: This paper introduces a marketing decision framework that converts heterogeneous-treatment uplift into constrained targeting strategies to maximize revenue and retention while honoring business guardrails. The approach estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) with uplift learners and then solves a constrained allocation to decide who to target and which offer to deploy under limits such as budget or acceptable sales deterioration. Applied to retention messaging, event rewards, and spend-threshold assignment, the framework consistently outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS). A production-scale online A/B test further validates strategic lift on revenue and completion while preserving customer-experience constraints. The result is a reusable playbook for marketers to operationalize causal targeting at scale, set guardrails, and align campaigns with strategic KPIs.

*Jorg Bornschein,Clare Lyle,Yazhe Li,Amal Rannen-Triki,Xu Owen He,Razvan Pascanu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified approach that combines fine-tuning with in-context learning by augmenting task-specific training data with in-context examples, outperforming both fine-tuning and prompt engineering alone while using efficient hyperparameter selection via prequential evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing LLM adaptation approaches: prompt engineering plateaus with more data while fine-tuning underperforms with scarce data. There's a need to bridge these two paradigms to leverage their respective strengths.

Method: Fine-tune LLMs on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples structured like k-shot prompts, combined with prequential evaluation for hyperparameter selection in low-data regimes to avoid expensive cross-validation.

Result: The unified approach consistently matches and often significantly exceeds the performance of both fine-tuning and in-context learning baselines across downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Combining in-context learning with fine-tuning creates a more effective adaptation method that leverages sample efficiency from in-context learning and performance gains from fine-tuning, with prequential evaluation providing efficient hyperparameter selection.

Abstract: When adapting large language models (LLMs) to a specific downstream task, two primary approaches are commonly employed: (1) prompt engineering, often with in-context few-shot learning, leveraging the model's inherent generalization abilities, and (2) fine-tuning on task-specific data, directly optimizing the model's parameters. While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks.

### [67] [Demystifying LLM-as-a-Judge: Analytically Tractable Model for Inference-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19905)
*Indranil Halder,Cengiz Pehlevan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes inference-time scaling in large language models through a Bayesian linear regression framework, showing that increasing inference samples generally improves performance but has limitations when reward models are misspecified, with optimal sampling strategies depending on temperature and task difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are shifting computational resources from training to inference time, but the principles behind inference-time scaling are not well understood, creating a need for analytical frameworks to study this phenomenon.

Method: Developed an analytically tractable model using Bayesian linear regression with reward-weighted sampling, analyzing high-dimensional regime with closed-form posterior expressions. Studied generalization error with training data from teacher models and tested experimentally with LLM-as-judge scenarios.

Result: Generalization error decreases with more inference samples when reward is similar to teacher, but reward misspecification creates finite optimal k. Found optimal sampling temperature for fixed k. Proved theoretical scaling of Θ(1/k²) for best-of-k with teacher reward, and showed inference-time compute advantage degrades with increased task difficulty.

Conclusion: Inference-time computation scaling is beneficial under proper reward specification, with quantifiable limits and optimal strategies, providing theoretical foundation for when inference scaling outperforms data collection.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models have shown advantages in reallocating a notable share of computational resource from training time to inference time. However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the "best-of-$k$" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.

*Maxime Lacour,Pu Ren,Rie Nakata,Nori Nakata,Michael Mahoney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CGM-FAS, a deep-learning approach using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model non-ergodic path effects in Fourier amplitude spectra for seismic hazard analysis, offering advantages over Gaussian Process methods in learning spatial patterns, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid, memory-efficient predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-ergodic ground-motion models improve seismic hazard prediction by incorporating spatial variations, but current Gaussian Process-based methods face computational limitations for large-scale predictions due to prescribed correlation functions and scalability issues.

Method: Develops CGM-FAS using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture trained on San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, with geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlations directly from data.

Result: CGM-FAS demonstrates consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects compared to a Gaussian Process-based GMM, and can generate maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory, with hyperparameters tunable for variability matching empirical models.

Conclusion: CGM-FAS shows promise as an efficient and scalable deep-learning alternative to Gaussian Process methods for non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains, enhancing seismic hazard analysis.

Abstract: Recent developments in non-ergodic ground-motion models (GMMs) explicitly model systematic spatial variations in source, site, and path effects, reducing standard deviation to 30-40% of ergodic models and enabling more accurate site-specific seismic hazard analysis. Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM. This work demonstrates a promising direction for efficient non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains.

*Jiayun Wu,Jiashuo Liu,Zhiyuan Zeng,Tianyang Zhan,Wenhao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training methods that optimize calibration scoring rules enable models to admit uncertainty by abstaining when unsure, allowing smaller LLMs to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification while achieving better accuracy-to-hallucination ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM hallucinations persist despite scaling improvements, as current training objectives prioritize mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty, and RLHF inadvertently incentivizes guessing rather than honest communication.

Method: Proposes behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning using strictly proper scoring rules to train models to output calibrated probabilities of correctness, enabling them to abstain from full responses or flag uncertain claims.

Result: Qwen3-4B model surpasses GPT-5 in accuracy-to-hallucination ratio (0.806 vs 0.207) on math reasoning, and achieves zero-shot calibration error comparable to frontier models on factual QA despite lower accuracy.

Conclusion: Behavioral calibration enables smaller models to excel at uncertainty quantification as a transferable meta-skill, providing a path to more reliable LLM deployment in critical domains by aligning model behavior with accuracy through calibrated abstention.

Abstract: LLM deployment in critical domains is currently impeded by persistent hallucinations--generating plausible but factually incorrect assertions. While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME). Moreover, in cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), our 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models including Grok-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, even though its factual accuracy is much lower.

TL;DR: Introduces a Common Task Framework (CTF) for machine learning in seismology to standardize evaluation of methods for wavefield forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization, addressing challenges in data and model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seismology struggles with forecasting and reconstruction tasks (e.g., earthquake early warning) due to large-scale simulations, inadequate Earth models, sparse real data, and lack of rigorous ML comparisons.

Method: Develops a CTF with three curated seismic wavefield datasets at global, crustal, and local scales, including task-specific metrics for forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints like noise and limited data.

Result: Illustrates the CTF by scoring methods on two datasets, showing performance of various ML techniques and foundation models in reconstructing wavefields from simulated and real-world sensor measurements.

Conclusion: The CTF aims to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets, enhancing rigor and reproducibility in scientific machine learning for seismology.

Abstract: Seismology faces fundamental challenges in state forecasting and reconstruction (e.g., earthquake early warning and ground motion prediction) and managing the parametric variability of source locations, mechanisms, and Earth models (e.g., subsurface structure and topography effects). Addressing these with simulations is hindered by their massive scale, both in synthetic data volumes and numerical complexity, while real-data efforts are constrained by models that inadequately reflect the Earth's complexity and by sparse sensor measurements from the field. Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes. Our vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets, raising the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.

### [71] [Conditional Adversarial Fragility in Financial Machine Learning under Macroeconomic Stress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19935)
*Samruddhi Baviskar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial vulnerability in financial ML models amplifies during economic stress periods, requiring regime-aware robustness evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial robustness evaluations assume static environments, but financial ML operates in nonstationary economic conditions where vulnerability may vary systematically.

Method: Proposed regime-aware evaluation framework using volatility-based segmentation, with adversarial testing across calm/stress periods while keeping model and attack methods constant. Added semantic auditing using LLMs for interpretability.

Result: Models show comparable baseline performance across regimes but exhibit significantly greater adversarial degradation during stress periods, with increased false negative rates that risk missing high-risk cases.

Conclusion: Adversarial robustness in financial ML is regime-dependent, necessitating stress-aware model risk assessment approaches for high-stakes deployments.

Abstract: Machine learning models used in financial decision systems operate in nonstationary economic environments, yet adversarial robustness is typically evaluated under static assumptions. This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.

TL;DR: LoFT-LLM is a pipeline combining low-frequency trend extraction, high-frequency residual modeling, and LLM-based semantic calibration for accurate few-shot time-series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep forecasting models use full-length windows with high-frequency noise, obscuring long-term trends, and underutilize auxiliary variables in few-shot settings.

Method: Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module extracts stable low-frequency trends from spectral patches, a residual learner models high-frequency variations, and a fine-tuned LLM refines predictions using auxiliary context via natural language prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets show LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines in full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: LoFT-LLM effectively addresses noise and data scarcity in time-series forecasting by integrating frequency-aware learning with LLM calibration, enhancing performance and practicality.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

### [75] [Control Variate Score Matching for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20003)
*Khaled Kahouli,Romuald Elie,Klaus-Robert Müller,Quentin Berthet,Oliver T. Unke,Arnaud Doucet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), a unified estimator combining Denoising Score Identity (DSI) and Target Score Identity (TSI) via control variates, with an optimal time-dependent coefficient to minimize variance across noise levels, enhancing sample efficiency in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models rely on estimating scores of noise-perturbed distributions, but standard estimators (DSI and TSI) suffer from a variance trade-off: DSI has high variance at low noise, while TSI has high variance at high noise levels. This work aims to reconcile these approaches to overcome the fundamental variance limitations.

Method: Unifies DSI and TSI within the principled framework of control variates, deriving the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI). It introduces an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum.

Result: CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling, demonstrating practical improvements over DSI and TSI individually.

Conclusion: The proposed CVSI effectively addresses the variance trade-off in score estimation for diffusion models by leveraging control variates, offering a principled solution that improves performance across noise regimes and enhances overall sampling efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a robust framework for sampling from unnormalized probability densities, which requires accurately estimating the score of the noise-perturbed target distribution. While the standard Denoising Score Identity (DSI) relies on data samples, access to the target energy function enables an alternative formulation via the Target Score Identity (TSI). However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecoKAN is an interpretable forecasting framework that uses Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose cryptocurrency time series and Kolmogorov-Arnold Network mixers for transparent modeling, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency data combines long-term trends and high-frequency fluctuations, but existing deep learning models are black-boxes that lack interpretability, hindering trustworthy financial decision-making.

Method: Propose DecoKAN, integrating multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform for signal decomposition and Kolmogorov-Arnold Network mixers for interpretable nonlinear modeling, with a symbolic analysis pipeline for enhanced transparency.

Result: DecoKAN achieves the lowest average Mean Squared Error on real-world cryptocurrency datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), consistently outperforming competitive state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: DecoKAN bridges predictive accuracy and model transparency, advancing trustworthy decision support in complex cryptocurrency markets by providing interpretability through decomposition and symbolic representations.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable forecasting of multivariate time series is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets in digital asset systems. Advanced deep learning methodologies, particularly Transformer-based and MLP-based architectures, have achieved competitive predictive performance in cryptocurrency forecasting tasks. However, cryptocurrency data is inherently composed of long-term socio-economic trends and local high-frequency speculative oscillations. Existing deep learning-based 'black-box' models fail to effectively decouple these composite dynamics or provide the interpretability needed for trustworthy financial decision-making. To overcome these limitations, we propose DecoKAN, an interpretable forecasting framework that integrates multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for decoupling and hierarchical signal decomposition with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) mixers for transparent and interpretable nonlinear modeling. The DWT component decomposes complex cryptocurrency time series into distinct frequency components, enabling frequency-specific analysis, while KAN mixers provide intrinsically interpretable spline-based mappings within each decomposed subseries. Furthermore, interpretability is enhanced through a symbolic analysis pipeline involving sparsification, pruning, and symbolization, which produces concise analytical expressions offering symbolic representations of the learned patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DecoKAN achieves the lowest average Mean Squared Error on all tested real-world cryptocurrency datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), consistently outperforming a comprehensive suite of competitive state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate DecoKAN's potential to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and model transparency, advancing trustworthy decision support within complex cryptocurrency markets.

*Sukumar Kishanthan,Asela Hevapathige*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed OGAB activation function with orthogonality and group-aware bias to handle class imbalance in deep learning by enhancing feature distinguishability during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning performance deteriorates under class imbalance, and traditional approaches modify data pre/post-processing rather than addressing it during training at the embedding level.

Method: OGAB activation function incorporates orthogonal transformations to preserve minority class information and group-aware bias to automatically identify clusters and enhance class separability without explicit supervision.

Result: Demonstrated consistent performance improvements on real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets compared to traditional and learnable activation functions.

Conclusion: OGAB provides an effective solution to class imbalance by introducing inductive biases through activation functions, working at the training phase without requiring explicit label information.

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning and data mining, often leading to suboptimal performance in classifiers. While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.

### [78] [An Optimal Policy for Learning Controllable Dynamics by Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20053)
*Peter N. Loxley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an optimal non-stationary policy for learning controllable Markov chain dynamics by exploring over a limited time horizon to maximize information gain greedily, with a parameterized control set and algorithm, addressing limitations from states like transient/absorbing/non-backtracking states through six examples and demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllable Markov chains are crucial for optimal control and reinforcement learning, but learning in unknown environments efficiently requires exploring to maximize information gain, necessitating policies that handle restrictive states like transient, absorbing, and non-backtracking states that impede control.

Method: A general optimal policy form is derived for exploring controllable dynamics, implemented simply and computed efficiently, with a greedy selection of controls from a time-varying constraint set parameterized simply, and an algorithm is presented to find the optimal policy.

Result: The policy enables agents to 'learn by exploring' effectively, demonstrating optimality through counting arguments, comparisons with suboptimal policies, and dynamic programming's sequential improvement property, as shown in six detailed examples of controllable dynamics.

Conclusion: A non-stationary policy is essential for optimal exploration in controllable Markov chains due to restrictive states, with the proposed policy offering a practical, efficient solution for learning in unknown environments, supported by theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Controllable Markov chains describe the dynamics of sequential decision making tasks and are the central component in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.

*Yanjie Li,Jian Xu,Xueqing Chen,Lina Yu,Shiming Xiang,Weijun Li,Cheng-lin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QE-Catalytic is a multimodal framework combining a large language model (Qwen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (Equiformer-V2) that improves adsorption energy prediction accuracy and enables inverse design of catalytic surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language-model-based approaches for catalyst screening suffer from insufficient accuracy in adsorption-configuration energy prediction and difficulty distinguishing between different configurations of the same system, even with graph-assisted pretraining methods like GAP-CATBERTa.

Method: Proposes QE-Catalytic framework that couples Qwen language model with Equiformer-V2 graph Transformer, leveraging both 3D structures and structured configuration text. Uses graph-text alignment to inject 3D geometric information into language channel, enabling text-based prediction without precise coordinates and autoregressive CIF file generation for structure design.

Result: On OC20 dataset, reduces MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713 eV to 0.486 eV, consistently outperforming baseline models like CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: QE-Catalytic demonstrates superior performance in adsorption energy prediction and enables both property prediction and inverse design capabilities for catalytic surface screening, bridging the gap between language-based and geometric approaches.

Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.
  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel benchmark dataset is introduced for anomaly detection in maritime traffic, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) to support graph-based methods across node, edge, and graph levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) work well in structured domains like road traffic but struggle in non-grid environments like maritime traffic due to lack of fixed nodes, sparse trajectories, and multi-granular anomalies.

Method: Extend OMTAD into a benchmark dataset for graph-based anomaly detection, evaluated at node, edge, and graph levels, using LLM-based agents (Trajectory Synthesizer and Anomaly Injector) to generate meaningful anomalies.

Result: Expectedly provides a systematic evaluation framework for anomaly detection in non-grid systems, supporting reproducible research and methodological advances.

Conclusion: This benchmark dataset aims to address challenges in maritime anomaly detection and promote progress in spatio-temporal graph methods for irregular environments.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in structured domains such as road traffic and public transportation, where spatial entities can be naturally represented as fixed nodes. In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.

TL;DR: PairFlow is a lightweight preprocessing method for Discrete Flow Models that enables few-step sampling without requiring pretrained teachers, achieving performance comparable to finetuning methods at only 1.7% of the compute cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) have strong generative performance but suffer from slow iterative sampling. Existing acceleration methods require substantial finetuning overhead, which is computationally expensive.

Method: PairFlow trains DFMs from coupled source-target distribution samples using a closed-form inversion technique to construct paired samples efficiently, eliminating the need for pretrained teachers.

Result: PairFlow matches or surpasses the performance of two-stage finetuning methods while using only up to 1.7% of the compute cost. It also provides stronger base models for subsequent distillation and further acceleration.

Conclusion: PairFlow is an effective and broadly applicable lightweight preprocessing framework that enables efficient few-step sampling for Discrete Flow Models across various data types including molecular data, binary images, and RGB images.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{PairFlow}$, a lightweight preprocessing step for training Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) to achieve few-step sampling without requiring a pretrained teacher. DFMs have recently emerged as a new class of generative models for discrete data, offering strong performance. However, they suffer from slow sampling due to their iterative nature. Existing acceleration methods largely depend on finetuning, which introduces substantial additional training overhead. $\texttt{PairFlow}$ addresses this issue with a lightweight preprocessing step. Inspired by ReFlow and its extension to DFMs, we train DFMs from coupled samples of source and target distributions, without requiring any pretrained teacher. At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning. Furthermore, models trained with our framework provide stronger base models for subsequent distillation, yielding further acceleration after finetuning. Experiments on molecular data as well as binary and RGB images demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: TableGPT-R1 is a tabular model using reinforcement learning to improve reasoning and code execution for complex table tasks, outperforming baselines on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs fine-tuned via SFT often lack robust multi-step reasoning and code execution for real-world table tasks, with RL challenges like scarce trajectories, heterogeneous feedback, and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Systematic RL framework with a data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories, an adaptive reward system with rule-based verification and reward shaping, and multi-stage training to stabilize reasoning.

Result: TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning effectively enhances reasoning on complex tables, with TableGPT-R1 addressing key hurdles and demonstrating superior performance, making it a viable solution for advanced tabular data analysis.

Abstract: Tabular data serves as the backbone of modern data analysis and scientific research. While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities.

Method: Proposes Clust-PSI-PFL, which computes a weighted PSI metric (WPSI^L) to quantify non-IID levels, uses PSI features for K-means++ clustering with silhouette-based optimal cluster selection.

Result: Achieves up to 18% higher global accuracy and 37% relative improvement in client fairness compared to baselines across diverse datasets and partition protocols.

Conclusion: PSI-guided clustering is an effective, lightweight approach for robust personalized federated learning under label skew, enhancing performance and equity.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) supports privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning (ML) model training by keeping data on client devices. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.

*Mihai Suteu,Ovidiu Serban*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TSσBN) replaces shared normalization with task-specific variants in multi-task learning, achieving competitive performance with high parameter efficiency without complex architectural designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task learning faces challenges in balancing resources and mitigating interference between tasks. Complex architectural solutions often increase overhead and complexity, questioning whether simpler approaches could suffice.

Method: Proposes TSσBN - replacing shared normalization layers with task-specific sigmoid batch normalization, allowing tasks to softly allocate network capacity while sharing feature extractors.

Result: TSσBN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext datasets while remaining highly parameter-efficient.

Conclusion: Complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary; task-specific normalization offers a simple, interpretable, and efficient alternative that provides insights into capacity allocation and task relationships.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to leverage shared knowledge across tasks to improve generalization and parameter efficiency, yet balancing resources and mitigating interference remain open challenges. Architectural solutions often introduce elaborate task-specific modules or routing schemes, increasing complexity and overhead. In this work, we show that normalization layers alone are sufficient to address many of these challenges. Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors. TS$σ$BN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, while remaining highly parameter-efficient. Moreover, its learned gates provide a natural framework for analyzing MTL dynamics, offering interpretable insights into capacity allocation, filter specialization, and task relationships. Our findings suggest that complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary and that task-specific normalization offers a simple, interpretable, and efficient alternative.

*Zuo Wang,Ye Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JSDMP is a new graph learning paradigm that uses Jensen-Shannon divergence to capture both similarity and dissimilarity between contextual and structural information in rich-text graphs, leading to improved representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the contextual and structural divergence problem in rich-text graphs and aims to better integrate both types of information for more effective representation learning.

Method: Proposed JSDMP paradigm that computes message weights using Jensen-Shannon divergence to capture similarity and dissimilarity between text nodes. Implemented two GNN variants: DMPGCN and DMPPRG.

Result: Extensive experiments on rich-text datasets show that both DMPGCN and DMPPRG outperform state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The JSDMP paradigm effectively addresses contextual and structural divergence in rich-text graphs, enabling better representation learning through joint consideration of similarity and dissimilarity.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how the widely existing contextual and structural divergence may influence the representation learning in rich-text graphs. To this end, we propose Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing (JSDMP), a new learning paradigm for rich-text graph representation learning. Besides considering similarity regarding structure and text, JSDMP further captures their corresponding dissimilarity by Jensen-Shannon divergence. Similarity and dissimilarity are then jointly used to compute new message weights among text nodes, thus enabling representations to learn with contextual and structural information from truly correlated text nodes. With JSDMP, we propose two novel graph neural networks, namely Divergent message-passing graph convolutional network (DMPGCN) and Divergent message-passing Page-Rank graph neural networks (DMPPRG), for learning representations in rich-text graphs. DMPGCN and DMPPRG have been extensively texted on well-established rich-text datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. The experimental results show that DMPGCN and DMPPRG can outperform other baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing paradigm

*Rui Pan,Zhuofu Chen,Ravi Netravali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FailFast is a speculative decoding framework that uses diffusion LLMs as drafters to accelerate autoregressive LLMs, achieving up to 4.9x speedup by dynamically adapting draft lengths to minimize rejection latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion LLMs offer fast parallel token generation but suffer from an efficiency-quality tradeoff when used standalone. The authors aim to leverage dLLMs' speed advantages specifically for speculative decoding with autoregressive verifiers.

Method: FailFast uses dLLMs as drafters in speculative decoding, with the core insight that dLLM's parallel decoding speed lowers rejection risk. It dynamically adapts speculation length - 'fails fast' in hard regions and 'wins big' in easy regions by speculating up to 70 tokens at once.

Result: Without fine-tuning, FailFast achieves lossless acceleration with up to 4.9x speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7x over naive dLLM drafters, and 1.4x over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads.

Conclusion: Carefully applied dLLMs can be highly effective as speculative drafters, with FailFast demonstrating significant speedups through dynamic length adaptation that leverages dLLMs' parallel decoding strengths to minimize rejection costs.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. We open-source FailFast at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/failfast.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies for two-state Bernoulli bandits, showing they achieve bounded regret in symmetric cases and logarithmic regret in one-fair-coin scenarios, matching optimal asymptotic bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a fundamental analysis of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in sequential learning using Information Directed Sampling policies, and to create a pedagogical bridge between reinforcement learning and information theory for statistical physicists.

Method: Extended IDS framework to discounted infinite-horizon setting with modified information measure and tuning parameter; analyzed two problem classes: symmetric bandits and one-fair-coin scenario.

Result: IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret in symmetric bandits and logarithmic regret scaling in one-fair-coin scenario, matching classical asymptotic lower bounds.

Conclusion: IDS policies provide effective heuristics for balancing exploration and exploitation in multi-armed bandit problems, achieving optimal regret bounds in the analyzed scenarios while serving as a pedagogical tool connecting RL and information theory.

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit problem provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the tension between exploration and exploitation in sequential learning. This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.

TL;DR: Introduces Performative Policy Gradient (PePG), the first policy gradient algorithm in RL accounting for performativity, proving convergence to performatively optimal policies under distribution shifts and validating superior performance empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-deployment RL algorithms often influence their environments and shift underlying dynamics, which standard RL methods ignore; this performative setting is under-explored in RL compared to supervised learning, necessitating algorithms that account for these shifts.

Method: Proves performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and policy gradient theorem; introduces PePG algorithm, a policy gradient method designed to account for performativity, analyzed under softmax parametrisation with and without entropy regularisation.

Result: Proves PePG converges to performatively optimal policies that remain optimal under self-induced distribution shifts, extending prior works focused only on stability; empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments shows PePG outperforms standard policy gradient and existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.

Conclusion: PePG successfully addresses performativity in RL by adapting policy gradient methods to distribution shifts, achieving optimality rather than just stability, and demonstrates practical effectiveness through empirical validation, advancing performative RL research.

Abstract: Post-deployment machine learning algorithms often influence the environments they act in, and thus shift the underlying dynamics that the standard reinforcement learning (RL) methods ignore. While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.

### [89] [Sample-Efficient Policy Constraint Offline Deep Reinforcement Learning based on Sample Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20115)
*Yuanhao Chen,Qi Liu,Pengbin Chen,Zhongjian Qiao,Yanjie Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a sample filtering method for policy constraint offline RL, scoring transitions by episode reward metrics and using high-score transitions to improve learning speed, sample efficiency, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL suffers from distribution shift. Policy constraint methods address this but depend heavily on behavior policy quality. Existing methods using all transitions can be trapped by low-reward transitions, leading to slow learning, low sample efficiency, and suboptimal performance. The authors aim to improve sampling in policy constraint offline RL.

Method: The paper proposes a sample filtering method for policy constraint offline RL. First, transitions are scored using average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset. High-score transitions are then extracted and used to train offline RL algorithms.

Result: Experimental results across multiple offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks show that the proposed filtering method outperforms baselines, improving sample efficiency and final performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that filtering transition samples based on episode reward metrics effectively addresses the limitations of existing policy constraint methods, improving learning speed, sample efficiency, and final performance across various offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.

TL;DR: A method called 'internal RL' enables more efficient learning in autoregressive models by using internal representations and temporally-abstract actions for hierarchical reinforcement learning, especially with sparse rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reinforcement learning with autoregressive models explores token-by-token, leading to inefficient learning under sparse rewards, which this work aims to overcome.

Method: Introduces a higher-order, non-causal sequence model that controls the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model to discover latent controllers for temporally-abstract actions.

Result: The higher-order model compresses long activation sequences into controllers that execute behaviorally meaningful actions over long timescales with learned termination, enabling efficient exploration and learning from sparse rewards.

Conclusion: Internal RL, by reinforcing latent controllers, overcomes token-by-token exploration inefficiencies, offering a promising approach for hierarchical reinforcement learning within foundation models.

Abstract: Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term "internal RL", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reasoning in LLMs by treating it as a latent variable modeling problem, deriving learning objectives, and evaluating different sampling techniques.

Method: Develop EM-based learning for reasoning, instantiate sampling schemes (rejection sampling, STaR, PPS), and test on ARC, MMLU, OpenBookQA with Llama and Qwen models.

Result: Sampling scheme significantly affects reasoning model accuracy; PPS outperforms other schemes despite its simplicity, leading to better results.

Conclusion: Formalizing reasoning via EM and optimized sampling, especially PPS, enhances LLM reasoning performance, highlighting the importance of sampling design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) solve reasoning problems by first generating a rationale and then answering. We formalize reasoning as a latent variable model and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) objective for learning to reason. This view connects EM and modern reward-based optimization, and shows that the main challenge lies in designing a sampling distribution that generates rationales that justify correct answers. We instantiate and compare several sampling schemes: rejection sampling with a budget, self-taught reasoner (STaR), and prompt posterior sampling (PPS), which only keeps the rationalization stage of STaR. Our experiments on the ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with the Llama and Qwen models show that the sampling scheme can significantly affect the accuracy of learned reasoning models. Despite its simplicity, we observe that PPS outperforms the other sampling schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing global gridded crop models (GGCMs) have uncertainties in simulating biophysical processes, while pure machine learning models struggle to generalize beyond training data, particularly under climate change, creating a need for a more reliable approach.

Method: Develop NeuralCrop by integrating a process-based GGCM with data-driven machine learning, trained first to emulate the GGCM and then fine-tuned on observational data.

Result: NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs in site-level and large-scale regions, accurately reproduces interannual yield anomalies from 2000-2019, especially under drought, and generalizes better than pure machine learning models.

Conclusion: Hybrid crop modeling offers improved accuracy and reliability for yield projections under climate change and extreme weather, bridging process-based and data-driven strengths.

Abstract: Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) simulate daily crop growth by explicitly representing key biophysical processes and project end-of-season yield time series. They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes offline multitask reinforcement learning where tasks share a low-rank representation of action-value functions, proving generalization guarantees and benefits from data pooling and representation reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit shared structure across tasks in offline RL to improve statistical efficiency and generalization without online interaction.

Method: Multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on fixed offline datasets.

Result: Finite-sample generalization guarantees show improved estimation with a $1/\sqrt{nT}$ sample dependence across tasks, and downstream task analysis indicates reduced learning complexity when reusing the learned representation.

Conclusion: Shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning enhance generalization and efficiency, particularly in model-free, value-based RL settings.

Abstract: We study offline multitask reinforcement learning in settings where multiple tasks share a low-rank representation of their action-value functions. In this regime, a learner is provided with fixed datasets collected from several related tasks, without access to further online interaction, and seeks to exploit shared structure to improve statistical efficiency and generalization. We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch. Together, our results clarify the role of shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning and provide theoretical insight into when and how multitask structure can improve generalization in model-free, value-based reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-task learning for load forecasting is limited to offline methods that cannot capture dynamic changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities, necessitating an adaptive approach.

Method: Uses vector-valued hidden Markov models with a recursive process to update model parameters in real-time, enabling dynamic adaptation to changing patterns and providing probabilistic predictions.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in both forecasting accuracy and uncertainty assessment when tested on datasets with diverse and dynamic consumption patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive multi-task learning framework effectively handles dynamic changes in load patterns and provides reliable probabilistic forecasts, representing a significant improvement over traditional offline methods.

Abstract: Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings) is crucial for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.

TL;DR: Sampling algorithms and hyperparameters in diffusion models significantly influence bias amplification, showing that bias is not inherent but can be controlled through sampling choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models replicate and amplify dataset biases, but previous research treated this as inherent rather than examining how sampling methods affect bias.

Method: Conducted controlled studies using Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST, BFFHQ datasets and Stable Diffusion, analyzing different sampling algorithms and hyperparameters while keeping the trained model fixed.

Result: Sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, demonstrating that bias amplification is not fixed but can be controlled through sampling choices.

Conclusion: Bias amplification in diffusion models is not an inherent property but is significantly influenced by sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters, offering a pathway to mitigate dataset biases.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various image synthesis tasks, yet their tendency to replicate and amplify dataset biases remains poorly understood. Although previous research has viewed bias amplification as an inherent characteristic of diffusion models, this work provides the first analysis of how sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters influence bias amplification. We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal brain decoding faces challenges with cross-subject generalization and interpretability - existing methods struggle with functional brain topology heterogeneity across subjects and limitations of manual/black-box prompting approaches.

Method: 1) fMRI encoder with multi-atlas soft functional parcellations as shared space and voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism; 2) Interpretable prompt optimization using locally deployed Qwen model for iterative generation/selection; 3) Parameterized decoding constraints during inference.

Result: Achieves leading-level results on NSD dataset with clear improvements in BLEU-4 and CIDEr metrics under cross-subject settings compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: BrainROI successfully addresses key challenges in brain decoding through novel fMRI encoding, interpretable prompting, and decoding constraints, enabling more stable and transferable semantic reconstruction from brain activity.

Abstract: Multimodal brain decoding aims to reconstruct semantic information that is consistent with visual stimuli from brain activity signals such as fMRI, and then generate readable natural language descriptions. However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.

TL;DR: DeepONet surrogate coupled with EKI enables fast, accurate inverse modeling for moving boundary problems, accelerating parameter estimation for RTM processes by orders of magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a fast, accurate emulator for moving boundary systems that can be integrated into digital twin platforms, enabling real-time parameter estimation and control for processes like Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM).

Method: The method employs a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.

Result: The results show that the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared to full-model EKI, enabling real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that neural operator learning with DeepONet provides a powerful framework for fast, accurate emulators of moving boundary systems, enabling their effective integration into digital twin platforms for real-time monitoring and control.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that neural operator learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for building fast, accurate emulators of moving boundary systems, enabling their integration into digital twin platforms. To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.
  The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows. Unlike prior approaches for RTM inversion that learn mesh-dependent mappings, the proposed neural operator generalises across spatial and temporal domains, enabling evaluation at arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, and represents a significant step toward practical industrial deployment of digital twins.

*Yuanjian Xu,Yuan Shuai,Jianing Hao,Guang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A GAN framework for Neural SDEs using Neural Hermite functions to build efficient discriminators with theoretical guarantees and superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical bottleneck in designing discriminators for Neural SDEs that can faithfully capture temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior approaches using Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate adversarial training instability.

Method: The authors propose HGAN-SDEs, which use Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator within a GAN framework. This leverages Hermite functions as an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics.

Result: Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs.

Conclusion: The HGAN-SDE framework presents an effective approach to generative modeling for SDEs, with both theoretical guarantees and strong empirical evidence supporting its advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) provide a principled framework for modeling continuous-time stochastic processes and have been widely adopted in fields ranging from physics to finance. Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs

*Yuxing Gan,Ziyu Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CDSP-MoE addresses catastrophic forgetting and instruction-overfitting in Mixture-of-Experts models by dynamically instantiating experts within shared parameter subspaces using learnable topology masks and gradient conflict-driven pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE architectures suffer from structural parameter isolation causing catastrophic forgetting and instruction-overfitting that degrades performance in instruction-free scenarios.

Method: Proposes CDSP-MoE framework with a parameter backbone where logical experts are dynamically instantiated via learnable topology masks, using gradient conflict as structural supervision through a Lagged Gradient Game to prune conflicting pathways.

Result: Experimental results show CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without task labels and maintains semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols without explicit instructions.

Conclusion: CDSP-MoE enables interpretable modular structures through dynamic expert instantiation in shared subspaces, overcoming fundamental limitations of traditional MoE architectures.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve parameter efficiency through conditional computation, yet contemporary designs suffer from two fundamental limitations: structural parameter isolation that causes catastrophic forgetting, and instruction-overfitting that degrades performance in instruction-free scenarios. We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

*Mrinmay Sen,Subhrajit Nag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDPC is a new FL method that mitigates data heterogeneity and partial client participation by projecting local updates onto previous global updates and using adaptive scaling, improving training speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity in FL causes variance in local updates, shifting the global model away from optimum, and partial client participation worsens this by skewing aggregation, leading to instability and poor performance in training.

Method: FedDPC projects each local update onto the previous global update to control variance in local and global updates and employs adaptive scaling for local updates before aggregation to accelerate training.

Result: Experiments on image classification with heterogeneously partitioned datasets show FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster training loss reduction and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.

Conclusion: FedDPC effectively addresses both data heterogeneity and partial client participation, enhancing FL training stability, speed, and global model performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) in the ALICE experiment at CERN by blending traditional physics knowledge with modern data-driven machine learning techniques, improving accuracy and robustness.

Method: Uses Normalizing Flows in a teacher-student generative framework, introduces a novel loss function and an output variability-based scaling mechanism to enhance model accuracy for particle shower spatial distribution and morphology.

Result: The approach outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation and achieves models that are 421 times faster than existing NF implementations in ZDC simulation literature.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that physics-based machine learning, incorporating domain knowledge through novel loss functions and scaling mechanisms, significantly improves simulation accuracy and speed for particle detectors like the ZDC in ALICE experiment.

Abstract: Physics-based machine learning blends traditional science with modern data-driven techniques. Rather than relying exclusively on empirical data or predefined equations, this methodology embeds domain knowledge directly into the learning process, resulting in models that are both more accurate and robust. We leverage this paradigm to accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) of the ALICE experiment at CERN. Our method introduces a novel loss function and an output variability-based scaling mechanism, which enhance the model's capability to accurately represent the spatial distribution and morphology of particle showers in detector outputs while mitigating the influence of rare artefacts on the training. Leveraging Normalizing Flows (NFs) in a teacher-student generative framework, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation but also yields models that are 421 times faster than existing NF implementations in ZDC simulation literature.

TL;DR: A hybrid physics-guided neural network for vessel shaft power prediction outperforms traditional methods and baseline neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing fuel consumption in maritime operations is vital due to its cost and emission impacts, but existing empirical formulas struggle with dynamic conditions like sea state or fouling.

Method: Develop a hybrid approach combining neural networks with empirical formulas, integrating physics-based knowledge into the network architecture.

Result: The proposed method achieves lower MAE, RMSE, and MAPE on data from four cargo vessels compared to both empirical formulas and baseline neural networks.

Conclusion: Integrating physics guidance into neural networks enhances accuracy and reliability for vessel shaft power prediction, offering practical benefits in reducing costs and emissions.

Abstract: Optimizing maritime operations, particularly fuel consumption for vessels, is crucial, considering its significant share in global trade. As fuel consumption is closely related to the shaft power of a vessel, predicting shaft power accurately is a crucial problem that requires careful consideration to minimize costs and emissions. Traditional approaches, which incorporate empirical formulas, often struggle to model dynamic conditions, such as sea conditions or fouling on vessels. In this paper, we present a hybrid, physics-guided neural network-based approach that utilizes empirical formulas within the network to combine the advantages of both neural networks and traditional techniques. We evaluate the presented method using data obtained from four similar-sized cargo vessels and compare the results with those of a baseline neural network and a traditional approach that employs empirical formulas. The experimental results demonstrate that the physics-guided neural network approach achieves lower mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error for all tested vessels compared to both the empirical formula-based method and the base neural network.

TL;DR: Field-Space Attention: A mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space, enabling interpretable internal states and facilitating enforcement of scientific constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and physically consistent modeling of Earth system dynamics requires machine-learning architectures that operate directly on continuous geophysical fields and preserve their underlying geometric structure.

Method: The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities of standard single-scale Vision Transformers.

Result: Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling.

Conclusion: The results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling across complex, irregular domains and nonlinear physical regimes by incorporating geometry-aware context.

Method: Replace standard attention with GALE, coupling physics-aware self-attention on state slices with cross-attention to shared geometry/global/boundary-condition context from multi-scale ball queries.

Result: Benchmarks on datasets (e.g., DrivAerML) show better accuracy, improved robustness to geometry/regime shifts, and favorable data efficiency compared to baselines like Domino.

Conclusion: GeoTransolver advances operator learning by unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention in a scalable transformer, enabling effective surrogate modeling.

Abstract: We present GeoTransolver, a Multiscale Geometry-Aware Physics Attention Transformer for CAE that replaces standard attention with GALE, coupling physics-aware self-attention on learned state slices with cross-attention to a shared geometry/global/boundary-condition context computed from multi-scale ball queries (inspired by DoMINO) and reused in every block. Implemented and released in NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, GeoTransolver persistently projects geometry, global and boundary condition parameters into physical state spaces to anchor latent computations to domain structure and operating regimes. We benchmark GeoTransolver on DrivAerML, Luminary SHIFT-SUV, and Luminary SHIFT-Wing, comparing against Domino, Transolver (as released in PhysicsNeMo), and literature-reported AB-UPT, and evaluate drag/lift R2 and Relative L1 errors for field variables. GeoTransolver delivers better accuracy, improved robustness to geometry/regime shifts, and favorable data efficiency; we include ablations on DrivAerML and qualitative results such as contour plots and design trends for the best GeoTransolver models. By unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention in a scalable transformer, GeoTransolver advances operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling across complex, irregular domains and non-linear physical regimes.

*Xuan-An Le,Minh-Nam Tran,Son Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRIDGE is a method for distilling knowledge from large models to tiny ones using a mid-sized Teacher Assistant to bridge the capacity gap, reduce API costs, and improve student performance with limited resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The capacity-budget trap: large models (e.g., GPT-4) and tiny models (<1B parameters) have a 1000x capacity gap, making direct distillation ineffective, while high API costs restrict extensive data collection.

Method: A two-phase framework: Phase 1 trains a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA) on a limited data subset selected via a zero-API pipeline; Phase 2 uses TA to generate synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student with instruction-tuning.

Result: Experiments show BRIDGE improves student performance by 28-41%, reduces the gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16%, and uses only 5% of resources compared to baselines with 100% budget.

Conclusion: BRIDGE effectively overcomes the capacity-budget trap, offering a cost-efficient solution for distilling knowledge to deployable tiny models while defying traditional cost-performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Distilling knowledge from large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) to tiny deployable models (less than 1B parameters) faces a critical capacity-budget trap: the 1000x capacity gap between teachers and students prevents effective direct transfer, while API costs prohibit extensive data collection. We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User frustration in mobile apps and websites can lead to lost sales and complaints, necessitating prediction methods.

Method: Defines frustration via rules on rage bursts, navigation issues, etc., processes 5.4M clickstream events into features, and trains classifiers including XGBoost and LSTM.

Result: XGBoost achieves 90% accuracy and ROC AUC 0.9579; LSTM performs best with 91% accuracy and ROC AUC 0.9705, with reliable prediction from first 20-30 interactions.

Conclusion: LSTM is effective for early frustration prediction, offering potential to improve user experience and reduce business losses.

Abstract: Many businesses depend on their mobile apps and websites, so user frustration while trying to complete a task on these channels can cause lost sales and complaints. In this research, I use clickstream data from a real e-commerce site to predict whether a session is frustrated or not. Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier. XGBoost reaches about 90% accuracy, ROC AUC of 0.9579, while the LSTM performs best with about 91% accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.9705. Finally, the research shows that with only the first 20 to 30 interactions, the LSTM already predicts frustration reliably.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series forecasts need explainability for user trust and transparency requirements, but current SHAP implementations lack efficient time-series support and often assume feature independence in counterfactual sampling.

Method: Leverages Transformer architecture with attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets, providing sampling-free explanations without assuming feature independence.

Result: Generates explanations in under one second (orders of magnitude faster than SHAP Permutation Explainer), provides accurate explanations on synthetic data with ground truth, and achieves competitive predictive performance on real-world electrical load data while identifying key predictors.

Conclusion: SHAPformer offers an efficient and accurate solution for explainable time-series forecasting, delivering meaningful local and global insights with significantly faster explanation generation than existing methods.

Abstract: Time-series forecasts are essential for planning and decision-making in many domains. Explainability is key to building user trust and meeting transparency requirements. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Statistical methods for measuring tagging consistency show agreement metrics over multiple iterations improve data quality assessment, and collecting quality data doesn't require multiple tags per item.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training data quality control has received little attention in literature despite significant variation in data quality from hand-tagging exercises; there's a need for better methods to evaluate and enhance hand-tagged training data quality.

Method: Used statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement, analyzing variance across multiple tagging iterations and proposing methods to collect high-quality data without requiring multiple tags per work item.

Result: Agreement metrics give more reliable results when recorded over multiple iterations; declining variance in such recordings indicates increasing data quality; methods can collect high-quality data without multiple tags per item; tagger burn-in may not sufficiently minimize errors.

Conclusion: High-quality hand-tagged training data requires robust quality control methods that go beyond simple measures like tagger burn-in periods; agreement metrics over multiple tagging iterations provide more reliable indicators of data quality.

Abstract: Hand-tagged training data is essential to many machine learning tasks. However, training data quality control has received little attention in the literature, despite data quality varying considerably with the tagging exercise. We propose methods to evaluate and enhance the quality of hand-tagged training data using statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement. We show that agreement metrics give more reliable results if recorded over multiple iterations of tagging, where declining variance in such recordings is an indicator of increasing data quality. We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors.

TL;DR: The paper interprets ReLU neural network outputs as values of a zero-sum stopping game, providing a game-theoretic framework for analysis, robustness verification, and inverse optimization in training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a novel interpretation of ReLU neural networks through game theory, linking network evaluation to dynamic game recursion and enabling new analytical tools for bounds, robustness verification, and training.

Method: Introduces the ReLU net game, a zero-sum turn-based stopping game running opposite the network, with input as terminal reward. Uses Shapley-Bellman backward recursion to equate network evaluation to game value, deriving a Feynman-Kac-type path integral formula. Extends approach to Softplus networks via entropic regularization.

Result: Shows network output equals game value via backward recursion, provides path-integral representation, enables input-output bounding using monotonicity of Shapley operators, allows robustness verification with policies as certificates, and reframes training as inverse game problem. Generalizes to Softplus networks.

Conclusion: The game-theoretic representation offers a powerful framework for analyzing and manipulating ReLU and Softplus neural networks, facilitating theoretical insights and practical applications in bounding, robustness, and training as inverse optimization.

Abstract: We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.

TL;DR: The paper presents a unifying theoretical framework explaining simplicity bias in neural networks through saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics, showing how different architectures progressively learn more complex solutions over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread observation of simplicity bias (neural networks learning increasingly complex solutions over time), existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework that works across different neural network architectures.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework analyzing saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for general neural networks, examining fixed points, invariant manifolds, and gradient descent dynamics. They apply this to linear networks, ReLU networks, convolutional networks, and self-attention models.

Result: The framework shows that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with increasing kinks, convolutional networks learn with increasing kernels, and self-attention models learn with increasing attention heads. It also explains how data distribution and weight initialization affect learning plateaus.

Conclusion: The theory provides a unifying framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions across various neural network architectures through saddle-to-saddle dynamics.

Abstract: Neural networks trained with gradient descent often learn solutions of increasing complexity over time, a phenomenon known as simplicity bias. Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions.

Motivation: WiP prediction is critical for predictive process monitoring to anticipate workload fluctuations and optimize operational planning, requiring advanced methods for accuracy and robustness.

Method: The framework transforms structured event logs into natural language stories embedded in semantic memory, uses predictor and assistant agents for retrieval and signal extraction, and synthesizes predictions via a fusion agent with ReAct-style reasoning.

Result: Evaluation on two real-world datasets shows it achieves a MAPE of 1.50% on one, outperforming TCN, LSTM, and persistence baselines, demonstrating competitive accuracy and improved robustness.

Conclusion: The integration of retrieval mechanisms and multi-agent reasoning proves effective for WiP prediction, enhancing predictive performance and reliability in operational contexts.

Abstract: Work-in-Progress (WiP) prediction is critical for predictive process monitoring, enabling accurate anticipation of workload fluctuations and optimized operational planning. This paper proposes a retrieval-augmented, multi-agent framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and collaborative multi-agent reasoning for WiP prediction. The narrative generation component transforms structured event logs into semantically rich natural language stories, which are embedded into a semantic vector-based process memory to facilitate dynamic retrieval of historical context during inference. The framework includes predictor agents that independently leverage retrieved historical contexts and a decision-making assistant agent that extracts high-level descriptive signals from recent events. A fusion agent then synthesizes predictions using ReAct-style reasoning over agent outputs and retrieved narratives. We evaluate our framework on two real-world benchmark datasets. Results show that the proposed retrieval-augmented multi-agent approach achieves competitive prediction accuracy, obtaining a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.50\% on one dataset, and surpassing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and persistence baselines. The results highlight improved robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating retrieval mechanisms and multi-agent reasoning in WiP prediction.

TL;DR: HumanATLF is a logic that extends natural strategies with fuzzy semantics and resource-bound actions to better model human decision-making in multi-agent systems, addressing limitations of idealized assumptions in formal strategic reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MAS models assume arbitrarily complex strategies, zero-cost actions, and crisp game structures, which don't reflect real human decision-making that involves bounded rationality, action costs, and uncertainty.

Method: The paper introduces HumanATLF logic that combines natural strategies with fuzzy semantics and resource-bound actions, where actions have real-valued costs drawn from a non-refillable budget, and atomic conditions/goals have degrees in [0,1].

Result: Model checking is in P when strategy complexity and resource budget are fixed, NP-complete with one strategic operator over Boolean objectives, and Δ²P-complete when both parameters vary. Recall-based strategies are decidable in PSPACE. Implementation in VITAMIN tool validated on drone rescue scenario.

Conclusion: HumanATLF provides a more realistic framework for strategic reasoning by incorporating resource constraints and uncertainty, with established computational complexity results and practical implementation.

Abstract: In formal strategic reasoning for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), agents are typically assumed to (i) employ arbitrarily complex strategies, (ii) execute each move at zero cost, and (iii) operate over fully crisp game structures. These idealized assumptions stand in stark contrast with human decision making in real world environments. The natural strategies framework along with some of its recent variants, partially addresses this gap by restricting strategies to concise rules guarded by regular expressions. Yet, it still overlook both the cost of each action and the uncertainty that often characterizes human perception of facts over the time. In this work, we introduce HumanATLF, a logic that builds upon natural strategies employing both fuzzy semantics and resource bound actions: each action carries a real valued cost drawn from a non refillable budget, and atomic conditions and goals have degrees in [0,1]. We give a formal syntax and semantics, and prove that model checking is in P when both the strategy complexity k and resource budget b are fixed, NP complete if just one strategic operator over Boolean objectives is allowed, and Delta^P_2 complete when k and b vary. Moreover, we show that recall based strategies can be decided in PSPACE. We implement our algorithms in VITAMIN, an open source model checking tool for MAS and validate them on an adversarial resource aware drone rescue scenario.
