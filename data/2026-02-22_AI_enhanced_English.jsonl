Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways). Results reveal that hard braking and acceleration frequencies emerge as the most influential features. Such improvements are more pronounced under congested, low-speed traffic conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMCAformer uses CV data to integrate macro traffic features with micro driving behavior features for improved speed prediction, reducing errors and uncertainty.", "motivation": "Accurate speed prediction is essential for proactive traffic management.

The approach aggregates system state information, including electricity demand, renewable generation, weather forecasts, and recent electricity prices, into a set of statistical features that are formatted as natural-language prompts and fed to an LLM along with general instructions. The model then determines the likelihood that the next day would be a spike day and reports a confidence score. Using historical data from the Texas electricity market, we demonstrate that this few-shot approach achieves performance comparable to supervised machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and outperforms the latter two when limited historical data are available. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a data-efficient tool for classifying electricity price spikes in settings with scarce data.", "AI": {"tldr": "A few-shot classification framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) predicts electricity price spikes by aggregating system state data into natural-language prompts, achieving performance comparable to supervised models in the Texas market and excelling with limited data.", "motivation": "There is a need for data-efficient methods to predict electricity price spikes in settings with scarce historical data, as traditional supervised models may underperform without extensive datasets.", "method": "The approach aggregates electricity demand, renewable generation, weather forecasts, and recent prices into statistical features, formats them as natural-language prompts, and feeds these along with general instructions to an LLM for few-shot classification with confidence scoring.", "result": "Using Texas market data, the few-shot LLM framework achieves performance comparable to Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and outperforms them when historical data is limited.", "conclusion": "LLMs offer significant potential as data-efficient tools for classifying electricity price spikes in data-scarce environments, bridging the gap in settings where traditional models may struggle due to insufficient data availability."}}
