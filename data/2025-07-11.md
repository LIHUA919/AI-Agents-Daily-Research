### [1] [Autonomous Control Leveraging LLMs: An Agentic Framework for Next-Generation Industrial Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07115)
*Javal Vyas,Mehmet Mercangoz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified agentic framework using LLMs for fault-recovery planning and continuous control in chemical processes, validated through case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing workforce shortages and complex fault scenarios in chemical processes by integrating symbolic reasoning with adaptive control.

Method: Combines LLMs with Finite State Machines (FSMs) for planning, simulation, and validation, tested on random FSMs and a TCLab platform.

Result: GPT-4o achieves 100% success in valid-path recovery; LLM-based controller matches PID performance and handles nonlinear dynamics.

Conclusion: LLMs with structured feedback can unify symbolic planning and continuous control, enhancing automation resilience in chemical engineering.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent system (cmbagent) using 30 LLM agents automates scientific research tasks without human intervention, excelling in a PhD-level cosmology task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate complex scientific research tasks by leveraging specialized LLM agents for efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Uses a Planning & Control strategy with 30 specialized LLM agents for tasks like retrieval, coding, and critique, executing code locally.

Result: Successfully performed a PhD-level cosmology task, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs on benchmarks.

Conclusion: cmbagent demonstrates effective automation of scientific research, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks,
cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents
and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic
workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a
different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases,
writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and
the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to
carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological
parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark
sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code
is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system
is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.

### [3] [BOOST: Out-of-Distribution-Informed Adaptive Sampling for Bias Mitigation in Stylistic Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07134)
*Mridula Vijendran,Shuang Chen,Jingjing Deng,Hubert P. H. Shum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in AI for painting classification, proposing BOOST, a method to mitigate bias by dynamically adjusting sampling and tuning, evaluated on KaoKore and PACS datasets with a new metric, SODC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in AI, especially in art classification, undermines fairness and accuracy, particularly for underrepresented styles. Existing methods overlook bias in out-of-distribution data.

Method: Proposes BOOST, an OOD-informed model bias adaptive sampling method, adjusting temperature scaling and sampling probabilities for fairer class representation.

Result: BOOST balances performance and fairness, reducing class-wise bias, validated on KaoKore and PACS datasets using the new SODC metric.

Conclusion: BOOST offers a robust solution for bias mitigation in AI art classification, ensuring equitable representation and improved fairness.

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with rule violations in trading systems, undermining player trust.

Method: State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) uses autonomous dialogue state inference and context-specific rules, breaking trading into six states with item referencing and price calculations.

Result: Achieves >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7% calculation precision in 100 dialogues.

Conclusion: SIBP outperforms baselines, offering a reliable foundation for trustworthy NPC interactions in games.

Abstract: Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with
rule-governed trading systems. Current implementations suffer from rule
violations, such as item hallucinations and calculation errors, that erode
player trust. Here, State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) enables reliable
trading through autonomous dialogue state inference and context-specific rule
adherence. The approach decomposes trading into six states within a unified
prompt framework, implementing context-aware item referencing and
placeholder-based price calculations. Evaluation across 100 trading dialogues
demonstrates >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7%
calculation precision. SIBP maintains computational efficiency while
outperforming baseline approaches, establishing a practical foundation for
trustworthy NPC interactions in commercial games.

### [5] [Neurosymbolic Feature Extraction for Identifying Forced Labor in Supply Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07217)
*Zili Wang,Frank Montabon,Kristin Yvonne Rozier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores neurosymbolic methods to detect illicit activities in supply chains using sparse, unreliable data, comparing manual and automated feature extraction from news articles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illicit activities in supply chains are hard to detect due to sparse, corrupted data, requiring new methods beyond traditional ML.

Method: Uses neurosymbolic techniques and a question tree approach with LLMs to classify and evaluate news articles on forced labor.

Result: Compares human and machine classification effectiveness in identifying illicit activities.

Conclusion: Proposes a systematic way to detect illicit supply chain activities without large datasets, leveraging LLMs for improved accuracy.

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient exploration is challenging in multi-agent reinforcement learning, and expert exploration is a promising approach to address this.

Method: The work investigates applying large-language models as expert planners for exploration in planning-based tasks involving multiple agents.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but the focus is on leveraging expert planners for improved exploration.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of large-language models to enhance exploration efficiency in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Efficient exploration is a well known problem in deep reinforcement learning
and this problem is exacerbated in multi-agent reinforcement learning due the
intrinsic complexities of such algorithms. There are several approaches to
efficiently explore an environment to learn to solve tasks by multi-agent
operating in that environment, of which, the idea of expert exploration is
investigated in this work. More specifically, this work investigates the
application of large-language models as expert planners for efficient
exploration in planning based tasks for multiple agents.

### [7] [ViDove: A Translation Agent System with Multimodal Context and Memory-Augmented Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07306)
*Yichen Lu,Wei Dai,Jiaen Liu,Ching Wing Kwok,Zongheng Wu,Xudong Xiao,Ao Sun,Sheng Fu,Jianyuan Zhan,Yian Wang,Takatomo Saito,Sicheng Lai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ViDove is a multimodal translation agent that improves translation quality by leveraging visual and contextual information, outperforming text-only LLM-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based translation agents are limited to text-only inputs, missing valuable visual and contextual cues for better translation.

Method: ViDove integrates multimodal memory, long-short term memory modules, and domain-specific knowledge to enhance translation.

Result: ViDove achieves a 28% BLEU score improvement and 15% SubER improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ViDove demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal inputs in translation, introducing DoveBench as a new benchmark for video subtitling and translation.

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

### [8] [On the Impossibility of Separating Intelligence from Judgment: The Computational Intractability of Filtering for AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07341)
*Sarah Ball,Greg Gluch,Shafi Goldwasser,Frauke Kreuter,Omer Reingold,Guy N. Rothblum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores computational challenges in filtering harmful content in LLMs, showing inefficiency in prompt and output filtering, and argues for integrating safety into LLM internals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about LLM misuse for harmful content by studying alignment challenges, focusing on filtering unsafe information.

Method: Analyzes prompt and output filtering, demonstrating computational challenges and adversarial prompt construction.

Result: Shows no efficient prompt filters exist for some LLMs and output filtering is computationally intractable under cryptographic assumptions.

Conclusion: Safety requires integrating filters into LLM internals; black-box access is insufficient, and intelligence cannot be separated from judgment.

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

### [9] [Supply Chain Optimization via Generative Simulation and Iterative Decision Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07355)
*Haoyue Bai,Haoyu Wang,Nanxu Gong,Xinyuan Wang,Wangyang Ying,Haifeng Chen,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sim-to-Dec framework integrates simulation and decision-making to optimize supply chain transportation, improving delivery rates and profit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for high responsiveness and economic efficiency in supply chain transportation by designing a robust and generalizable simulation-decision framework.

Method: Combines a generative simulation module (autoregressive modeling) with a dual-aware decision model, refined through end-to-end optimization.

Result: Significant improvements in timely delivery rates and profit across three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec effectively meets the requirements for a robust and generalizable transportation strategy framework.

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DrugMCTS integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repurposing, outperforming existing methods without domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of large language models in scientific reasoning beyond pretraining knowledge and address inefficiencies in conventional approaches like fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation.

Method: Proposes DrugMCTS, a framework combining RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search, using five specialized agents for structured reasoning.

Result: DrugMCTS outperforms Deepseek-R1 by over 20% and achieves higher recall and robustness on DrugBank and KIBA datasets compared to general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and feedback-driven search are crucial for advancing LLM applications in drug discovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

*Weihao Tan,Changjiu Jiang,Yu Duan,Mingcong Lei,Jiageng Li,Yitian Hong,Xinrun Wang,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StarDojo is a benchmark based on Stardew Valley to evaluate AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations, combining livelihood tasks and social interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack simultaneous evaluation of production and social skills in AI agents.

Method: StarDojo features 1,000 tasks across farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social interactions, with a subset of 100 tasks for efficiency. It offers a unified interface for easy evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4.1 achieve only a 12.7% success rate, highlighting limitations in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: StarDojo aims to advance research in robust, open-ended agents for complex production-living environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

TL;DR: AlgEval is a framework to study the algorithms LLMs learn and use, aiming to uncover algorithmic primitives and their composition for task-solving, with a case study on emergent search algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding the algorithms LLMs learn, as research focuses more on scaling for performance.

Method: Proposes AlgEval for systematic research, combining top-down hypotheses and bottom-up circuit-level analysis of attention and hidden states.

Result: Illustrates how LLMs form and use algorithms, providing a pathway to interpretability and more efficient training methods.

Conclusion: AlgEval offers a principled approach to understanding LLM computations, enabling interpretability and improved performance without relying solely on scaling.

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

*Mohamed Siala,Jordi Planes,Joao Marques-Silva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the rigor of explanations in rule-based ML models, highlighting issues like negative overlap and redundancy, and develops algorithms to analyze these problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the potential for misleading explanations in high-risk ML applications, especially with rule-based models.

Method: Develops algorithms to analyze negative overlap and redundancy in rule-based ML models.

Result: Finds that widely used tools for learning rule-based models often produce rule sets with negative facets.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for improved rigor in rule-based ML models to ensure reliable explanations.

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

*Zhixiang Su,Di Wang,Chunyan Miao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context Pooling, a novel method to enhance GNN-based models for link prediction in KGs, achieving SOTA performance in most settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla aggregation in GNNs for KG link prediction lacks impact; the paper aims to improve efficacy with query-specific graph generation.

Method: Proposes Context Pooling, using neighborhood precision and recall metrics to identify relevant neighbors for link prediction.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings on three public datasets.

Conclusion: Context Pooling is effective and generic, enhancing GNN-based models for KG link prediction.

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Motivation: To address uncertainty propagation in credal networks, specifically chains, by leveraging Dempster-Shafer theory for robust and efficient belief inference.

Method: Proposes a belief-based inference framework for chains, using belief and plausibility functions to compute conservative intervals, and compares it to sensitivity analysis.

Conclusion: The framework offers practical utility for belief inference in chains and broader credal networks, with insights into its effectiveness compared to classical approaches.

Abstract: This paper explores belief inference in credal networks using Dempster-Shafer
theory. By building on previous work, we propose a novel framework for
propagating uncertainty through a subclass of credal networks, namely chains.
The proposed approach efficiently yields conservative intervals through belief
and plausibility functions, combining computational speed with robust
uncertainty representation. Key contributions include formalizing belief-based
inference methods and comparing belief-based inference against classical
sensitivity analysis. Numerical results highlight the advantages and
limitations of applying belief inference within this framework, providing
insights into its practical utility for chains and for credal networks in
general.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve LLMs' ability to reason about spatial and geometric properties in structured indoor scenes.

Method: Uses symbolic representations (e.g., JSON, XML) of indoor scenes and diverse question types (metric, topological, design constraints) to test LLMs.

Result: LLMs perform well on shallow queries but struggle with physical constraints, spatial coherence, and generalization under layout changes.

Conclusion: PlanQA highlights a blind spot in LLMs' spatial reasoning, encouraging future work to enhance their capabilities in practical settings.

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

### [18] [Stable Preference Optimization for LLMs: A Bilevel Approach Beyond Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07723)
*Chengtao Jian,Kai Yang,Ye Ouyang,Xiaozhou Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing its sensitivity to initialization and tendency to misallocate probability mass, leading to unintended biases. It proposes a stable bilevel optimization framework to improve alignment with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO's empirical success lacks theoretical understanding, and its limitations (e.g., sensitivity to initialization and misallocation of probability mass) can compromise alignment stability and preference consistency.

Method: The authors propose a bilevel optimization framework integrating supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective, introducing regularization to ensure absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs.

Result: Experiments show the method improves reasoning accuracy and aligns output distributions better than standard DPO.

Conclusion: Stable preference optimization offers a more reliable and interpretable approach for aligning language models with human preferences.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

### [19] [Identification of Violin Reduction via Contour Lines Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07743)
*Philémon Beghin,Anne-Emmanuelle Ceulemans,François Glineur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to classify violins as reduced or non-reduced based on contour lines, using photogrammetry and geometric analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to quantitatively analyze the impact of size reductions on violins, a phenomenon observed by experts but not previously studied systematically.

Method: The method involves acquiring 3D geometric meshes of 25 violins via photogrammetry, extracting contour lines, fitting them to parabola-like curves, and computing features for classification.

Result: Classification based on geometry is feasible, with the opening parameter beta being the most predictive, though challenges remain for violins with intermediate transformations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of geometric analysis for classifying reduced violins, highlighting the importance of the opening parameter beta.

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

TL;DR: The FAI Benchmark evaluates AI alignment with human flourishing across seven dimensions, revealing gaps in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift AI evaluation from technical capabilities to holistic human well-being.

Method: Uses 1,229 questions, judge LLMs, and geometric mean scoring to assess AI performance across seven flourishing dimensions.

Result: Top models score 72/100, but none excel in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and Purpose.

Conclusion: The FAI Benchmark provides a framework for AI development focused on human flourishing, highlighting areas for improvement.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes MoSE, a skill-oriented Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model for autonomous driving, mimicking human learning and reasoning to improve performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of extensive training data and complex optimization in general MoE models, while improving generalization and interpretation in autonomous driving.

Method: Introduces a skill-oriented routing mechanism, hierarchical skill dataset, and pretrains the router for step-by-step reasoning, integrating auxiliary tasks efficiently.

Result: MoSE outperforms larger models (8B+ parameters) on CODA AD corner case reasoning with <3B sparsely activated parameters and reduces activated model size by 62.5%.

Conclusion: MoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance with computational efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of skill-oriented learning in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

### [22] [AI Should Sense Better, Not Just Scale Bigger: Adaptive Sensing as a Paradigm Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07820)
*Eunsu Baek,Keondo Park,Jeonggil Ko,Min-hwan Oh,Taesik Gong,Hyung-Sin Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for adaptive sensing in AI to reduce environmental and ethical costs, improve efficiency, and enable smaller models to outperform larger ones. It outlines a roadmap for integration and addresses challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI scaling methods are unsustainable and inequitable. Biological sensory systems inspire adaptive sensing as a solution.

Method: Proposes adaptive sensing to modulate sensor parameters at the input level, mitigating covariate shifts and improving efficiency.

Result: Empirical evidence shows adaptive sensing allows small models to outperform larger ones with less data and compute.

Conclusion: The paper calls for integrating adaptive sensing into AI systems for sustainability, robustness, and equity, proposing research directions.

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

### [23] [Searching for actual causes: Approximate algorithms with adjustable precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07857)
*Samuel Reyd,Ada Diaconescu,Jean-Louis Dessalles*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in explainable AI (XAI) by proposing polynomial-time algorithms to identify actual causes, catering to non-expert users' needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI and causality literature lacks formalization of actual causes, which non-expert users expect, and existing solutions are NP-complete or impractical.

Method: The authors introduce algorithms with polynomial complexity and adjustable precision to identify actual causes in non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems.

Result: Experiments show the algorithms handle diverse systems and trade precision for computation time.

Conclusion: The proposed methods bridge the gap in XAI by efficiently identifying actual causes, offering flexibility in precision and applicability.

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining prompt engineering and multidimensional knowledge graphs to enhance large language models for legal dispute analysis, improving accuracy and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models lack sufficient legal knowledge representation, concept understanding, and reasoning for legal analysis, necessitating an improved framework.

Method: A three-stage hierarchical prompt structure and three-layer knowledge graph architecture are introduced, with four methods for legal concept retrieval and web search integration.

Result: The framework significantly improves legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate application of law and nuanced understanding of judicial logic.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a novel technical solution for intelligent legal assistance systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

### [25] [Meek Models Shall Inherit the Earth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07931)
*Hans Gundlach,Jayson Lynch,Neil Thompson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead to convergence in AI model capabilities, reducing inequality. Meek models (limited compute) will approach the performance of top models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inequality in AI model performance due to compute scaling by showing diminishing returns will level the playing field.

Method: Develop a model illustrating shrinking marginal returns to compute under a fixed-distribution next-token objective. Analyze empirical data and theoretical performance models.

Result: Meek models will catch up to top models in performance due to diminishing returns. Empirical data supports this convergence.

Conclusion: AI strategy and policy need reevaluation as meek models' increasing capabilities shift the competitive landscape.

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how generative AI impacts work activities, identifying common tasks like information gathering and writing, and ranks occupations by AI applicability, with knowledge work roles scoring highest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the economic effects of generative AI by examining its real-world usage and impact on various occupations.

Method: Analysis of 200k anonymized user interactions with Microsoft Bing Copilot, classifying activities, measuring task success, and computing AI applicability scores for occupations.

Result: Highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work roles (e.g., computer/mathematical, administrative support) and sales. Insights into successful activities, wage/education correlations, and real-world vs. predicted impact.

Conclusion: Generative AI is most applicable to knowledge-intensive and communication-heavy occupations, with implications for workforce adaptation and economic planning.

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constructive approach for scaling LLMs using fixed embeddings, enabling modular composition and layer-wise growth, improving efficiency and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive and inflexible nature of monolithic LLM training by exploring a modular and incremental development approach.

Method: Utilizes non-trainable embeddings for modular composition (averaging logits of specialist models) and progressive layer-wise training of Transformers.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance on benchmarks like MMLU and SQuAD, with stable convergence and emergent complex reasoning.

Conclusion: Advocates a shift from monolithic to constructive AI development, enabling resource-efficient scaling and democratized model building.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FACap, a large-scale fashion-domain dataset for composed image retrieval (CIR), and FashionBLIP-2, a model fine-tuned for fashion-specific CIR, improving performance on fine-grained tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods struggle with fashion domains due to lack of domain-specific datasets and fine-grained understanding.

Method: FACap is created using web-sourced images and a two-stage annotation pipeline with VLMs and LLMs. FashionBLIP-2 fine-tunes BLIP-2 with lightweight adapters and multi-head matching.

Result: FashionBLIP-2, pretrained on FACap, significantly improves performance on fashion CIR tasks, especially for fine-grained modifications.

Conclusion: The approach addresses fashion CIR challenges effectively, demonstrating value for e-commerce applications.

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Autoeval-dmun is an automated tool using vision-language models to assess and improve unlearning in diffusion models, identifying nearby concept damage and adversarial prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine unlearning (MU) in diffusion models is cost-effective but challenging to verify and may harm surrounding concepts, raising deployment concerns.

Method: Autoeval-dmun leverages vision-language models to extract structured knowledge, identify damaged concepts, and test adversarial prompts for unlearning evaluation.

Result: Language models provide semantic orderings correlating with unlearning damage and effectively circumvent unlearning with adversarial prompts.

Conclusion: Autoeval-dmun offers a robust automated solution for evaluating and improving unlearning in diffusion models, ensuring better deployment readiness.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

*Francesco Ferrini,Veronica Lachi,Antonio Longa,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SP4LP combines GNN-based node encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths to improve link prediction by capturing multi-hop dependencies efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs struggle with link-specific structural patterns due to node-centric message-passing, and current methods are either computationally expensive or simplistic.

Method: SP4LP uses GNNs for node representations, extracts shortest paths between node pairs, and processes these paths with a sequence model.

Result: SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction benchmarks and is proven more expressive than standard GNNs.

Conclusion: SP4LP is a general, principled, and efficient approach for link prediction in graphs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores sparse adapters as an alternative to LoRA for modular architectures, showing they outperform LoRA and full fine-tuning in certain settings and scale well for merging multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate sparse adapters as a simpler, more effective alternative to LoRA for building modular architectures without additional fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes a simple method for training sparse adapters and tests their merging properties across 20 NLP tasks.

Result: Sparse adapters outperform LoRA and full fine-tuning in-distribution post-merging but struggle with held-out performance.

Conclusion: Sparse adapters are a promising alternative to LoRA for modular architectures, though challenges remain in generalizing to unseen tasks.

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

*Dongxiao He,Yongqi Huang,Jitao Zhao,Xiaobao Wang,Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Str-GCL integrates structural commonsense into Graph Contrastive Learning using first-order logic rules, improving representation learning without altering the original graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GCL methods overlook structural commonsense in graphs, missing crucial knowledge for effective representation learning.

Method: Str-GCL uses first-order logic rules to represent and integrate structural commonsense, employing topological and attribute-based rules with a representation alignment mechanism.

Result: Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL methods, demonstrating the value of structural commonsense in graph representation learning.

Conclusion: Str-GCL provides a novel approach to leveraging structural commonsense in GCL, offering improved performance and new insights.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

*Karthik Pappu,Prathamesh Dinesh Joshi,Raj Abhijit Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid physics-informed models (UDEs) outperform traditional and neural methods in malware propagation modeling, reducing prediction error by 44% and offering interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of malware propagation is crucial for cybersecurity defenses, especially against adaptive threats, but existing methods fail to capture nonlinear feedback mechanisms.

Method: Evaluated three approaches: classical ODEs, Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs, using data from the Code Red worm outbreak. Introduced symbolic recovery to transform neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions.

Result: UDE approach reduced prediction error by 44% compared to baselines, revealing suppression mechanisms like network saturation, security response, and malware evolution.

Conclusion: Hybrid models (physics-informed) provide better predictive accuracy and insights into malware dynamics, aiding early warning systems and targeted cyber defenses.

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

*Zhaojing Zhou,Xunchao Li,Minghao Li,Handi Zhang,Haoshuang Wang,Wenbin Chang,Yiqun Liu,Qingqing Dang,Dianhai Yu,Yanjun Ma,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CCQ is a novel quantization method for LLMs, compressing models to 2.0-2.75 bits with minimal accuracy loss, enabling efficient single-GPU deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs and deployment barriers of LLMs due to scaling, with existing sub-3-bit methods suffering accuracy and efficiency issues.

Method: CCQ combines hardware-aware bit-shift encoding, Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code Cluster to optimize inference while minimizing accuracy loss.

Result: CCQ compresses models like DeepSeek-V3 and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B significantly, enabling single-GPU deployment and open-sourcing the 2-bit model.

Conclusion: CCQ effectively addresses accuracy-speed trade-offs in low-bit quantization, making large LLMs more deployable and efficient.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

*Zixuan Huang,Kecheng Huang,Lihao Yin,Bowei He,Huiling Zhen,Mingxuan Yuan,Zili Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G-Guard, an attention-aware GNN-based classifier, defends against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs by constructing entity graphs and using attention-aware augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreak attacks, which are harder to detect than single-turn attacks.

Method: G-Guard builds entity graphs for multi-turn queries and uses attention-aware augmentation to retrieve similar single-turn queries for enhanced classification.

Result: G-Guard outperforms all baselines in evaluations across datasets and metrics.

Conclusion: G-Guard effectively mitigates multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs, improving safety.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

### [36] [Weighted Multi-Prompt Learning with Description-free Large Language Model Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07147)
*Sua Lee,Kyubum Shin,Jung Ho Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul), a method to distill LLM knowledge into prompts without extracting descriptions, improving robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using LLM-extracted descriptions for prompts suffer from variability and low reliability.

Method: DeMul directly distills LLM knowledge into prompts, avoiding descriptions, and uses continuous vectors for optimization. Multi-prompt weighting is introduced.

Result: Superior performance across 11 recognition datasets.

Conclusion: DeMul offers a more reliable and effective approach for prompt learning in VLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

*Huibo Xu,Runlong Yu,Likang Wu,Xianquan Wang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGFM improves time series forecasting by integrating auxiliary model errors and historical data, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of diffusion models in forecasting, such as rigid distributions and limited sampling paths, by leveraging flow matching's flexibility and untapped potential.

Method: Proposes Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM), which incorporates auxiliary model outputs, historical data, and constructs two-sided conditional probability paths using affine paths.

Result: CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms state-of-the-art models in forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: CGFM effectively advances forecasting methods by unlocking the potential of flow matching and learning from auxiliary model errors.

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

*Elia Piccoli,Malio Li,Giacomo Carfì,Vincenzo Lomonaco,Davide Bacciu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Weight Sharing Attention (WSA) to combine embeddings from multiple pre-trained models for Reinforcement Learning (RL), balancing efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL lacks prior knowledge and often relies on monolithic models. Combining pre-trained models' embeddings effectively remains understudied.

Method: Introduces WSA architecture to merge embeddings from multiple pre-trained models, creating enriched state representations.

Result: WSA achieves comparable performance to end-to-end models on Atari games and shows scalability with model numbers.

Conclusion: WSA effectively leverages pre-trained models in RL, offering a scalable and efficient solution.

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

### [39] [Scale leads to compositional generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07207)
*Florian Redhardt,Yassir Akram,Simon Schug*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks can generalize over compositional tasks with sufficient data and model scaling, but failures persist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if and how neural networks can capture discrete, compositional task structure despite their continuous nature.

Method: Scale data and model size, analyze task encodings, and prove theoretical bounds on network approximation.

Result: Scaling leads to compositional generalization; task constituents can be linearly decoded from hidden activations.

Conclusion: Neural networks can achieve compositional generalization with proper scaling and training coverage, but challenges remain.

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

*Yunyi Li,Maria De-Arteaga,Maytal Saar-Tsechansky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decoupled Confident Learning (DeCoLe), a machine learning framework to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, focusing on hate speech detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label bias causes systematic errors in data labels, impacting analysis quality across social groups. Despite its recognition, effective solutions are lacking.

Method: Proposes DeCoLe, a principled framework for bias-aware mislabeling detection, theoretically justified and empirically tested in hate speech detection.

Result: DeCoLe outperforms alternative methods in detecting label errors, demonstrating effectiveness in bias-aware mislabeling detection.

Conclusion: DeCoLe addresses label bias challenges and can enhance data reliability in organizational practices.

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

*Minchan Jeong,J. Jon Ryu,Se-Young Yun,Gregory W. Wornell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable method for learning the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator is proposed, avoiding unstable operations like SVD and matrix inversion, and showing effectiveness in tasks like eigen-analysis and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (e.g., VAMPnet, DPNet) for learning Koopman operator singular subspaces involve numerically unstable operations, leading to biased gradients and scalability issues.

Method: The proposed method uses low-rank approximation to learn the top-k singular functions, avoiding unstable linear algebraic operations and integrating with deep learning pipelines.

Result: Empirical results show the learned singular subspaces are reliable and effective for tasks like eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Conclusion: The new method offers a scalable and stable alternative for learning Koopman operator singular functions, improving performance in downstream tasks.

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

TL;DR: MUSE improves LLM uncertainty quantification by aggregating diverse model predictions using Jensen-Shannon Divergence, outperforming single-model and naive ensemble methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show inconsistent behavior, highlighting the need for better uncertainty quantification, especially in high-stakes scenarios. Prior work lacks focus on leveraging model diversity.

Method: Proposes MUSE, an information-theoretic method using Jensen-Shannon Divergence to aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs.

Result: Experiments show MUSE enhances calibration and predictive performance in binary tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MUSE effectively leverages model diversity for more reliable uncertainty estimates in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

*Erfan Hamdi,Emma Lejeune*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dataset for benchmarking ML in fracture mechanics is introduced, alongside baseline models (PINN, FNO, UNet), to address gaps in current overly simple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML approaches for fracture modeling rely on simplistic benchmarks, failing to capture the complexity of phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture.

Method: A challenging PFM-based dataset with 6,000 simulations (varying energy decompositions, boundary conditions, crack configurations) is created. Baseline models (PINN, FNO, UNet) are evaluated, including ensembling strategies.

Result: The dataset and baselines provide a standardized benchmark, revealing the promise and limitations of current ML models for fracture mechanics.

Conclusion: The work establishes a robust testbed for advancing ML in fracture mechanics, highlighting both progress and areas needing improvement.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks eight attention mechanisms for energy efficiency in training GPT-2, identifying optimized kernels like Flash Attention, LSH Attention, and MLA as the most efficient. It emphasizes the role of training time alongside GPU power in energy use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of rigorous evaluation on energy usage and hardware demands of efficient attention variants in LLMs and VLMs motivates this study.

Method: The authors benchmark eight attention mechanisms in GPT-2 training, measuring metrics like training time, GPU memory, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption.

Result: Optimized kernels (Flash Attention, LSH Attention, MLA) are most energy-efficient. Lower GPU power alone doesn't reduce energy use; training time is equally critical.

Conclusion: Energy-aware benchmarking is crucial for attention design, and the study offers practical insights for selecting resource-efficient mechanisms.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

*Giulio Rossolini,Fabio Brau,Alessandro Biondi,Battista Biggio,Giorgio Buttazzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights a security risk in partitioned deep learning models across IoT edge environments, showing how intercepted intermediate features can be exploited to craft transferable adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The distributed nature of partitioned deep learning models exposes new vulnerabilities, particularly through intermediate feature leakage, which adversaries can exploit even without direct access to model components.

Method: The authors propose an exploitation strategy involving statistical analysis to reconstruct tensor shapes from intercepted features and adapt surrogate models for effective adversarial attack transferability.

Result: Experiments show that surrogate models trained with intercepted features significantly improve the transferability of adversarial attacks, demonstrating the vulnerability of distributed systems.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need to address intermediate feature leakage in secure distributed deep learning system designs.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

TL;DR: Combining wearable IMU and contactless radar sensors improves food intake gesture detection, with a proposed robust multimodal framework (MM-TCN-CMA) handling missing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dietary monitoring by improving detection performance and addressing robustness in multimodal learning when one modality is missing.

Method: Proposes MM-TCN-CMA, a multimodal temporal convolutional network with cross-modal attention, integrating IMU and radar data. Tests on a new dataset of 52 meal sessions.

Result: Improves F1-score by 4.3% (vs. radar) and 5.2% (vs. IMU). Maintains performance with gains of 1.3% (missing radar) and 2.4% (missing IMU).

Conclusion: First robust multimodal framework for IMU-radar fusion in food intake detection, demonstrating improved performance and resilience to missing data.

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Motivation: The static ATE metric often fails to capture nuanced treatment effects in healthcare, necessitating a dynamic approach for better decision-making.

Result: Produces accurate, interpretable, and editable models of treatment dynamics, supporting rigorous analysis and practical decisions.

Conclusion: The framework enhances causal inference by providing dynamic, actionable insights into treatment effects, crucial for high-stakes domains.

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

*Aaron Foote,Danny Krizanc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIP is a test to detect unreliable permutation feature importance scores caused by model extrapolation, especially with dependent features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding feature importance in machine learning models is crucial, but permutation feature importance can be misleading with dependent features.

Method: Developed TRIP, a minimal-assumption test to detect unreliable permutation feature importance scores, and adapted it for high-dimensional settings.

Result: TRIP reliably detects when permutation feature importance scores are unreliable, as shown in simulations and applications.

Conclusion: TRIP provides a reliable way to assess the trustworthiness of permutation feature importance scores, addressing a key limitation in interpretability.

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProbNES enhances NES with Bayesian quadrature, outperforming NES and global methods like BO in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NES algorithms suffer from limited sample efficiency due to random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates.

Method: Introduces Probabilistic Natural Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), integrating Bayesian quadrature into NES.

Result: ProbNES consistently outperforms NES, BO, and πBO in benchmark functions, data-driven tasks, hyperparameter tuning, and locomotion.

Conclusion: ProbNES improves sample efficiency and performance, making it a superior choice for black-box optimization.

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

*Paola Causin,Alessio Marta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using Mixture of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Riemannian geometry to estimate intrinsic dimension, construct local coordinates, and learn mappings between ambient and manifold spaces, enhancing solutions to inverse problems like biomedical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, but leveraging this requires addressing intrinsic dimension estimation, local coordinate construction, and mapping learning.

Method: Uses Mixture of VAEs and Riemannian geometry to estimate intrinsic dimension via VAE decoder pullback metric, constructs an atlas of local charts, and enforces manifold constraints for inverse problems.

Result: The framework improves solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, and shows intrinsic dimension as a proxy for model capacity during pruning.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses manifold learning challenges and enhances inverse problem solutions, with intrinsic dimension aiding model capacity monitoring.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between theoretical operator learning and practical implementations, focusing on discretization independence for robust multifidelity learning.

Method: Develops a general encode-approximate-reconstruct model using neural bases, ensuring discretization independence and multifidelity capabilities. Theoretical and statistical guarantees are provided.

Result: Multifidelity training improves accuracy and efficiency, validated on PDE problems. Empirical results show enhanced discretization independence.

Conclusion: The model is the first to comprehensively link discretization independence with multifidelity operator learning, offering theoretical and practical advancements.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdeptHEQ-FL is a hybrid classical-quantum federated learning framework that improves model performance, privacy, and communication efficiency in non-IID settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-offs in FL between performance, privacy, and efficiency, especially in non-IID environments, while incorporating quantum enhancements.

Method: Combines a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture, adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation with differential privacy, selective homomorphic encryption, and dynamic layer-wise freezing.

Result: Achieves ≈25.43% and ≈14.17% higher accuracy than Standard-FedQNN and FHE-FedQNN on CIFAR-10, with reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: AdeptHEQ-FL is efficient and practical for privacy-preserving, resource-aware FL, balancing performance and overhead.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model
performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in
non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design
for FL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A secure and efficient clustered federated learning (CFL) design is proposed, optimizing resource allocation and user scheduling while incorporating differential privacy (DP). A novel DPVD-MARL algorithm improves convergence and rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in CFL, such as heterogeneous BS capabilities, non-IID user data, and limited wireless resources, while ensuring privacy and efficiency.

Method: A dynamic penalty function-assisted value-decomposed multi-agent reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm optimizes RB allocation, user scheduling, and DP noise.

Result: DPVD-MARL improves convergence rate by 20% and accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Conclusion: The proposed CFL framework with DPVD-MARL effectively balances privacy, efficiency, and performance in federated learning.

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cGAN-based framework to create stealthy adversarial attacks on UAV IDS and a CVAE-based method to detect them, outperforming traditional OOD detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IDS and OOD detectors fail to identify novel and stealthy adversarial threats, necessitating advanced methods.

Method: A cGAN crafts adversarial attacks, and a CVAE detects them using negative log-likelihood, compared to Mahalanobis distance.

Result: CVAE-based detection outperforms traditional methods in identifying stealthy adversarial threats.

Conclusion: Advanced probabilistic modeling is crucial for resilient IDS against generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deceptive signal-assisted private split learning method to protect model and data information from eavesdroppers, using a deep reinforcement learning framework with intrinsic curiosity and cross-attention modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent eavesdroppers from collecting sensitive model and data information during collaborative training among edge devices.

Method: A soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning framework with intrinsic curiosity and cross-attention (ICM-CA) is used to optimize device subsets for deceptive signals and model training, transmit power, and sub-model assignments.

Result: The method improves convergence rate by 3x and reduces information leakage by 13% compared to traditional SAC.

Conclusion: The proposed ICM-CA framework effectively enhances privacy protection and training efficiency in split learning scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the plausibility-validity gap in LLMs for chemistry by fine-tuning the Magistral Small model with LoRA and a dual-domain dataset, improving chemical validity and synthesis feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce plausible but invalid scientific information, especially in specialized domains like chemistry, necessitating a solution to bridge this gap.

Method: Fine-tuned the Magistral Small model using LoRA and a dual-domain dataset (molecular properties and chemical reactions) to enhance accuracy.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperformed the baseline in format adherence, chemical validity, and synthesis feasibility, though limitations like stereochemistry errors persist.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for adapting generalist LLMs into reliable chemical tools, identifying areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

TL;DR: A lightweight Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer is added to graph transformers to route nodes to suitable manifolds (spherical, flat, hyperbolic), improving accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph transformers blur heterogeneous topologies by embedding nodes in a single Euclidean space, lacking geometric awareness.

Method: Prepend a Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer to project nodes onto suitable manifolds (spherical, flat, hyperbolic) based on local structure.

Result: Accuracy improves by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware projection enhances predictive power and interpretability of graph representations.

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) and context sample enhancement (CSE) to improve generalization in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) when training on a single context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL policies often fail to generalize to environments with different parameters, and obtaining diverse training data is impractical.

Method: Proposes CEBE for better generalization and CSE as a data augmentation method to approximate CEBE.

Result: CEBE provides a first-order approximation to the Q-function, and CSE improves generalization in simulations.

Conclusion: CEBE and CSE offer promising solutions for enhancing DRL generalization with limited training contexts.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the statistical complexity of PU learning without assuming a known class prior, providing sample size bounds for positive and unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PU learning is important in real-world applications, but existing work relies on restrictive assumptions like known class priors or specific data distributions. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: Theoretical analysis of PU learning under varied setups, focusing on unknown class priors. Upper and lower bounds on sample sizes are derived.

Result: Proven bounds on required sample sizes for positively labeled and unlabeled data, without assuming prior knowledge of class proportions.

Conclusion: The study advances PU learning by relaxing assumptions and providing theoretical guarantees on sample complexity.

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

TL;DR: GO-CBED is a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for efficient causal experimental design, focusing on user-specified queries and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve causal experimental design by directly targeting user-specified causal quantities, avoiding the inefficiency of inferring full causal models.

Method: Uses a variational lower bound estimator with a transformer-based policy network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors for real-time decision-making.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in causal reasoning tasks, especially with limited budgets and complex mechanisms.

Conclusion: Aligning experimental design with specific goals and forward-looking planning enhances efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATHENA, a hierarchical graph neural network framework for personalized classification of subclinical atherosclerosis by integrating clinical and molecular data, improving classification performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack consistency in leveraging cohort-wide features and integrating shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients, limiting understanding of atherosclerotic trajectories.

Method: ATHENA constructs a hierarchical network representation through integrated modality learning, optimizing patient-specific molecular fingerprints while aligning with cohort-wide patterns.

Result: The framework improved classification performance by up to 13% in AUC and 20% in F1 score on a dataset of 391 patients.

Conclusion: ATHENA enhances personalized intervention strategies and disease progression prediction through explainable AI-driven subnetwork clustering.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper addresses reward hacking in RLHF by proposing a unified reward modeling framework combining BT single-objective and multi-objective regression, improving robustness and performance in OOD settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF's vulnerability to reward hacking and poor performance in OOD scenarios motivates the need for better reward modeling.

Method: A unified framework jointly trains BT single-objective and multi-objective regression-based reward functions using a shared embedding space.

Result: The framework enhances robustness and scoring performance, with a 7B model outperforming a 70B baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates reward hacking and improves reward model performance, especially in OOD settings.

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring

*Zesheng Liu,Maryam Rahnemoonfar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRIT, a graph transformer for ice layer thickness, improves prediction accuracy by combining geometric graph learning with attention mechanisms, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding ice layer thickness and variability in radar imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, evaluating ice dynamics, and reducing climate model uncertainties.

Method: GRIT integrates an inductive geometric graph learning framework with an attention mechanism to model relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers.

Result: GRIT achieves lower prediction errors than baseline graph neural networks, demonstrating the effectiveness of its attention mechanism and spatiotemporal modeling.

Conclusion: GRIT successfully combines transformer and graph neural network strengths for robust modeling of ice layer dynamics, offering improved accuracy in radar imagery analysis.

Abstract: Gaining a deeper understanding of the thickness and variability of internal
ice layers in Radar imagery is essential in monitoring the snow accumulation,
better evaluating ice dynamics processes, and minimizing uncertainties in
climate models. Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, capture detailed
radargram images of internal ice layers. In this work, we introduce GRIT, graph
transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric
graph learning framework with an attention mechanism, designed to map the
relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths
of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex
spatiotemporal dynamics.

TL;DR: ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer, improves ice layer thickness estimation in radargrams by leveraging attention mechanisms, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate measurement of ice layer thickness is vital for climate modeling and ice dynamics, but current methods lack robustness.

Method: ST-GRIT uses geometric graph learning and separate spatial/temporal attention blocks to model long-range dependencies in radargrams.

Result: ST-GRIT achieves lower root mean-squared error than state-of-the-art methods on Greenland ice sheet data.

Conclusion: ST-GRIT's attention mechanisms enhance noise handling, avoid oversmoothing, and improve long-range dependency modeling in ice layer analysis.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

*Seonghyun Park,Kiyoung Seong,Soojung Yang,Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli,Sungsoo Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TLC is a framework for learning collective variables (CVs) from time-lagged conditions of a generative model, improving rare event sampling in molecular dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare events in molecular dynamics are hard to observe due to long timescales; existing ML methods for CV discovery often miss detailed dynamics.

Method: TLC learns CVs by modeling time-lagged conditional distributions, not just static Boltzmann distributions.

Result: TLC outperforms existing ML methods in transition path sampling and state discrimination on the Alanine Dipeptide system.

Conclusion: TLC provides a dynamic and accurate approach for CV discovery in enhanced sampling tasks.

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GTED (Generalized Tree Edit Distance) is proposed as a novel evaluation framework for statement autoformalization, outperforming existing metrics in accuracy and Kappa scores on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for autoformalization lack semantic understanding, have high computational costs, and are limited by automated theorem proving progress.

Method: GTED standardizes formal statements, converts them into operator trees, and uses the GTED metric to determine semantic similarity.

Result: GTED achieves the highest accuracy and Kappa scores on miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: GTED provides a more faithful metric for automated evaluation of statement autoformalization.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental
results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

### [67] [HGMP:Heterogeneous Graph Multi-Task Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07405)
*Pengfei Jiao,Jialong Ni,Di Jin,Xuan Guo,Huan Liu,Hongjiang Chen,Yanxian Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HGMP, a multi-task prompt framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing pre-training and downstream task mismatch with unified task reformulation, contrastive pre-training, and feature prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the mismatch between pre-trained models and downstream tasks in heterogeneous graph neural networks, and improve performance using prompt learning.

Method: Proposes HGMP: 1) unifies downstream tasks into graph-level format, 2) designs graph-level contrastive pre-training, and 3) introduces heterogeneous feature prompts.

Result: HGMP outperforms baselines on public datasets, adapting well to various tasks.

Conclusion: HGMP effectively bridges the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks, enhancing performance in heterogeneous graph scenarios.

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

*Paul M. Riechers,Thomas J. Elliott,Adam S. Shai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks pretrained on next-token prediction inherently represent beliefs over low-dimensional generative models of their data, akin to performing Bayesian updates. This capability is unique to neural networks and not replicable by finite classical circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how neural networks, like transformers and RNNs, naturally discover and represent beliefs over generative models of their training data during inference.

Method: Pretraining neural networks on next-token prediction and analyzing their representations of low-dimensional generative models.

Result: Neural networks intrinsically represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' models, with geometric relationships among activations being architecture-independent.

Conclusion: Neural networks uniquely capture and update beliefs over generative models, a capability beyond classical circuits, with implications for understanding their inference mechanisms.

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

*Wooseong Jeong,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DTME-MTL improves multi-task learning by dynamically adapting token space to mitigate negative transfer, avoiding excessive parameter growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negative transfer in multi-task learning degrades performance; fixed transformer architectures limit adaptability.

Method: DTME-MTL identifies gradient conflicts in token space and applies adaptive solutions without duplicating parameters.

Result: DTME-MTL enhances multi-task performance efficiently with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: DTME-MTL offers a scalable and effective solution for transformer-based multi-task learning.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

TL;DR: General-purpose models (GPMs) like large language models show promise in addressing the challenges of diverse, small, and fuzzy datasets in chemical sciences, despite being in early stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical sciences face unique challenges with diverse, small, and fuzzy datasets, which are hard to leverage using conventional machine learning.

Method: The paper reviews the fundamental principles of GPMs and their recent applications in chemical sciences.

Result: GPMs demonstrate potential to solve untrained tasks and work flexibly with low data, though many applications are still prototypes.

Conclusion: GPMs are expected to mature and become more impactful in chemical sciences in the near future.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

*Berkant Turan,Suhrab Asadulla,David Steinmann,Wolfgang Stammer,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a framework combining Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) and Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for interpretable, nonlinear classification in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PVGs lack application to complex inputs like images, while CBMs are limited by linear predictors. NCV aims to bridge this gap.

Method: NCV uses minimally supervised concept discovery for structured encodings, a prover selects subsets, and a nonlinear verifier makes decisions.

Result: NCV outperforms CBM and pixel-based PVG baselines on complex datasets and reduces shortcut behavior.

Conclusion: NCV is a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer model, improves Parkinson's Disease detection from EEG data by addressing inter-subject variability, achieving higher accuracy and consistency compared to other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG-based DL models for Parkinson's Disease detection suffer from poor generalizability due to high inter-subject variability, necessitating better architectures.

Method: TransformEEG combines depthwise convolutional tokenization with transformer encoders to enhance feature mixing. Evaluated using a 10-outer, 10-inner N-LNSO cross-validation on four datasets (290 subjects).

Result: TransformEEG achieved the highest median balanced accuracy (78.45%) and lowest variability (6.37%). With augmentation and correction, accuracy improved to 80.10% (5.74% variability).

Conclusion: TransformEEG provides more reliable and consistent Parkinson's Disease detection, reducing variability and outperforming other models.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

*Joris Suurmeijer,Ivo Pascal de Jong,Matias Valdenegro-Toro,Andreea Ioana Sburlea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares uncertainty quantification in BCI classifiers, finding CSP-LDA and MDRM-T provide the best uncertainty estimates, while Deep Ensembles and CNNs offer superior classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and improve uncertainty quantification in BCI classifiers, addressing overconfidence in Deep Learning and underconfidence in traditional methods.

Method: Comparison of CSP-LDA, MDRM, Deep Ensembles, Direct Uncertainty Quantification, and CNNs for uncertainty estimation and classification in Motor Imagery BCIs.

Result: CSP-LDA and MDRM-T excel in uncertainty estimates; Deep Ensembles and CNNs perform best in classification. All models distinguish easy/difficult samples, enabling accuracy improvement by rejecting ambiguous samples.

Conclusion: Traditional methods (CSP-LDA, MDRM-T) outperform Deep Learning in uncertainty quantification, while Deep Learning excels in classification. Combining these strengths can enhance BCI accuracy.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

TL;DR: The paper addresses shallow forgetting in machine unlearning, proposes a 'deep forgetting' criterion, and introduces the One-Point-Contraction (OPC) algorithm for robust unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements, machine unlearning must ensure deep forgetting, not just superficial adjustments.

Method: Defines deep forgetting via one-point-contraction of feature representations and proposes the OPC algorithm for efficient unlearning.

Result: OPC achieves effective unlearning and resists performance recovery and gradient-inversion attacks.

Conclusion: OPC's deep feature forgetting highlights the need for robust unlearning methods.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

TL;DR: S4T synchronizes multiple tasks during test-time training to address domain shifts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTT methods fail to align adaptation steps for multiple tasks under domain shifts.

Method: Proposes S4T, which predicts task relations to synchronize tasks during test-time training.

Result: S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods on multi-task benchmarks.

Conclusion: S4T effectively handles multi-task scenarios under domain shifts by synchronizing tasks.

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

TL;DR: DAD is a real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for multivariate time series, offering efficient single-pass processing and superior performance in high-dimensional data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for real-time anomaly detection in high-dimensional data streams, like IoT, drives the development of methods that minimize memory usage and enable fast decision-making.

Method: DAD uses an online decorrelation learning approach to dynamically monitor data correlations sample by sample, avoiding the need for storing historical data.

Result: DAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse anomaly types and is robust to increasing dimensionality.

Conclusion: DAD sets a new standard for real-time anomaly detection by balancing efficacy and efficiency, especially in memory-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of theoretical convergence guarantees for natural-gradient descent in variational inference, even for simple cases. It proposes a square-root parameterization for Gaussian covariance to establish new convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide theoretical convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference, which is often effective but lacks such guarantees.

Method: The method involves using a square-root parameterization for the Gaussian covariance to analyze convergence in natural-gradient descent and its continuous-time gradient flow.

Result: The results show novel convergence guarantees for natural-gradient methods, which outperform Euclidean or Wasserstein-based algorithms in experiments.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed square-root parameterization successfully establishes convergence guarantees, validating the practical effectiveness of natural-gradient methods.

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a stable, inversion-free framework for context-aware low-rank approximation in neural networks, addressing numerical instabilities and memory issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical instabilities due to reliance on explicit Gram matrix computation and inversion, degrading approximation quality.

Method: Introduces a novel inversion-free regularized framework based on stable decompositions, handling GPU memory limits, near-singular matrices, and insufficient data.

Result: The method overcomes numerical pitfalls, handles challenging scenarios, and provides convergence guarantees with error bounds for insufficient data cases.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves stability and performance in context-aware low-rank approximation for neural networks.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

Motivation: Existing pruning methods underutilize fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD or parallel compute, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: UnIT dynamically skips MAC operations using input-specific activation patterns, replaces multiplications with threshold checks, and optimizes compute with reused thresholds and sensitivity-based pruning.

Result: UnIT achieves 11.02-82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30-84.19% faster inference, and 27.33-84.38% lower energy use while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: UnIT is a practical, retraining-free solution for efficient DNN deployment on MCUs, even under domain shift.

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

*Michail Kalntis,Fernando A. Kuipers,George Iosifidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning framework optimizes conditional handovers (CHOs) in cellular networks, outperforming 3GPP benchmarks by 180% in volatile conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional handovers face delays and failures in complex networks; CHOs improve success but introduce resource and signaling challenges.

Method: Proposes a meta-learning framework aligned with O-RAN for CHO optimization, ensuring dynamic regret guarantees.

Result: Demonstrates 180% better performance than 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses CHO challenges, enhancing performance in dynamic cellular networks.

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

### [81] [Agentic Retrieval of Topics and Insights from Earnings Calls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07906)
*Anant Gupta,Rajarshi Bhowmik,Geoffrey Gunow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an LLM-agent driven method to dynamically extract and structure emerging topics from earnings calls, improving financial trend analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic modeling fails to adapt to evolving industries and capture emerging topics dynamically.

Method: Uses an LLM-agent to extract topics, structure them hierarchically, and relate new topics to existing ones via a topic ontology.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in inferring company insights and tracking emerging trends, evaluated through ontology coherence and trend accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach enhances financial analysis by dynamically capturing and organizing emerging topics from earnings calls.

Abstract: Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings
calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve,
traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging
topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven
approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings
calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them
into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

*Iago Xabier Vázquez García,Damla Partanaz,Emrullah Fatih Yetkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a BERT-based clustering pipeline for mapping O*NET occupations, evaluates dimensionality reduction, and improves results with a specialized silhouette approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occupational definitions vary across firms/countries, necessitating a mapping mechanism for O*NET data expansion.

Method: Uses BERT-based techniques with clustering approaches and examines dimensionality reduction effects.

Result: Improved clustering performance with specialized silhouette approach.

Conclusion: The approach aids automatic occupation distinction, supporting career transitions.

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

### [83] [Low Resource Reconstruction Attacks Through Benign Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07947)
*Sol Yarkoni,Roi Livni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new low-resource attack method identifies benign prompts that unintentionally reconstruct training images from generative models, highlighting privacy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and copyright concerns in generative models by demonstrating how easily training data can be reconstructed without high resources or direct access.

Method: Leverages domain knowledge and templated prompts from scraped e-commerce data to identify vulnerabilities, enabling image reconstruction with seemingly harmless prompts.

Result: Shows that even uninformed users can unintentionally reconstruct real-life images (e.g., a human face from a T-shirt prompt).

Conclusion: Reveals a fundamental vulnerability in generative models using scraped data, emphasizing the need for better data stewardship and model safeguards.

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

*Arpana Sinhal,Anay Sinhal,Amit Sinhal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a multimodal dataset and advanced machine learning models to improve real-time stress monitoring for healthcare workers, addressing gaps in existing research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare workers, especially nurses, face high occupational stress, worsened by COVID-19. Wearable sensors for stress monitoring lack comprehensive datasets and robust frameworks.

Method: The study uses a multimodal dataset (physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate, skin temperature) and applies SMOTE for class balance. It evaluates Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP, and a Stacking Classifier.

Result: The work advances deployable stress-monitoring systems, offering practical solutions for healthcare workers' mental health.

Conclusion: Future research should expand demographic diversity and explore edge-computing for low-latency stress alerts.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-chunking improves RL for long-horizon tasks by leveraging offline data and action chunking for better exploration and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in offline-to-online RL, particularly exploration and sample efficiency, by utilizing offline data effectively.

Method: Applies action chunking to TD-based RL, enabling temporally consistent behaviors and unbiased n-step backups.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in offline performance and online sample efficiency on sparse-reward tasks.

Conclusion: Q-chunking is a simple, effective solution for improving RL in long-horizon, sparse-reward settings.

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

*Sebastian Lotter,Elisabeth Mohr,Andrina Rutsch,Lukas Brand,Francesca Ronchi,Laura Díaz-Marugán*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using synthetic molecular communication (SMC) via the gut-brain axis (GBA) for personalized healthcare, leveraging machine learning to improve therapeutic modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GBA modulation treatments for neurological diseases are standardized but ineffective for many patients due to unknown molecular pathways. Personalized approaches are needed.

Method: The study defines theoretical requirements for GBA modulation and uses a machine learning model to verify these with limited data, evaluating its accuracy on datasets.

Result: The model accurately identifies GBA modulators and specific pathways crucial for therapeutic modulation.

Conclusion: Personalized GBA modulation using SMC and machine learning offers a promising, data-driven approach to improve treatment efficacy.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

### [87] [EXPO: Stable Reinforcement Learning with Expressive Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07986)
*Perry Dong,Qiyang Li,Dorsa Sadigh,Chelsea Finn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EXPO improves sample efficiency in online RL by using an expressive base policy and a lightweight Gaussian edit policy to maximize Q-value, avoiding direct optimization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies in online RL is challenging due to unstable gradient propagation.

Method: Proposes Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), which combines a stable imitation-trained base policy and a Gaussian edit policy to maximize value.

Result: EXPO achieves 2-3x better sample efficiency compared to prior methods in fine-tuning and leveraging offline data.

Conclusion: EXPO effectively addresses stable value maximization for expressive policies, enhancing online RL performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FL methods are unsustainable for IoT in Society 5.0 due to high resource demands.

Conclusion: SParSeFuL bridges the gap between FL and sustainability in IoT.

Abstract: Federated Learning offers privacy-preserving collaborative intelligence but
struggles to meet the sustainability demands of emerging IoT ecosystems
necessary for Society 5.0-a human-centered technological future balancing
social advancement with environmental responsibility. The excessive
communication bandwidth and computational resources required by traditional FL
approaches make them environmentally unsustainable at scale, creating a
fundamental conflict with green AI principles as billions of
resource-constrained devices attempt to participate. To this end, we introduce
Sparse Proximity-based Self-Federated Learning (SParSeFuL), a resource-aware
approach that bridges this gap by combining aggregate computing for
self-organization with neural network sparsification to reduce energy and
bandwidth consumption.

*Junyu Luo,Yuhao Tang,Yiwei Fu,Xiao Luo,Zhizhuo Kou,Zhiping Xiao,Wei Ju,Wentao Zhang,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLOGAN introduces sparse causal modeling and generative intervention for stable graph domain adaptation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UGDA methods struggle with causal-spurious feature entanglement and global alignment failures, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: SLOGAN uses sparse causal modeling, mutual information bottleneck constraints, and generative intervention for feature disentanglement and domain adaptation.

Result: SLOGAN achieves superior performance on real-world datasets compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SLOGAN effectively addresses UGDA challenges through causal feature disentanglement and dynamic intervention, ensuring stable transfer learning.

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decentralized architecture combining Federated Split Learning (FSL) with Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) addresses privacy and scalability issues in collaborative machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional Federated Learning (centralized risks) and Split Learning (scalability issues) in sensitive domains.

Method: Integrates FSL with HLF, using chaincode for decentralized orchestration, transient fields, and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to ensure privacy and scalability.

Result: Matches centralized FSL accuracy on CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks, with reduced training time and minimal blockchain overhead.

Conclusion: The HLF-FSL approach is viable for enterprise deployment, offering privacy, scalability, and performance.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

*Darshan Makwana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the layerwise effective dimension (rank) in finite-width ReLU networks, deriving closed-form expressions for expected rank and showing geometric decay of rank deficit. It identifies revival depths with local maxima and contrasts behavior under different initializations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how random ReLU layers affect the subspace of input variations and provide nuanced insights into deep network expressivity.

Method: Analyzes the rank of hidden activation matrices for fixed input batches with random Gaussian weights, deriving closed-form expressions and proving concentration bounds.

Result: Expected rank deficit decays geometrically, with revival depths showing local maxima. Oscillatory rank behavior is a finite-width phenomenon, absent under orthogonal initialization or leaky-ReLU.

Conclusion: The study precisely characterizes rank dynamics in ReLU networks, revealing alternating collapse and revival of input subspaces, enriching prior expressivity work.

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

TL;DR: FedCBDR addresses class imbalance in Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) via a class-wise balancing data replay method and task-aware temperature scaling, improving accuracy by 2%-15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in FCIL limits performance due to limited global awareness and imbalance between replayed and new classes.

Method: FedCBDR uses a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights learning objectives. It includes a global-perspective data replay module and task-aware temperature scaling.

Result: FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling and improves generalization, yielding 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FedCBDR effectively mitigates class imbalance in FCIL, enhancing performance and generalization.

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GuardVal, a dynamic evaluation protocol for jailbreak attacks on LLMs, addressing gaps in current benchmarks and offering insights into model vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to fully assess LLM vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks, necessitating a more robust evaluation method.

Method: GuardVal dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's state, coupled with an optimization method to avoid stagnation.

Result: Applied to models like Mistral-7b and GPT-4, GuardVal reveals distinct behavioral patterns and deeper vulnerabilities across 10 safety domains.

Conclusion: GuardVal provides a comprehensive assessment of LLM robustness, offering insights for future research and more secure model development.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-task neural network method for estimating distributional treatment effects (DTE) outperforms conventional ATE-focused approaches, addressing data imbalance and computational inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DTE offers granular insights into experiment outcomes, but current regression methods struggle with precision in distribution tails and computational demands.

Method: Uses multi-task neural networks with monotonic constraints and multi-threshold label learning to estimate conditional outcome distributions.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on simulated and real-world datasets, including water conservation and streaming platform experiments.

Conclusion: Proposed method is robust and practical for causal inference, especially for understanding treatment effect heterogeneity.

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

*Tejaswini Medi,Steffen Jung,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIX is a feature-aware adversarial training framework that adaptively assigns adversaries to classes based on their vulnerability, improving fairness and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods treat all classes uniformly, leading to unfair robustness where some classes remain vulnerable. TRIX addresses this by adapting training based on class-wise vulnerabilities.

Method: TRIX assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes and stronger untargeted adversaries to weak classes. It also uses per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments.

Result: TRIX improves worst-case class accuracy on clean and adversarial data, reduces inter-class robustness disparities, and maintains overall accuracy.

Conclusion: TRIX is a practical solution for fair and effective adversarial defense, addressing class-wise vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

### [96] [BEAVER: Building Environments with Assessable Variation for Evaluating Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07769)
*Ruohong Liu,Jack Umenberger,Yize Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the scalability and generalization challenges of RL in building energy management, proposing a multi-objective contextual RL framework and benchmarking its performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the lack of scalability and generalization in RL-based building energy management across diverse environments and objectives.

Method: Formalizes the multi-objective contextual RL problem, parameterizes contextual information, and constructs a benchmark for evaluating generalizable RL algorithms.

Result: Existing multi-objective RL methods achieve reasonable trade-offs but degrade under certain environmental variations, highlighting the need for dynamics-dependent contextual information.

Conclusion: Incorporating contextual information is crucial for improving RL policy generalization in building energy management.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

*Hermann Klein,Max Heinz Herkersdorf,Oliver Nelles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a space-filling regularization method to improve state space data distribution, enhancing training, interpretability, and robustness in nonlinear system identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor data coverage in state space due to trajectory deformations hinders training and interpretability, especially in local model networks.

Method: Proposes data-distribution-based penalty techniques for state trajectories in local affine state space models, integrating modeling and design of experiments.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on a benchmark system, showing improved data distribution and interpretability.

Conclusion: The new regularization method addresses state space deformation issues, benefiting training and interpretability in nonlinear systems.

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

*Alba Garrido,Alejandro Almodóvar,Patricia A. Apellániz,Juan Parras,Santiago Zazo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAMVAE, a multimodal deep learning framework, integrates six data modalities for improved survival prediction in oncology, outperforming traditional single-modality methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional survival prediction methods in oncology often use a single data modality, limiting their ability to capture tumor complexity. SAMVAE addresses this by integrating multiple data sources.

Method: SAMVAE uses modality-specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space, enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality-specific information. It handles both standard survival analysis and competing risks scenarios.

Result: SAMVAE achieves competitive performance on breast cancer and lower-grade glioma cohorts, successfully integrating multimodal data for accurate survival predictions.

Conclusion: SAMVAE establishes a foundation for interpretable, data-driven survival analysis in oncology, enhancing clinical decision-making with patient-specific insights.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

TL;DR: A novel local Lipschitz bound for transformer self-attention blocks is introduced, improving accuracy and revealing the impact of attention score maps. A regularization term, JaSMin, is proposed to enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding and robustness of transformers by refining the Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks and introducing a regularization method.

Method: Develop a refined closed-form expression for the spectral norm of the softmax function to derive a more accurate Lipschitz bound. Introduce JaSMin, a lightweight regularization term.

Result: The new Lipschitz bound is more accurate and reveals the influence of attention score maps. JaSMin enhances robustness and reduces local Lipschitz constants.

Conclusion: The refined Lipschitz bound and JaSMin regularization improve transformer robustness and provide insights into attention map effects.

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

TL;DR: The paper introduces data-dependent Bernstein inequalities for vector-valued processes in Hilbert space, applicable to stationary and non-stationary processes, improving estimation by leveraging correlation decay. It demonstrates their utility in covariance operator estimation and operator learning, achieving novel risk bounds, and validates them numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data in statistical learning.

Method: Introduces data-dependent Bernstein inequalities for vector-valued processes in Hilbert space, exploiting correlation decay.

Result: Novel risk bounds for covariance operator estimation and operator learning in dynamical systems, validated by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed inequalities effectively improve estimation in non-i.i.d. settings, with practical implications demonstrated in numerical experiments.

Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a
persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce
data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary
processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between
temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating text into tabular data pipelines and benchmarks state-of-the-art foundation models for handling textual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for tabular data lack textual columns, and real-world datasets with rich text features are hard to find.

Method: Proposes ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into tabular pipelines and curates real-world datasets with meaningful text features.

Result: Benchmarks how advanced tabular foundation models perform with textual data.

Conclusion: The study advances benchmarking for tabular foundation models with text.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

*Giovanni Dispoto,Paolo Bonetti,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel algorithm extracts interpretable policies (e.g., linear) from expert behavior in DRL, balancing performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of interpretability in DRL, which hinders deployment in mission-critical applications.

Method: Uses the advantage function to train interpretable policies from collected experience, unlike prior works.

Result: Empirical validation on control environments and financial trading shows meaningful policy extraction.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between performance and interpretability in DRL.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

*Haichen Hu,David Simchi-Levi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how pre-trained AI models for imputing missing covariates affect regret in sequential decision-making, introducing 'model elasticity' to quantify this impact. It also shows how calibration under MAR improves imputation quality and regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of pre-trained AI models on regret in sequential decision-making with missing covariates and improve their integration.

Method: Introduces 'model elasticity' to measure reward sensitivity to imputation errors and uses orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression for model calibration under MAR.

Result: Demonstrates that calibration improves imputation quality and regret guarantees, emphasizing the value of accurate pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Model elasticity is a key metric for integrating pre-trained models in decision-making, with calibration under MAR enhancing performance.

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A GNN-based framework for SME credit risk analysis, outperforming traditional methods with high AUC scores, aiding regulators and stress testers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMEs lack sufficient credit data, especially for online lenders, necessitating innovative methods like GNNs to leverage transaction and social data.

Method: Uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze SME interactions from transaction and social data, mapping spatial dependencies for default risk prediction.

Result: Achieves AUCs of 0.995 (supply chain) and 0.701 (default prediction), outperforming baselines. Helps model supply chain disruptions and aids regulatory stress tests.

Conclusion: The GNN framework is a scalable, effective tool for SME credit risk assessment, benefiting lenders and regulators.

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,
yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for
online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from
transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan
default risks. Tests on real-world datasets from Discover and Ant Credit (23.4M
nodes for supply chain analysis, 8.6M for default prediction) show the GNN
surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for
supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps
regulators model supply chain disruption impacts on banks, accurately
forecasting loan defaults from material shortages, and offers Federal Reserve
stress testers key data for CCAR risk buffers. This approach provides a
scalable, effective tool for assessing SME credit risk.

TL;DR: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) connects Savage's loss functions and stochastic choice theories, supporting abstention, non-convex objectives, and extensions like margins and length corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding DPO's general principles is crucial due to its wide applications, current momentum, and the need to navigate pitfalls in its variations.

Method: Establishes a connection between Savage's loss functions and stochastic choice theories, generalizing DPO to include abstention, non-convex objectives, and extensions.

Result: The framework covers notable DPO extensions and highlights pitfalls of deviating from the established map.

Conclusion: DPO's generalized perspective aids in understanding its diverse applications and avoiding pitfalls in variations.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

*Tianang Leng,Fangping Wan,Marcelo Der Torossian Torres,Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ApexOracle is an AI model that predicts antibiotic potency and designs new molecules to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR), outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AMR and the slow pace of antibiotic development necessitate faster, more effective solutions to identify and design antibiotics for emerging pathogens.

Method: ApexOracle integrates molecular features via a diffusion language model and a dual-embedding framework combining genomic and literature data for pathogen-specific context.

Result: It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in activity prediction and reliably transfers to novel pathogens, even with minimal data. It also generates effective new molecules.

Conclusion: ApexOracle provides a scalable solution to AMR by combining rapid prediction and targeted molecular design, aiding future outbreak preparedness.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

established simple heuristics for identifying high-quality co-folding

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAMO integrates sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) into multi-task learning (MTL) to mitigate task conflicts efficiently using global-local perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task conflicts in MTL hinder performance, and SAM shows promise in addressing this. However, integrating SAM into MTL faces challenges in combining global and local information and computational overhead.

Method: Proposes SAMO, a lightweight approach using joint global-local perturbations with approximated local perturbations via forward passes and layerwise normalization.

Result: Extensive experiments show SAMO's effectiveness and efficiency in MTL benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAMO successfully addresses task conflicts in MTL with a computationally efficient method.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

*Sukjun Hwang,Brandon Wang,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces H-Net, a hierarchical model that replaces traditional tokenization with dynamic chunking, outperforming token-based Transformers and improving robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization remains a barrier to true end-to-end language models. The goal is to eliminate pre-processing steps by learning segmentation strategies jointly with the model.

Method: H-Net uses dynamic chunking and hierarchical layers to learn context-dependent segmentation, replacing tokenization with a single end-to-end model.

Result: H-Net outperforms token-based Transformers, scales better with data, and shows improved robustness, especially in languages with weak tokenization heuristics.

Conclusion: H-Net demonstrates the potential of end-to-end models by learning directly from raw data, improving efficiency and performance across languages and modalities.

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

TL;DR: Prospective learning improves PAC framework by addressing dynamic data and evolving goals, with extensions to sequential decision-making like foraging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAC learning fails with dynamic data and changing objectives, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Extends prospective learning framework, improving algorithms and numerical results, and applies it to sequential decision-making (foraging).

Result: Preliminary results show improved performance in dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: Prospective learning offers a promising alternative to PAC for dynamic environments, with potential applications in sequential tasks.

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

Motivation: To explore if pretrained LLMs can adapt their architecture dynamically for different inputs without finetuning, improving efficiency for simple tasks and performance for challenging ones.

Method: Manipulate pretrained LLM layers as modular components, using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to find optimal layer compositions (CoLa) per sample.

Result: CoLa improves inference efficiency (shorter paths for 75% correct predictions) and performance (corrects 60% of originally wrong predictions).

Conclusion: Fixed LLM architectures are suboptimal; dynamic depth adaptation (CoLa) unlocks better generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.
