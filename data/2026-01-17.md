### [1] [AI Survival Stories: a Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09765)
*Herman Cappelen,Simon Goldstein,John Hawthorne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Develops a framework for AI existential risk analysis using a two-premise argument: AI becomes extremely powerful, and then destroys humanity. Creates taxonomy of survival stories where one premise fails, identifies challenges, connects to policy responses, and estimates P(doom).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a structured analytical framework for evaluating AI existential risk arguments, moving beyond polarized debates to systematic assessment of different scenarios where humanity might survive or be destroyed by AI.

Method: The method involves constructing a taxonomy of 'survival stories' based on analyzing which of the two premises fails: premise 1 (AI becomes extremely powerful) or premise 2 (extremely powerful AI destroys humanity). Each survival story is examined for its specific challenges.

Result: Develops a taxonomy of survival scenarios where humanity survives, identifies different challenges for each scenario, connects different survival stories to appropriate policy responses, and produces rough estimates of P(doom) - the probability AI destroys humanity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the debate about AI existential risk can be systematically analyzed through the two-premise framework, which helps identify specific challenges for each survival scenario and estimate the probability of AI-caused destruction.

Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT, there has been a lot of debate about whether AI systems pose an existential risk to humanity. This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI. Finally, we use our taxonomy to produce rough estimates of P(doom), the probability that humanity will be destroyed by AI.

### [2] [GUI-Eyes: Tool-Augmented Perception for Visual Grounding in GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09770)
*Chen Chen,Jiawei Shao,Dakuan Lu,Haoyi Hu,Xiangcheng Liu,Hantao Yao,Wu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-Eyes is an RL framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks, using a two-stage reasoning process and a spatially continuous reward function to improve grounding accuracy with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models and reinforcement learning methods for GUI automation rely on static, one-shot visual inputs and passive perception, lacking the ability to adaptively determine when, whether, and how to observe the interface. This limits their effectiveness in dynamic GUI environments where adaptive observation is crucial.

Method: The method involves a reinforcement learning framework with active visual perception. It uses a two-stage reasoning process where the agent learns strategic decisions on whether and how to invoke visual tools (e.g., cropping, zooming). A progressive perception strategy decomposes decision-making into coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding, coordinated by a two-level policy. A spatially continuous reward function is designed to integrate location proximity and region overlap for dense supervision.

Result: On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming both supervised and RL-based baselines.

Conclusion: The GUI-Eyes framework demonstrates that tool-aware active perception, enabled by a two-stage reasoning process and a spatially continuous reward function, is critical for building robust and data-efficient GUI agents. The approach significantly outperforms existing supervised and RL-based baselines, showing that adaptive visual observation strategies can greatly improve grounding accuracy in GUI automation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) have driven progress in GUI automation. However, most existing methods rely on static, one-shot visual inputs and passive perception, lacking the ability to adaptively determine when, whether, and how to observe the interface. We present GUI-Eyes, a reinforcement learning framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks. To acquire more informative observations, the agent learns to make strategic decisions on both whether and how to invoke visual tools, such as cropping or zooming, within a two-stage reasoning process. To support this behavior, we introduce a progressive perception strategy that decomposes decision-making into coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding, coordinated by a two-level policy. In addition, we design a spatially continuous reward function tailored to tool usage, which integrates both location proximity and region overlap to provide dense supervision and alleviate the reward sparsity common in GUI environments. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming both supervised and RL-based baselines. These results highlight that tool-aware active perception, enabled by staged policy reasoning and fine-grained reward feedback, is critical for building robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

### [3] [PCN-Rec: Agentic Proof-Carrying Negotiation for Reliable Governance-Constrained Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09771)
*Aradhya Dixit,Shreem Dixit*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PCN-Rec is a proof-carrying negotiation pipeline that separates natural-language reasoning from deterministic enforcement to ensure LLM-based recommenders reliably satisfy governance constraints like diversity and long-tail exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM-based recommenders can generate compelling ranked lists but struggle to reliably satisfy governance constraints such as minimum long-tail exposure or diversity requirements.

Method: PCN-Rec uses a base recommender to produce candidate windows, then employs two agents (User Advocate optimizing relevance and Policy Agent enforcing constraints) with a mediator LLM to synthesize top-N slates with structured certificates. A deterministic verifier checks constraint satisfaction, and if verification fails, a constrained-greedy repair produces compliant slates for re-verification.

Result: On MovieLens-100K with governance constraints, PCN-Rec achieves 98.55% pass rate on feasible users versus a one-shot single-LLM baseline without verification/repair, while preserving utility with only a 0.021 absolute drop in NDCG@10 (0.403 vs. 0.424), with statistically significant differences.

Conclusion: PCN-Rec effectively separates reasoning from enforcement to create auditable, constraint-satisfying recommender systems that maintain utility while reliably meeting governance requirements.

Abstract: Modern LLM-based recommenders can generate compelling ranked lists, but they struggle to reliably satisfy governance constraints such as minimum long-tail exposure or diversity requirements. We present PCN-Rec, a proof-carrying negotiation pipeline that separates natural-language reasoning from deterministic enforcement. A base recommender (MF/CF) produces a candidate window of size W, which is negotiated by two agents: a User Advocate optimizing relevance and a Policy Agent enforcing constraints. A mediator LLM synthesizes a top-N slate together with a structured certificate (JSON) describing the claimed constraint satisfaction. A deterministic verifier recomputes all constraints from the slate and accepts only verifier-checked certificates; if verification fails, a deterministic constrained-greedy repair produces a compliant slate for re-verification, yielding an auditable trace. On MovieLens-100K with governance constraints, PCN-Rec achieves a 98.55% pass rate on feasible users (n = 551, W = 80) versus a one-shot single-LLM baseline without verification/repair, while preserving utility with only a 0.021 absolute drop in NDCG@10 (0.403 vs. 0.424); differences are statistically significant (p < 0.05).

### [4] [Antisocial behavior towards large language model users: experimental evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09772)
*Paweł Niszczota,Cassandra Grützner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: People punish AI users financially; punishment increases with actual LLM use, and disclosure creates suspicion about 'no use' claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether negative attitudes toward AI users translate into costly punitive actions, addressing the gap in understanding social reactions to LLM use beyond self-reported disapproval.

Method: A two-phase online experiment where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce earnings of peers who completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support, examining punishment based on actual vs. self-reported LLM use.

Result: Participants destroyed 36% of earnings of those relying exclusively on LLMs; punishment increased with actual LLM use; disclosure created a credibility gap where self-reported null use was punished more than actual null use, while high actual use was punished more than reported use.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that social disapproval of LLM use extends to costly punitive behavior, with actual LLM reliance triggering higher punishment than reported reliance, indicating a credibility gap and suggesting that efficiency gains from LLMs come at the cost of social sanctions.

Abstract: The rapid spread of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the social reactions they provoke. Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of "no use" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance. Taken together, these findings provide the first behavioral evidence that the efficiency gains of LLMs come at the cost of social sanctions.

### [5] [Improving Chain-of-Thought for Logical Reasoning via Attention-Aware Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09805)
*Nguyen Minh Phuong,Dang Huu Tien,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI) is a non-interactive framework that improves LLM logical reasoning by identifying and modulating attention heads with logical patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current logical reasoning approaches rely on complex interactive frameworks or external resources, introducing overhead and scalability limitations. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework that enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself is needed.

Method: Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI) - an inference-time intervention method that identifies and reweights attention heads exhibiting logical reasoning patterns, enabling model steering via attention modulation.

Result: Extensive experiments show AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: AAI provides an effective and computationally efficient non-interactive framework for enhancing logical reasoning in LLMs by modulating attention heads, offering better generalization without external resources.

Abstract: Modern logical reasoning with LLMs primarily relies on employing complex interactive frameworks that decompose the reasoning process into subtasks solved through carefully designed prompts or requiring external resources (e.g., symbolic solvers) to exploit their strong logical structures. While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

### [6] [M^4olGen: Multi-Agent, Multi-Stage Molecular Generation under Precise Multi-Property Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10131)
*Yizhan Li,Florence Cloutier,Sifan Wu,Ali Parviz,Boris Knyazev,Yan Zhang,Glen Berseth,Bang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MolGen is a two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints using fragment-level reasoning and RL optimization, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating molecules with precise multi-property constraints is challenging, as LLMs struggle with precise numeric reasoning and multi-objective control without external structure and feedback.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage approach: Stage I involves prototype generation with a multi-agent reasoner performing retrieval-anchored fragment-level edits, while Stage II uses RL-based fine-grained optimization with Group Relative Policy Optimization for one- or multi-hop refinements.

Result: Experiments on two sets of property constraints show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their MolGen framework represents a significant advancement in multi-property constrained molecule generation, providing a more systematic approach to addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.

### [7] [Thinking Long, but Short: Stable Sequential Test-Time Scaling for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09855)
*Michael R. Metel,Yufei Cui,Boxing Chen,Prasanna Parthasarathi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Min-Seek is a novel sequential test-time scaling method that stabilizes reasoning model accuracy across extended reasoning lengths without requiring fine-tuning, uses efficient KV cache management, and enables reasoning beyond context limits with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While sequential test-time scaling shows promise for improving large reasoning model accuracy, current implementations have significant limitations. Extending reasoning length can increase accuracy initially but eventually leads to degradation and model instability. The need for reasoning length fine-tuning and computational inefficiency are additional drawbacks that need to be addressed.

Method: The paper introduces Min-Seek, a novel sequential test-time scaling method that improves accuracy by inducing models to think longer. It uses a custom KV cache that stores keys without position embeddings, dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought. The method is efficient as it only keeps KV pairs of one additional induced thought in the KV cache during reasoning.

Result: Min-Seek significantly improves model accuracy over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizes the accuracy of sequential scaling, eliminates the need for reasoning length fine-tuning, enables reasoning beyond a model's maximum context length, and achieves linear computational complexity under mild conditions.

Conclusion: The Min-Seek method presents an efficient, stable approach to sequential test-time scaling that significantly improves reasoning model accuracy across various tasks without requiring reasoning length fine-tuning, and enables reasoning beyond maximum context length with linear computational complexity.

Abstract: Sequential test-time scaling is a promising training-free method to improve large reasoning model accuracy, but as currently implemented, significant limitations have been observed. Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.

### [8] [Generative AI collective behavior needs an interactionist paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10567)
*Laura Ferrarotti,Gian Maria Campedelli,Roberto Dessì,Andrea Baronchelli,Giovanni Iacca,Kathleen M. Carley,Alex Pentland,Joel Z. Leibo,James Evans,Bruno Lepri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based multi-agent systems require new theoretical and methodological approaches to understand collective behavior, risks, and benefits due to their pre-trained knowledge and social priors interacting with social contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the collective behavior of agents based on large language models is essential due to important societal implications in terms of risks and benefits. LLMs' distinctive features—pre-trained knowledge, implicit social priors, and adaptation through in-context learning—create unique dynamics that require systematic study.

Method: The paper argues for adopting an interactionist paradigm consisting of alternative theoretical foundations, methodologies, and analytical tools to systematically examine how prior knowledge and embedded values interact with social context in LLM collectives.

Result: The article identifies that current paradigms are insufficient for studying LLM-based collectives and proposes four crucial directions for advancing this field through theoretical, methodological, and interdisciplinary approaches.

Conclusion: The article concludes by proposing four key directions for the development and deployment of LLM-based collectives, emphasizing the need for theory, methods, and trans-disciplinary dialogue to address the complex sociotechnical challenges of understanding LLM collectives.

Abstract: In this article, we argue that understanding the collective behavior of agents based on large language models (LLMs) is an essential area of inquiry, with important implications in terms of risks and benefits, impacting us as a society at many levels. We claim that the distinctive nature of LLMs--namely, their initialization with extensive pre-trained knowledge and implicit social priors, together with their capability of adaptation through in-context learning--motivates the need for an interactionist paradigm consisting of alternative theoretical foundations, methodologies, and analytical tools, in order to systematically examine how prior knowledge and embedded values interact with social context to shape emergent phenomena in multi-agent generative AI systems. We propose and discuss four directions that we consider crucial for the development and deployment of LLM-based collectives, focusing on theory, methods, and trans-disciplinary dialogue.

### [9] [A Scoping Review of the Ethical Perspectives on Anthropomorphising Large Language Model-Based Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09869)
*Andrea Ferrario,Rasita Vinay,Matteo Casserini,Alessandro Facchini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A scoping review mapping ethically oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based conversational agents, identifying definitional convergence but operational divergence, risk-focused evaluations, and gaps in linking effects to governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmentation of literature on anthropomorphisation in LLM-based conversational agents, with varying definitions, operationalizations, and normative evaluations, and to provide a systematic mapping of ethically oriented work on the topic.

Method: Scoping review methodology across five databases and three preprint repositories, synthesizing conceptual foundations, ethical challenges/opportunities, and methodological approaches.

Result: Found convergence on attribution-based definitions but substantial divergence in operationalization, a predominantly risk-forward normative framing, and limited empirical work linking observed interaction effects to actionable governance guidance.

Conclusion: The authors conclude with a research agenda and design/governance recommendations for ethically deploying anthropomorphic cues in LLM-based conversational agents, highlighting the need for better operationalization and governance guidance.

Abstract: Anthropomorphisation -- the phenomenon whereby non-human entities are ascribed human-like qualities -- has become increasingly salient with the rise of large language model (LLM)-based conversational agents (CAs). Unlike earlier chatbots, LLM-based CAs routinely generate interactional and linguistic cues, such as first-person self-reference, epistemic and affective expressions that empirical work shows can increase engagement. On the other hand, anthropomorphisation raises ethical concerns, including deception, overreliance, and exploitative relationship framing, while some authors argue that anthropomorphic interaction may support autonomy, well-being, and inclusion. Despite increasing interest in the phenomenon, literature remains fragmented across domains and varies substantially in how it defines, operationalizes, and normatively evaluates anthropomorphisation. This scoping review maps ethically oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs across five databases and three preprint repositories. We synthesize (1) conceptual foundations, (2) ethical challenges and opportunities, and (3) methodological approaches. We find convergence on attribution-based definitions but substantial divergence in operationalization, a predominantly risk-forward normative framing, and limited empirical work that links observed interaction effects to actionable governance guidance. We conclude with a research agenda and design/governance recommendations for ethically deploying anthropomorphic cues in LLM-based conversational agents.

### [10] [Epistemology gives a Future to Complementarity in Human-AI Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09871)
*Andrea Ferrario,Alessandro Facchini,Juan M. Durán*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reframing human-AI complementarity using epistemology to address theoretical challenges and position it as evidence of reliable epistemic processes rather than just predictive accuracy


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-AI complementarity lacks precise theoretical foundation, is limited to post hoc accuracy indicators, ignores other interaction desiderata, and overlooks the magnitude-cost profile of performance gains, making it difficult to obtain empirically

Method: Leveraging epistemology and computational reliabilism to analyze complementarity as evidence of reliable epistemic processes in human-AI interactions

Result: Complementarity functions as evidence that a human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process, which together with other reliability indicators supports practical reasoning by stakeholders affected by AI predictions

Conclusion: Complementarity should be reframed from a measure of relative predictive accuracy to an indicator of reliability in human-AI epistemic processes, helping stakeholders calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported systems.

Abstract: Human-AI complementarity is the claim that a human supported by an AI system can outperform either alone in a decision-making process. Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.

### [11] [Beyond Rule-Based Workflows: An Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agents Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent Communication from CORAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09883)
*Xinxing Ren,Quagmire Zang,Caelum Forder,Suman Deb,Ahsen Tahir,Roman J. Georgio,Peter Carroll,Zekun Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CORAL introduces an information-flow-orchestrated multi-agent system that uses dynamic natural language coordination instead of predefined workflows, achieving 63.64% accuracy on GAIA benchmark - 8.49 points higher than rule-based OWL baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems rely on predefined workflows that require substantial manual effort to anticipate task states and cannot exhaustively cover complex real-world task spaces, limiting their flexibility and scalability.

Method: A dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents using the A2A toolkit through natural language communication, eliminating the need for predefined workflows.

Result: On the GAIA benchmark with pass@1 setting, the proposed method achieved 63.64% accuracy, outperforming the workflow-based OWL baseline (55.15%) by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption, while enabling more flexible task monitoring and robust edge case handling.

Conclusion: CORAL's information-flow-orchestrated multi-agent paradigm through A2A communication represents a significant advancement over rule-based MAS by enabling dynamic, natural language coordination without predefined workflows, demonstrating superior performance and flexibility in complex task environments.

Abstract: Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) rely on predefined workflows, where human engineers enumerate task states in advance and specify routing rules and contextual injections accordingly. Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption. Further case-level analysis shows that our paradigm enables more flexible task monitoring and more robust handling of edge cases. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Beyond-Rule-Based-Workflows

### [12] [Continuum Memory Architectures for Long-Horizon LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09913)
*Joe Logan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Continuum Memory Architecture (CMA) as a persistent, stateful alternative to stateless RAG for LLM agents, showing empirical advantages on memory-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) treats memory as a stateless lookup table with information persisting indefinitely, read-only retrieval, and no temporal continuity, which limits long-term agent capabilities.

Method: The paper defines CMA as a class of systems with specific architectural requirements including persistent storage, selective retention, associative routing, temporal chaining, and consolidation into higher-order abstractions.

Result: Empirical probes (knowledge updates, temporal association, associative recall, contextual disambiguation) demonstrate consistent behavioral advantages over RAG on tasks requiring memory accumulation, mutation, and disambiguation.

Conclusion: The Continuum Memory Architecture (CMA) represents a necessary architectural primitive for long-horizon agents, addressing fundamental limitations of standard RAG systems by providing persistent, mutable memory with temporal awareness.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the default strategy for providing large language model (LLM) agents with contextual knowledge. Yet RAG treats memory as a stateless lookup table: information persists indefinitely, retrieval is read-only, and temporal continuity is absent. We define the \textit{Continuum Memory Architecture} (CMA), a class of systems that maintain and update internal state across interactions through persistent storage, selective retention, associative routing, temporal chaining, and consolidation into higher-order abstractions. Rather than disclosing implementation specifics, we specify the architectural requirements CMA imposes and show consistent behavioral advantages on tasks that expose RAG's structural inability to accumulate, mutate, or disambiguate memory. The empirical probes (knowledge updates, temporal association, associative recall, contextual disambiguation) demonstrate that CMA is a necessary architectural primitive for long-horizon agents while highlighting open challenges around latency, drift, and interpretability.

*Hanna Foerster,Robert Mullins,Tom Blanchard,Nicolas Papernot,Kristina Nikolić,Florian Tramèr,Ilia Shumailov,Cheng Zhang,Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Single-Shot Planning for Computer Use Agents enables secure architectural isolation by generating a complete execution graph upfront, preventing prompt injection attacks while maintaining performance, though Branch Steering attacks remain a concern.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious content hijacks agent behavior to steal credentials or cause financial loss. The only known robust defense is architectural isolation, but applying this to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) is challenging because they require continuous observation of UI state, which conflicts with the isolation needed for security. The authors aim to resolve this tension.

Method: The authors introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content. This provides provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. The method is evaluated on OSWorld.

Result: The design retains up to 57% of the performance of frontier models while improving performance for smaller open-source models by up to 19% on OSWorld. It prevents instruction injection attacks but requires additional measures to prevent Branch Steering attacks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that rigorous security and utility can coexist in Computer Use Agents (CUAs) through Single-Shot Planning with architectural isolation, which successfully prevents instruction injection attacks while maintaining reasonable performance. However, additional measures are needed to counter Branch Steering attacks, which exploit UI element manipulation to trigger unintended valid paths.

Abstract: AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious content hijacks agent behavior to steal credentials or cause financial loss. The only known robust defense is architectural isolation that strictly separates trusted task planning from untrusted environment observations. However, applying this design to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) -- systems that automate tasks by viewing screens and executing actions -- presents a fundamental challenge: current agents require continuous observation of UI state to determine each action, conflicting with the isolation required for security. We resolve this tension by demonstrating that UI workflows, while dynamic, are structurally predictable. We introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan. We evaluate our design on OSWorld, and retain up to 57% of the performance of frontier models while improving performance for smaller open-source models by up to 19%, demonstrating that rigorous security and utility can coexist in CUAs.

TL;DR: Proposes a systematic framework to manage hallucinations in LLMs/LRMs for high-stakes applications through root cause analysis, multi-faceted detection, and stratified mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs and LRMs have transformative potential for high-stakes domains like finance and law, but their tendency to hallucinate poses critical reliability risks that must be addressed for trustworthy deployment.

Method: A comprehensive operational framework built on a continuous improvement cycle with root cause awareness, integrating multi-faceted detection methods (uncertainty estimation, reasoning consistency) with stratified mitigation strategies (knowledge grounding, confidence calibration). Demonstrated through a tiered architecture and financial data extraction case study.

Result: Development of a hallucination management framework that categorizes hallucination sources into model, data, and context-related factors, and demonstrates application through a tiered architecture with a financial data extraction case study.

Conclusion: The operational framework for hallucination management provides a systematic, scalable methodology for building trustworthy generative AI systems in regulated environments, establishing a foundation for future research in reliability assurance for LLMs/LRMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) offer transformative potential for high-stakes domains like finance and law, but their tendency to hallucinate, generating factually incorrect or unsupported content, poses a critical reliability risk. This paper introduces a comprehensive operational framework for hallucination management, built on a continuous improvement cycle driven by root cause awareness. We categorize hallucination sources into model, data, and context-related factors, allowing targeted interventions over generic fixes. The framework integrates multi-faceted detection methods (e.g., uncertainty estimation, reasoning consistency) with stratified mitigation strategies (e.g., knowledge grounding, confidence calibration). We demonstrate its application through a tiered architecture and a financial data extraction case study, where model, context, and data tiers form a closed feedback loop for progressive reliability enhancement. This approach provides a systematic, scalable methodology for building trustworthy generative AI systems in regulated environments.

Conclusion: LabourLawLLM outperforms general-purpose and existing legal-specific LLMs, and the methodology provides a scalable approach for building specialized LLMs in other legal subfields to improve legal AI applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in domain-specific applications, particularly within the legal domain. However, general-purpose models such as GPT-4 often struggle with specialized subdomains that require precise legal knowledge, complex reasoning, and contextual sensitivity. To address these limitations, we present LabourLawLLM, a legal large language model tailored to Chinese labor law. We also introduce LabourLawBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse labor-law tasks, including legal provision citation, knowledge-based question answering, case classification, compensation computation, named entity recognition, and legal case analysis. Our evaluation framework combines objective metrics (e.g., ROUGE-L, accuracy, F1, and soft-F1) with subjective assessment based on GPT-4 scoring. Experiments show that LabourLawLLM consistently outperforms general-purpose and existing legal-specific LLMs across task categories. Beyond labor law, our methodology provides a scalable approach for building specialized LLMs in other legal subfields, improving accuracy, reliability, and societal value of legal AI applications.

### [16] [SPRInG: Continual LLM Personalization via Selective Parametric Adaptation and Retrieval-Interpolated Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09974)
*Seoyeon Kim,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPRInG is a novel semi-parametric framework for continual personalization of LLMs that uses drift-driven selective adaptation to handle evolving user preferences without catastrophic forgetting, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalization methods for Large Language Models assume static user preferences, but real-world interactions involve dynamic, evolving interests. Standard continual learning approaches struggle with noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts, leading to catastrophic forgetting and poor adaptation.

Method: SPRInG employs a semi-parametric framework with drift-driven selective adaptation during training, using a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions. It selectively updates a user-specific adapter on drift signals while preserving residuals in a replay buffer. During inference, it applies strict relevance gating and fuses parametric knowledge with retrieved history via logit interpolation.

Result: Experiments on the long-form personalized generation benchmark show that SPRInG outperforms existing baselines, validating its robustness for real-world continual personalization.

Conclusion: SPRInG effectively addresses the challenge of continual personalization in dynamic user preference environments by combining selective adaptation with replay buffers and logit interpolation, leading to robust performance that outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: Personalizing Large Language Models typically relies on static retrieval or one-time adaptation, assuming user preferences remain invariant over time. However, real-world interactions are dynamic, where user interests continuously evolve, posing a challenge for models to adapt to preference drift without catastrophic forgetting. Standard continual learning approaches often struggle in this context, as they indiscriminately update on noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts. To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization. During training, SPRInG employs drift-driven selective adaptation, which utilizes a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions. This allows the model to selectively update the user-specific adapter on drift signals while preserving hard-to-learn residuals in a replay buffer. During inference, we apply strict relevance gating and fuse parametric knowledge with retrieved history via logit interpolation. Experiments on the long-form personalized generation benchmark demonstrate that SPRInG outperforms existing baselines, validating its robustness for real-world continual personalization.

*Zerui Yang,Weichuan Wang,Yanwei Xu,Linqi Song,Yudai Matsuda,Wei Han,Bo Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo-SQL is a training-free NL2SQL framework that uses structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction with dynamic memory to improve robustness and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art results on BIRD with significantly reduced resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL2SQL systems have two main limitations: (1) they use only correct examples for in-context learning, ignoring valuable signals from error-fix pairs that could enhance self-correction; (2) test-time scaling often results in arbitrary question decomposition, leading to similar SQL candidates across runs and poor ensemble gains. Additionally, these methods face a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The framework employs structured decomposition (entity-wise, hierarchical, atomic sequential) and experience-aware self-correction with a dynamic memory of successful queries and error-fix pairs. It uses retrieval-augmented prompting to incorporate relevant examples at inference time without fine-tuning or external APIs.

Result: On the BIRD benchmark, Memo-SQL achieves 68.5% execution accuracy, establishing a new state of the art among open, zero-fine-tuning methods. It also uses over 10 times fewer resources compared to prior test-time scaling approaches.

Conclusion: Memo-SQL is an effective training-free framework that addresses key limitations in existing NL2SQL systems by introducing structured decomposition for diverse reasoning and experience-aware self-correction using dynamic memory. It achieves state-of-the-art results with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: Existing NL2SQL systems face two critical limitations: (1) they rely on in-context learning with only correct examples, overlooking the rich signal in historical error-fix pairs that could guide more robust self-correction; and (2) test-time scaling approaches often decompose questions arbitrarily, producing near-identical SQL candidates across runs and diminishing ensemble gains. Moreover, these methods suffer from a stark accuracy-efficiency trade-off: high performance demands excessive computation, while fast variants compromise quality. We present Memo-SQL, a training-free framework that addresses these issues through two simple ideas: structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction. Instead of leaving decomposition to chance, we apply three clear strategies, entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential, to encourage diverse reasoning. For correction, we build a dynamic memory of both successful queries and historical error-fix pairs, and use retrieval-augmented prompting to bring relevant examples into context at inference time, no fine-tuning or external APIs required. On BIRD, Memo-SQL achieves 68.5% execution accuracy, setting a new state of the art among open, zero-fine-tuning methods, while using over 10 times fewer resources than prior TTS approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for modeling LLM personality using Jungian types enables nuanced, adaptable expression via coordination, adaptation, and evolution mechanisms, improving naturalistic agent design in HCI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in HCI, but existing approaches often fail to achieve both nuanced and adaptable personality expression, which is critical for influencing engagement, decision-making, and perceived realism.

Method: The framework models LLM personality via Jungian psychological types using three mechanisms: dominant-auxiliary coordination for core expression, reinforcement-compensation for temporary adaptation, and reflection for long-term evolution. Personality alignment is evaluated using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaires and tested under diverse challenge scenarios.

Result: The framework allows agents to maintain nuanced traits while dynamically adjusting to interaction demands and gradually updating underlying structure, supporting coherent, context-sensitive interactions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables LLMs to maintain nuanced personality traits while dynamically adapting to context, supporting more naturalistic and coherent agent design in HCI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping human-computer interaction (HCI), from personalized assistants to social simulations. Beyond language competence, researchers are exploring whether LLMs can exhibit human-like characteristics that influence engagement, decision-making, and perceived realism. Personality, in particular, is critical, yet existing approaches often struggle to achieve both nuanced and adaptable expression. We present a framework that models LLM personality via Jungian psychological types, integrating three mechanisms: a dominant-auxiliary coordination mechanism for coherent core expression, a reinforcement-compensation mechanism for temporary adaptation to context, and a reflection mechanism that drives long-term personality evolution. This design allows the agent to maintain nuanced traits while dynamically adjusting to interaction demands and gradually updating its underlying structure. Personality alignment is evaluated using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaires and tested under diverse challenge scenarios as a preliminary structured assessment. Findings suggest that evolving, personality-aware LLMs can support coherent, context-sensitive interactions, enabling naturalistic agent design in HCI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaperScout: adaptive agent for academic paper search using sequential decision-making, trained with PSPO to address multi-turn RL optimization challenges. Outperforms existing methods in recall and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing paper search approaches rely on rigid, predefined workflows that struggle with complex conditional queries. Training autonomous agents for such multi-turn tasks is challenging due to granularity mismatch between token-level optimization in standard RL and sequence-level agent-environment interactions, leading to noisy credit assignment.

Method: 1) PaperScout: an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as sequential decision-making, dynamically deciding when/how to invoke search and expand tools based on context. 2) Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO): a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent-environment interaction.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance.

Conclusion: PaperScout with PSPO represents a paradigm shift from rigid workflows to adaptive agentic paper search, with PSPO addressing the fundamental optimization challenge in multi-turn agent training.

Abstract: Academic paper search is a fundamental task in scientific research, yet most existing approaches rely on rigid, predefined workflows that struggle with complex, conditional queries. To address this limitation, we propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as a sequential decision-making process. Unlike static workflows, PaperScout dynamically decides whether, when, and how to invoke search and expand tools based on accumulated retrieval context. However, training such agents presents a fundamental challenge: standard reinforcement learning methods, typically designed for single-turn tasks, suffer from a granularity mismatch when applied to multi-turn agentic tasks, where token-level optimization diverges from the granularity of sequence-level interactions, leading to noisy credit assignment. We introduce Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO), a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent-environment interaction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance, validating the effectiveness of our adaptive agentic framework and optimization strategy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FilDeep is a multi-fidelity DL framework that solves the data quantity-accuracy dilemma in large deformation problems by simultaneously training with both low and high-fidelity data, achieving SOTA performance for elastic-plastic solids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods for large deformations in elastic-plastic solids have limitations, while current DL methods require high-quantity, high-accuracy datasets that are difficult to obtain. There's a dilemma between data quantity and accuracy in large deformation problems, leading to suboptimal DL model performance.

Method: Proposes FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework using both low-fidelity (high quantity, low accuracy) and high-fidelity (low quantity, high accuracy) data simultaneously. Includes attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to capture long-range physical interactions across multi-fidelity data, with meticulous designs for practical large deformation applications like stretch bending.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that FilDeep consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be efficiently deployed in manufacturing applications. The framework effectively resolves the quantity-accuracy dilemma.

Conclusion: FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using multi-fidelity data, successfully resolving the quantity-accuracy dilemma through cross-fidelity modules and demonstrating superior performance and practical deployment capability.

Abstract: The scientific computation of large deformations in elastic-plastic solids is crucial in various manufacturing applications. Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FilDeep consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be efficiently deployed in manufacturing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of 100+ trillion tokens from real-world LLM usage reveals rapid adoption of reasoning models like o1, surprising popularity of creative roleplay and coding tasks, and a "Glass Slipper" effect where early users show much higher retention than later adopters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid shift from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference in LLMs (marked by o1's release), there's a gap in understanding how these models are actually being used in practice. The paper aims to provide empirical insights into real-world LLM usage patterns.

Method: Leveraged the OpenRouter platform, an AI inference provider, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. Conducted empirical study of usage patterns, adoption trends, and retention analysis.

Result: Found substantial adoption of open-weight models, surprising popularity of creative roleplay (beyond expected productivity tasks) and coding assistance, rise of agentic inference, and identified a "Cinderella Glass Slipper" effect where early users show much higher long-term engagement than later cohorts.

Conclusion: Real-world LLM usage is complex and multifaceted, with surprising patterns that challenge common assumptions. These data-driven insights can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers.

Abstract: The past year has marked a turning point in the evolution and real-world use of large language models (LLMs). With the release of the first widely adopted reasoning model, o1, on December 5th, 2024, the field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference, accelerating deployment, experimentation, and new classes of applications. As this shift unfolded at a rapid pace, our empirical understanding of how these models have actually been used in practice has lagged behind. In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella "Glass Slipper" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs "in the wild" is complex and multifaceted. We discuss implications for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers, and outline how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems.

TL;DR: MatrixCoT introduces structured Chain-of-Thought with matrix-based planning and verification to enhance LLMs' logical reasoning without external solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CoT prompting falls short on logical reasoning requiring symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules, while neuro-symbolic methods suffer from format sensitivity and parsing brittleness of external solvers.

Method: Normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, use matrix-based planning to preserve global relations, and implement feedback-driven replanning for verification under semantic-equivalence constraints.

Result: Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks with five LLMs show enhanced robustness and interpretability while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: MatrixCoT enhances logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs by providing structured CoT with matrix-based planning and feedback-driven replanning, improving robustness and interpretability without external solvers.

Abstract: As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel theoretical insight enables student LLMs to surpass teachers on domain tasks via Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation and Adaptive Weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distillation methods lead to suboptimal performance due to the capacity gap between large teacher and small student models, prompting the need for methods that allow student models to match or exceed teacher performance in domain-specific tasks.

Method: Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD) to emulate the teacher's convergence process, reducing the TFS deficit; and an Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on the SFS.

Result: Experiments on diverse tasks show that SCD and AW outperform existing distillation approaches across multiple languages.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes and validates the theoretical condition under which student models can outperform teacher models in domain-specific tasks, proposing SCD and AW as effective methods to achieve this goal.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are challenging to deploy for domain-specific tasks due to their massive scale. While distilling a fine-tuned LLM into a smaller student model is a promising alternative, the capacity gap between teacher and student often leads to suboptimal performance. This raises a key question: when and how can a student model match or even surpass its teacher on domain-specific tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS. Experiments across diverse domain tasks--including QA, NER, and text classification in multiple languages--show that our method consistently outperforms existing distillation approaches, allowing the student model to match or even exceed the performance of its fine-tuned teacher.

TL;DR: LLMs underperform dedicated ML models in predicting time intervals between recurring user actions, challenging the assumption that more context always improves reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show impressive reasoning capabilities, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored, particularly for predicting time intervals between recurring user actions.

Method: Systematic study benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against statistical and machine-learning models using a simple repurchase scenario, testing how different levels of contextual information affect predictions.

Result: 1) LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines but consistently underperform dedicated ML models, showing limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. 2) Moderate context improves LLM accuracy, but adding further user-level detail degrades performance, challenging the "more context leads to better reasoning" assumption.

Conclusion: The study reveals fundamental limitations of current LLMs in structured temporal inference and offers guidance for designing future context-aware hybrid models that integrate statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning and prediction across different domains. Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that "more context leads to better reasoning". Our study highlights fundamental limitations of today's LLMs in structured temporal inference and offers guidance for designing future context-aware hybrid models that integrate statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.

Motivation: Models trained on static historical data often overfit and fail to generalize in dynamic financial markets due to concept drift and distributional non-stationarity, creating a critical gap between training and real-world performance.

Method: A drift-aware dataflow system with a parameterized data manipulation module (single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, curation operations) coupled with an adaptive planner-scheduler using gradient-based bi-level optimization for control.

Result: Extensive experiments on forecasting and reinforcement learning trading tasks demonstrate enhanced model robustness and improved risk-adjusted returns.

Conclusion: The system provides a generalizable approach to adaptive data management and learning-guided workflow automation for financial data, addressing the "History Is Not Enough" challenge in quantitative finance.

Abstract: In quantitative finance, the gap between training and real-world performance-driven by concept drift and distributional non-stationarity-remains a critical obstacle for building reliable data-driven systems. Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra "History Is Not Enough" underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning-based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system. This design unifies data augmentation, curriculum learning, and data workflow management under a single differentiable framework, enabling provenance-aware replay and continuous data quality monitoring. Extensive experiments on forecasting and reinforcement learning trading tasks demonstrate that our framework enhances model robustness and improves risk-adjusted returns. The system provides a generalizable approach to adaptive data management and learning-guided workflow automation for financial data.

TL;DR: DecisionLLM applies large language models to offline sequential decision-making by treating trajectories as a modality and aligning them with natural language, outperforming Decision Transformer on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have shown success in reasoning and planning tasks, sharing the same Transformer foundation as Decision Transformers, suggesting they could unlock better performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making if their inability to interpret continuous values can be addressed.

Method: Treats trajectories as a distinct modality and learns to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, enabling autoregressive prediction of future decisions within a framework called DecisionLLM.

Result: DecisionLLM-3B outperforms Decision Transformer by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet, with performance scaling based on model size, data volume, and data quality.

Conclusion: LLMs can be effectively applied to offline decision-making tasks by addressing continuous value interpretation through trajectory modality alignment, establishing scaling laws, and demonstrating strong performance that extends the AIGB paradigm.

Abstract: Long-sequence decision-making, which is usually addressed through reinforcement learning (RL), is a critical component for optimizing strategic operations in dynamic environments, such as real-time bidding in computational advertising. The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet. It extends the AIGB paradigm and points to promising directions for future exploration in online bidding.

The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in a clinical use case through comparative evaluation of lung segmentation models. To further strengthen transparency and reproducibility, we publicly release the generated segmentations and evaluation metrics and provide interactive dashboards that allow readers to inspect individual cases and reproduce or extend our analysis. By simplifying model use, MHub.ai enables side-by-side benchmarking with identical execution commands and standardized outputs, and lowers the barrier to clinical translation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMPG constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives (physical, chemical, geometric) and fuses them adaptively using a Mixture of Experts module to produce superior protein representations for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based Protein Representation Learning methods rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which only capture partial properties of residue interactions, leading to incomplete protein representations.

Method: The framework constructs protein graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives. It then uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module that dynamically routes different perspectives to specialized experts. These experts learn both perspective-specific intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions across three levels: individual representations, pairwise synergies, and global consensus.

Result: MMPG achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks. The MoE module is quantitatively verified to automatically specialize experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction: individual representations, pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and global consensus across all perspectives.

Conclusion: MMPG successfully integrates multi-perspective protein graphs via a specialized MoE module, resulting in superior protein representations and state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted for Protein Representation Learning (PRL), as residue interaction networks can be naturally represented as graphs. Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents learn compositional generalization via a two-step decompose-compose framework, enabling zero-shot description of novel images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how artificial neural agents can acquire and utilize compositional generalization - the human cognitive ability to systematically combine known concepts in novel ways to describe previously unseen images.

Method: A two-step training method called "Composition through Decomposition": (1) Decompose step - agents learn to break down images into basic concepts using a codebook acquired from a multi-target coordination game, (2) Compose step - agents use this codebook to describe novel images by composing basic concepts into complex phrases.

Result: The agents successfully learn to decompose images into basic concepts and then compose these concepts to describe novel images. Remarkably, the agents achieve zero-shot generalization in the Compose step without additional training.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that artificial neural agents can develop compositional generalization through a simple decompose-compose framework, achieving zero-shot generalization in some cases. This approach mimics human cognitive compositionality.

Abstract: Compositionality is a cognitive mechanism that allows humans to systematically combine known concepts in novel ways. This study demonstrates how artificial neural agents acquire and utilize compositional generalization to describe previously unseen images. Our method, termed "Composition through Decomposition", involves two sequential training steps. In the 'Decompose' step, the agents learn to decompose an image into basic concepts using a codebook acquired during interaction in a multi-target coordination game. Subsequently, in the 'Compose' step, the agents employ this codebook to describe novel images by composing basic concepts into complex phrases. Remarkably, we observe cases where generalization in the `Compose' step is achieved zero-shot, without the need for additional training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A workflow combining distortion metrics and ML classification was developed to evaluate downsampling impact on nEMG signals for neuromuscular disease detection, identifying optimal configurations that maintain diagnostic performance while enabling near real-time analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High and heterogeneous sampling rates of needle electromyography (nEMG) signals pose computational challenges for feature-based machine learning models, especially for near real-time neuromuscular disease detection. The impact of downsampling on diagnostic content and classification performance is not well understood.

Method: A workflow combining shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to systematically evaluate information loss from downsampling in high-frequency time series.

Result: The workflow successfully identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation by better preserving peak structure and overall signal morphology.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow effectively identifies downsampling configurations that maintain diagnostic information while reducing computational load. Shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation in preserving signal morphology, offering practical guidance for near real-time nEMG analysis applications and providing a generalizable approach for other high-frequency time-series domains.

Abstract: Automated analysis of needle electromyography (nEMG) signals is emerging as a tool to support the detection of neuromuscular diseases (NMDs), yet the signals' high and heterogeneous sampling rates pose substantial computational challenges for feature-based machine-learning models, particularly for near real-time analysis. Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.

### [31] [GFM4GA: Graph Foundation Model for Group Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10193)
*Jiujiu Chen,Weijun Zeng,Shaofeng Hu,Sihong Xie,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel graph foundation model called GFM4GA is proposed for group anomaly detection, using dual-level contrastive pretraining and few-shot finetuning to handle unseen group anomalies, outperforming existing methods in AUROC and AUPRC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group anomaly detection is crucial in network applications but faces challenges due to diverse anomaly patterns. While graph foundation models (GFMs) have been successful for individual anomaly detection with few-shot learning, they cannot generalize to group anomalies because group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole, and individuals in an abnormal group can appear normal. Therefore, a novel graph foundation model specifically designed for group anomaly detection is needed.

Method: The proposed method involves a pipeline pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction to capture potential group anomaly structures and feature inconsistencies. In downstream tasks, the model is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, with adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors.

Result: Experiments show that GFM4GA surpasses both group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, achieving average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.

Conclusion: The GFM4GA model successfully addresses the limitations of existing graph foundation models in detecting group anomalies by introducing a pretraining approach that captures group-level anomaly structures and feature inconsistencies, and a finetuning strategy that adapts to few-shot scenarios with unseen anomalies, achieving superior performance over both group anomaly detectors and individual anomaly GFMs.

Abstract: Group anomaly detection is crucial in many network applications, but faces challenges due to diverse anomaly patterns. Motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, graph foundation models (GFMs) is proposed to handle few-shot learning task with fewer labeling efforts. GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection. The pipeline is pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction, to capture potential group anomaly structure and feature inconsistencies. In the downstream tasks, the pipeline is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, and its adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors. Experiments show that GFM4GA surpasses group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, achieving average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.

*Alex Dantart,Marco Kóvacs-Navarro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Topo-RAG introduces a dual-architecture framework that processes narrative and tabular data separately, preserving spatial relationships in tables rather than linearizing them, achieving 18.4% better retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise datasets are complex amalgams of narrative and structure, but current RAG systems use linearization which is mathematically insufficient for capturing multidimensional data like spreadsheets in single vectors.

Method: Dual architecture: traditional dense retrievers for narrative text plus Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism for tabular structures to preserve spatial relationships.

Result: 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus.

Conclusion: Current RAG systems' linearization approach is mathematically insufficient for enterprise data's complex nature, and Topo-RAG demonstrates that respecting data topology through specialized architectures leads to better information understanding and retrieval performance.

Abstract: In enterprise datasets, documents are rarely pure. They are not just text, nor just numbers; they are a complex amalgam of narrative and structure. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have attempted to address this complexity with a blunt tool: linearization. We convert rich, multidimensional tables into simple Markdown-style text strings, hoping that an embedding model will capture the geometry of a spreadsheet in a single vector. But it has already been shown that this is mathematically insufficient.
  This work presents Topo-RAG, a framework that challenges the assumption that "everything is text". We propose a dual architecture that respects the topology of the data: we route fluid narrative through traditional dense retrievers, while tabular structures are processed by a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism, preserving their spatial relationships. Evaluated on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus that mimics real-world complexity, Topo-RAG demonstrates an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches. It's not just about searching better; it's about understanding the shape of information.

### [33] [TRIM: Hybrid Inference via Targeted Stepwise Routing in Multi-Step Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10245)
*Vansh Kapoor,Aman Gupta,Hao Chen,Anurag Beniwal,Jing Huang,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRIM is a targeted routing system for multi-step reasoning that routes only critical steps to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine steps, achieving significant efficiency gains without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step reasoning tasks like mathematical problem solving are vulnerable to cascading failures where a single incorrect step leads to complete solution breakdown. Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal, which is inefficient.

Method: TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks) operates at step-level using process reward models to identify erroneous steps. It makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints, with routing strategies ranging from simple threshold-based policies to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates.

Result: On MATH-500, TRIM's simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency. More advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks like AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency. All methods generalize effectively across math reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: TRIM demonstrates that targeted step-level interventions in multi-step reasoning can fundamentally transform inference efficiency. The approach effectively confines expensive model calls to critical steps while maintaining solution quality, with advanced routing policies achieving strong model performance using significantly fewer expensive tokens (80% fewer on MATH-500). The method generalizes well across math reasoning tasks, showing step-level difficulty represents fundamental characteristics of reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning tasks like mathematical problem solving are vulnerable to cascading failures, where a single incorrect step leads to complete solution breakdown. Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal. We propose TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks), which routes only critical steps$\unicode{x2013}$those likely to derail the solution$\unicode{x2013}$to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine continuations. Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks such as AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency. All methods generalize effectively across math reasoning tasks, demonstrating that step-level difficulty represents fundamental characteristics of reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NoReGeo benchmark evaluates LLMs' intrinsic geometric understanding without reasoning or algebra, revealing current models struggle with native geometric comprehension and require specialized training approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks primarily assess reasoning-based geometry using algebraic methods, but there is a need to evaluate whether LLMs can inherently encode spatial relationships and recognize geometric properties directly without relying on reasoning or computation.

Method: Created NoReGeo benchmark with 2,500 trivial geometric problems across 25 categories designed to be solvable through pure geometric understanding without reasoning or algebra. Evaluated state-of-the-art models including GPT-4 on binary classification tasks and conducted ablation experiments on fine-tuning approaches.

Result: Even the most advanced models (including GPT-4) achieved only 65% maximum accuracy on binary classification tasks. Ablation experiments showed that geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating specialized training is required from the beginning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have a significant gap in native geometric understanding, requiring specialized training approaches from the outset rather than fine-tuning alone. NoReGeo serves as a foundational benchmark for future research towards models with true geometric cognition.

Abstract: We present NoReGeo, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the intrinsic geometric understanding of large language models (LLMs) without relying on reasoning or algebraic computation. Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily assess models' proficiency in reasoning-based geometry-where solutions are derived using algebraic methods-NoReGeo focuses on evaluating whether LLMs can inherently encode spatial relationships and recognize geometric properties directly. Our benchmark comprises 2,500 trivial geometric problems spanning 25 categories, each carefully crafted to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding, assuming known object locations. We assess a range of state-of-the-art models on NoReGeo, including frontier models like GPT-4, observing that even the most advanced systems achieve an overall maximum of 65% accuracy in binary classification tasks. Further, our ablation experiments demonstrate that such geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating that effective training for geometric comprehension requires a specialized approach from the outset. Our findings highlight a significant gap in current LLMs' ability to natively grasp geometric concepts, providing a foundation for future research toward models with true geometric cognition.

TL;DR: string


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: string

Method: string

Result: string

Conclusion: false

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has advanced LLM reasoning, applying it to long-context scenarios is hindered by sparsity of outcome rewards. This limitation fails to penalize ungrounded "lucky guesses," leaving the critical process of needle-in-a-haystack evidence retrieval largely unsupervised. To address this, we propose EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization). We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance. Comprehensive evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate that EAPO significantly enhances long-context reasoning performance compared to SOTA baselines.

TL;DR: C-GRASP addresses LLM hallucinations in HRV analysis through a traceable reasoning pipeline with RSA guardrails and individualized baseline prioritization, improving emotion classification accuracy and clinical reasoning consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges when interpreting Heart Rate Variability (HRV) due to physiological hallucinations, including respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) contamination, short-data instability in nonlinear metrics, and over-reliance on population norms rather than individualized baselines.

Method: C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing) is a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps. It features a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that weights individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics, and includes automated RSA-aware guardrails to prevent spectral contamination. The system integrates with high-scale reasoning models like MedGemma3-thinking.

Result: Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP achieved 37.3% accuracy in 4-class emotion classification and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirmed that the individualized Delta Z-score module is critical for preventing population bias common in native LLMs.

Conclusion: C-GRASP represents a significant advancement in HRV interpretation by providing a transparent, evidence-based framework that mitigates physiological hallucinations in LLMs. It paves the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering by shifting affective computing from black-box classification to clinical decision support systems grounded in individualized analysis.

Abstract: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a pivotal noninvasive marker for autonomic monitoring; however, applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to HRV interpretation is hindered by physiological hallucinations. These include respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) contamination, short-data instability in nonlinear metrics, and the neglect of individualized baselines in favor of population norms. We propose C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing), a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps. Central to C-GRASP is a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that enforces the weighting of individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics. The system effectively mitigates spectral hallucinations through automated RSA-aware guardrails, preventing contamination of frequency-domain indices. Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP integrated with high-scale reasoning models (e.g., MedGemma3-thinking) achieved superior performance in 4-class emotion classification (37.3% accuracy) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirm that the individualized Delta Z-score module serves as the critical logical anchor, preventing the "population bias" common in native LLMs. Ultimately, C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, paving the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LatentRefusal is a novel refusal mechanism for text-to-SQL systems that predicts query answerability from intermediate LLM activations, improving safety with minimal latency overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing refusal strategies for unanswerable and underspecified queries in text-to-SQL systems are either brittle due to model hallucinations (output-level instruction following) or add complexity and overhead (uncertainty estimation), posing barriers to safe deployment.

Method: Formalizes safe refusal as an answerability-gating problem and proposes LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism using hidden activations from LLMs. Introduces a Tri-Residual Gated Encoder architecture to suppress schema noise and amplify question-schema mismatch cues.

Result: Extensive evaluations show LatentRefusal improves average F1 to 88.5% across four benchmarks on both backbones with only ~2ms probe overhead. Ablation studies and interpretability analyses demonstrate effectiveness.

Conclusion: LatentRefusal effectively addresses the safety challenge in text-to-SQL systems by introducing an attachable, efficient refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from latent signals, significantly outperforming existing methods while adding minimal overhead.

Abstract: In LLM-based text-to-SQL systems, unanswerable and underspecified user queries may generate not only incorrect text but also executable programs that yield misleading results or violate safety constraints, posing a major barrier to safe deployment. Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems. Across four benchmarks, LatentRefusal improves average F1 to 88.5 percent on both backbones while adding approximately 2 milliseconds of probe overhead.

TL;DR: ML-Master 2.0 introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching to enable AI agents to maintain strategic coherence over ultra-long experimental cycles, achieving 56.44% medal rate on MLE-Bench and showing scalable autonomous scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the bottleneck in AI agentic science caused by ultra-long-horizon autonomy challenges. Current LLMs struggle with sustaining strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks, as they get overwhelmed by execution details and fail to consolidate sparse feedback into long-term guidance.

Method: The method introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that reframes context management as cognitive accumulation. HCC dynamically distills transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, allowing agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term strategy.

Result: In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%, demonstrating superior performance in ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the HCC architecture enables AI agents to achieve ultra-long-horizon autonomy in complex scientific discovery tasks, providing a scalable blueprint for autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence toward agentic science is currently bottlenecked by the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy, the ability to sustain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.

TL;DR: ErrEval: An error-aware evaluation framework that improves Automatic Question Generation assessment by using explicit error diagnostics in a two-stage process of error identification and evidence-informed scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for Automatic Question Generation (QG) suffer from critical limitations: they are black-box and holistic approaches without explicit error modeling, leading to neglect of defects like factual hallucinations and answer mismatches, and resulting in overestimation of question quality.

Method: ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process: 1) a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier that detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects; 2) incorporating these diagnostic signals as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate ErrEval's effectiveness, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.

Conclusion: ErrEval effectively addresses limitations in existing QG evaluation methods by introducing an error-aware framework that improves alignment with human judgments and mitigates overestimation of low-quality questions.

Abstract: Automatic Question Generation (QG) often produces outputs with critical defects, such as factual hallucinations and answer mismatches. However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.

TL;DR: LLM-based framework with RAG extracts personal data flows from privacy policies, validated in automotive industry case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy policies are difficult for people to comprehend due to complex legal language and inconsistent practices. There's a need for automated, large-scale analysis to help understand personal data processing practices.

Method: Combines LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customized knowledge base. The framework includes pre-processor, LLM-based processor, and data flow post-processor to extract data flows from unstructured privacy policy text and construct personal data flow graphs.

Result: Developed LADFA framework validated through automotive industry case study with 10 privacy policies, demonstrating effectiveness and accuracy in extracting personal data flows and constructing data flow graphs.

Conclusion: LADFA provides an effective framework for analyzing privacy policies by extracting personal data flows using LLMs enhanced with RAG. The approach is validated in automotive industry case studies and offers flexibility for broader text analysis applications.

Abstract: Privacy policies help inform people about organisations' personal data processing practices, covering different aspects such as data collection, data storage, and sharing of personal data with third parties. Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.

*Tiesunlong Shen,Rui Mao,Jin Wang,Heming Sun,Jian Zhang,Xuejie Zhang,Erik Cambria*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMdoctor is a novel test-time alignment framework that uses token-level reward acquisition and flow-guided optimization to align frozen LLMs efficiently while preserving diversity, outperforming both existing test-time and fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning methods for aligning LLMs with human preferences are computationally expensive and inflexible. Test-time alignment approaches exist but often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, limiting performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model.

Method: LLMdoctor operates via a patient-doctor paradigm with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO). It extracts fine-grained token-level preference signals from behavioral variations of a frozen patient LLM, then trains a smaller doctor model via TFPO to establish flow consistency across all subtrajectories for precise token-by-token alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.

Conclusion: LLMdoctor offers an effective and efficient approach to test-time alignment that preserves generation diversity while achieving superior performance over existing methods, representing a promising direction for aligning large language models without full fine-tuning.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical, yet traditional fine-tuning methods are computationally expensive and inflexible. While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.

*Ziming Dai,Dabiao Ma,Jinle Tong,Mengyuan Han,Jian Yang,Haojun Fei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NSR-Boost is a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework that safely upgrades legacy GBDT models by repairing hard prediction regions using LLM-generated symbolic experts, without retraining the entire model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the prohibitive retraining costs and systemic risks of upgrading legacy GBDT models in high-concurrency production environments, where traditional model updates are challenging.

Method: The framework comprises three key stages: 1) finding hard regions through residuals, 2) generating interpretable experts using LLM-generated symbolic code structures with fine-tuning via Bayesian optimization, and 3) dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator.

Result: NSR-Boost significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data, and successfully deployed in core financial risk control system.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that NSR-Boost effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industry, with successful deployment in a financial risk control system.

Abstract: Although the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) dominate industrial tabular applications, upgrading legacy models in high-concurrency production environments still faces prohibitive retraining costs and systemic risks. To address this problem, we present NSR-Boost, a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework designed specifically for industrial scenarios. Its core advantage lies in being "non-intrusive". It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on "hard regions" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings. This framework not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, more importantly, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data. In conclusion, it effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industry.

TL;DR: A new dataset called ChartComplete is proposed to address limitations in current benchmarks by covering 30 chart types, based on a taxonomy from visualization, but without learning signal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for measuring MLLM performance in chart understanding are limited to few chart types, creating a gap.

Method: Propose ChartComplete dataset based on a chart taxonomy from visualization, covering 30 chart types, as a collection of classified chart images.

Result: ChartComplete dataset is compiled and presented to the community, serving as a resource for building upon, but lacks learning signal.

Conclusion: ChartComplete bridges the gap by providing a more diverse dataset, enabling better benchmark development for chart understanding in MLLMs.

Abstract: With advancements in deep learning (DL) and computer vision techniques, the field of chart understanding is evolving rapidly. In particular, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proving to be efficient and accurate in understanding charts. To accurately measure the performance of MLLMs, the research community has developed multiple datasets to serve as benchmarks. By examining these datasets, we found that they are all limited to a small set of chart types. To bridge this gap, we propose the ChartComplete dataset. The dataset is based on a chart taxonomy borrowed from the visualization community, and it covers thirty different chart types. The dataset is a collection of classified chart images and does not include a learning signal. We present the ChartComplete dataset as is to the community to build upon it.

TL;DR: Proposes DKGF task to enrich domain-specific knowledge graphs using general knowledge graphs, addressing challenges of domain relevance ambiguity and granularity misalignment via ExeFuse's Fact-as-Program paradigm, with comprehensive benchmarks demonstrating effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific knowledge graphs (DKGs) often lack coverage compared to general knowledge graphs (GKGs). There is a need to enrich DKGs by integrating relevant facts from GKGs, but this faces challenges of high ambiguity in domain relevance and misalignment in knowledge granularity across graphs.

Method: ExeFuse, a simple yet effective Fact-as-Program paradigm that treats each GKG fact as a latent semantic program, maps abstract relations to granularity-aware operators, and verifies domain relevance via program executability on the target DKG. This unified probabilistic framework jointly resolves relevance and granularity issues.

Result: Two benchmarks (DKGF(W-I) and DKGF(Y-I)) were constructed with 21 evaluation configurations, establishing the first standardized testbed for DKGF. Extensive experiments validated both the importance of the DKGF task and the effectiveness of the proposed ExeFuse model.

Conclusion: The paper introduces DKGF as a new research task and proposes ExeFuse, a Fact-as-Program paradigm that effectively addresses the challenges of domain relevance ambiguity and knowledge granularity misalignment. The creation of two benchmarks with 21 evaluation configurations establishes the first standardized testbed for DKGF research, validating both the task's importance and the model's effectiveness.

Abstract: Domain-specific knowledge graphs (DKGs) often lack coverage compared to general knowledge graphs (GKGs). To address this, we introduce Domain-specific Knowledge Graph Fusion (DKGF), a novel task that enriches DKGs by integrating relevant facts from GKGs. DKGF faces two key challenges: high ambiguity in domain relevance and misalignment in knowledge granularity across graphs. We propose ExeFuse, a simple yet effective Fact-as-Program paradigm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces GRACE, a neuro-symbolic architecture that separates normative from instrumental reasoning in AI agents, providing interpretability and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing autonomy, deployment, and efficacy of AI agents require ensuring their decisions are not only instrumentally effective but also normatively aligned.

Method: Three modules with specified roles are introduced: Moral Module (MM) for permissible macro actions; Decision-Making Module (DMM) for optimal primitive actions within macro actions; Guard for monitoring and enforcement.

Result: This paper describes how such an architecture works; in particular, the symbolic representation of the MM enriches the DMM's context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture called GRACE to normatively align AI agent decisions, and demonstrates its application to an LLM therapy assistant to enable stakeholder understanding and contestability.

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, widely deployed in consequential contexts, and efficacious in bringing about real-world impacts, ensuring that their decisions are not only instrumentally effective but also normatively aligned has become critical. We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diagnostic framework reveals architecture-data synergy drives generalization in fine-tuned LLMs; Gemma 2 excels with diverse data, Llama 3.1 fails to integrate diversity, and Mistral is consistently resilient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs achieves state-of-the-art performance on specialized tasks, but diagnosing why these models become brittle and fail to generalize remains a critical open problem.

Method: Multi-layered diagnostic framework applied to a cross-architectural study of three LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral) fine-tuned on phishing detection, using SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover root causes of generalization failures.

Result: 1) Generalization is driven by synergy between architecture and data diversity (Gemma 2 9B achieves >91% F1 only with diverse 'generalist' dataset). 2) Generalization is architecture-dependent (Llama 3.1 8B performs well on narrow domain but fails to integrate diverse data). 3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable (Mistral is consistent across training paradigms).

Conclusion: Reliable AI requires deep validation of the interplay between architecture, data, and training strategy, and the diagnostic framework presented provides a concrete methodology for understanding generalization failures in fine-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: The practice of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved state-of-the-art performance on specialized tasks, yet diagnosing why these models become brittle and fail to generalize remains a critical open problem. To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop. (3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable. The Mistral model proves to be a consistent and resilient performer across multiple training paradigms. By pinpointing the flawed heuristics responsible for these failures, our work provides a concrete methodology for diagnosing and understanding generalization failures, underscoring that reliable AI requires deep validation of the interplay between architecture, data, and training strategy.

TL;DR: Integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models reveals safety is multidimensional and heterogeneous; GPT-5.2 is strongest, while models show trade-offs and vulnerabilities, especially in adversarial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether advances in LLMs and MLLMs yield commensurate improvements in safety, given fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models.

Method: Unified protocol integrating benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation across language, vision-language, and image generation settings.

Result: Aggregated evaluations reveal a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. GPT-5.2 shows consistently strong and balanced safety performance; other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation.

Conclusion: Safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional—shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.

TL;DR: Proposes SafeProbing, using latent safety signals during LLM decoding for early detection of unsafe content, effectively defending against jailbreaks while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite safety alignment efforts, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defenses struggle with sophisticated attacks, often compromising detection robustness or degrading model utility.

Method: Proposed approach surfaces and leverages latent safety signals during LLM decoding for early detection of unsafe content.

Result: Experiments show the approach significantly enhances safety against diverse jailbreak attacks with low over-refusal on benign inputs and preserved response quality.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that leveraging latent safety signals during LLM decoding provides an effective and complementary defense against jailbreak attacks. The proposed SafeProbing approach significantly enhances safety while maintaining utility on benign inputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A symbolic algorithm for LTLf synthesis with multiple properties that avoids enumerating property subsets, delivering up to 100× speedup over enumeration methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In LTLf (Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces) synthesis, there may be multiple properties, but satisfying all of them could be impossible. Existing approaches that enumerate subsets of properties are inefficient because they handle each subset separately.

Method: The method introduces Boolean goal variables to encode goal (property) combinations and uses a fully symbolic fixed-point computation over the product game structure. It exploits monotonicity of realizability with respect to goal sets to compactly represent exponentially many goal combinations.

Result: The proposed algorithm outperforms enumeration‑based baselines by up to two orders of magnitude (100× faster). It computes, in a single fixed‑point pass, the relation between product‑game states and the maximal realizable goal sets, and synthesizes strategies achieving those sets.

Conclusion: To summarize, the authors develop a compact symbolic algorithm for LTLf synthesis with multiple properties, which avoids enumeration and yields substantial performance gains (up to 100× faster). The core idea is to use a fixed-point computation on product games with goal variables and exploit monotonicity for space efficiency.

Abstract: We study LTLf synthesis with multiple properties, where satisfying all properties may be impossible. Instead of enumerating subsets of properties, we compute in one fixed-point computation the relation between product-game states and the goal sets that are realizable from them, and we synthesize strategies achieving maximal realizable sets. We develop a fully symbolic algorithm that introduces Boolean goal variables and exploits monotonicity to represent exponentially many goal combinations compactly. Our approach substantially outperforms enumeration-based baselines, with speedups of up to two orders of magnitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, including its surprising weaknesses in reasoning.

Method: Conducted a mechanistic study on HRM's reasoning patterns, identifying failure points like fixed point property violations and multiple fixed points, then proposed scaling strategies: data augmentation, input perturbation, and model bootstrapping.

Result: Developed Augmented HRM, which improved accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9% by combining these strategies.

Conclusion: HRM appears to guess rather than reason, but scaling guesses can significantly enhance performance, offering new insights into reasoning models.

Abstract: Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) "Grokking" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM "guesses" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be "guessing" instead of "reasoning". Leveraging this "guessing" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%. On the scientific side, our analysis provides new insights into how reasoning models "reason".

Abstract: Social Determinants of Health correlate with patient outcomes but are rarely captured in structured data. Recent attention has been given to automatically extracting these markers from clinical text to supplement diagnostic systems with knowledge of patients' social circumstances. Large language models demonstrate strong performance in identifying Social Determinants of Health labels from sentences. However, prediction in large admissions or longitudinal notes is challenging given long distance dependencies. In this paper, we explore hospital admission multi-label Social Determinants of Health ICD-9 code classification on the MIMIC-III dataset using reasoning models and traditional large language models. We exploit existing ICD-9 codes for prediction on admissions, which achieved an 89% F1.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer self-attention at high confidence operates in tropical algebra, performing path-finding dynamic programming on token graphs, explaining chain-of-thought reasoning geometrically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental mathematical operation of Transformer self-attention in its high-confidence limit, and to reveal the geometric interpretation of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the Transformer self-attention mechanism in the limit as β→∞ (high-confidence regime), showing that softmax attention converges to tropical matrix multiplication (max-plus algebra).

Result: Softmax attention converts to tropical matrix product in the β→∞ limit, revealing that Transformer forward passes execute Bellman-Ford style dynamic programming for path-finding on latent token similarity graphs.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that Transformers' self-attention mechanism in the high-confidence limit is fundamentally a tropical matrix product, revealing their underlying operation as a dynamic programming algorithm for path-finding on token similarity graphs.

Abstract: We prove that the Transformer self-attention mechanism in the high-confidence regime ($β\to \infty$, where $β$ is an inverse temperature) operates in the tropical semiring (max-plus algebra). In particular, we show that taking the tropical limit of the softmax attention converts it into a tropical matrix product. This reveals that the Transformer's forward pass is effectively executing a dynamic programming recurrence (specifically, a Bellman-Ford path-finding update) on a latent graph defined by token similarities. Our theoretical result provides a new geometric perspective for chain-of-thought reasoning: it emerges from an inherent shortest-path (or longest-path) algorithm being carried out within the network's computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanation methods for black-box time series models are sensitive to distributional shifts and don't generalize outside training support, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications where interpretability and trust are essential.

Method: Proposed TimeSAE framework using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causal analysis to explain black-box models for time series data, focusing on generalization capability outside training distribution.

Result: Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets show TimeSAE provides more faithful and robust explanations than leading baselines, supported by both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights.

Conclusion: TimeSAE provides a causal, robust framework for explaining black-box time series models that generalizes well under distribution shifts through sparse autoencoders, making it more suitable for real-world applications than existing methods.

Abstract: As black box models and pretrained models gain traction in time series applications, understanding and explaining their predictions becomes increasingly vital, especially in high-stakes domains where interpretability and trust are essential. However, most of the existing methods involve only in-distribution explanation, and do not generalize outside the training support, which requires the learning capability of generalization. In this work, we aim to provide a framework to explain black-box models for time series data through the dual lenses of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causality. We show that many current explanation methods are sensitive to distributional shifts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Building on the concept of Sparse Autoencoder, we introduce TimeSAE, a framework for black-box model explanation. We conduct extensive evaluations of TimeSAE on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets, comparing it to leading baselines. The results, supported by both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, show that TimeSAE provides more faithful and robust explanations.

Motivation: federated learning faces challenges with statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and computational burden from complex models in privacy-sensitive domains; quantum computing could help reduce parameters and training overhead.

Method: proposes QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework that reduces model parameters using quantum computing principles and evaluates it using the FashionMNIST dataset with VGG-like models.

Result: QFed achieves a 77.6% reduction in parameter count for VGG-like models while maintaining accuracy comparable to classical approaches in scalable environments.

Conclusion: quantum-assisted federated learning framework called QFed demonstrates promising potential for reducing computational overhead while maintaining comparable accuracy to classical federated learning approaches, showing viability for practical edge computing applications.

Abstract: Organizations and enterprises across domains such as healthcare, finance, and scientific research are increasingly required to extract collective intelligence from distributed, siloed datasets while adhering to strict privacy, regulatory, and sovereignty requirements. Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model building without sharing sensitive raw data, but faces growing challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and the computational burden from complex models. This study examines the potential of quantum-assisted federated learning, which could cut the number of parameters in classical models by polylogarithmic factors and thus lessen training overhead. Accordingly, we introduce QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework aimed at boosting computational efficiency across edge device networks. We evaluate the proposed framework using the widely adopted FashionMNIST dataset. Experimental results show that QFed achieves a 77.6% reduction in the parameter count of a VGG-like model while maintaining an accuracy comparable to classical approaches in a scalable environment. These results point to the potential of leveraging quantum computing within a federated learning context to strengthen FL capabilities of edge devices.

Motivation: The standard eluder dimension analysis applied to generalized linear models yields a provable lower bound that precludes first-order regret bounds (i.e., regret scaling with the optimal reward gap). This motivates a more refined analysis to achieve such improved bounds.

Method: The paper introduces a localisation method for the eluder dimension, allowing for refined analysis. The localised approach modifies the standard eluder dimension to be more sensitive to problem structure.

Result: The paper proves a lower bound on the eluder dimension for generalized linear models. Their localisation method recovers and improves classic first-order regret bounds for Bernoulli bandits and, for the first time, provides genuine first-order regret bounds for finite-horizon RL with bounded cumulative returns.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that localizing the eluder dimension via their new method is a viable approach to overcome previous limitations, enabling first-order regret analysis in multi-armed bandit and finite-horizon reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: We establish a lower bound on the eluder dimension of generalised linear model classes, showing that standard eluder dimension-based analysis cannot lead to first-order regret bounds. To address this, we introduce a localisation method for the eluder dimension; our analysis immediately recovers and improves on classic results for Bernoulli bandits, and allows for the first genuine first-order bounds for finite-horizon reinforcement learning tasks with bounded cumulative returns.

Conclusion: A new convergence theory for PnP-PGD under prior mismatch is established, removing restrictive assumptions and filling a gap in theoretical understanding of these algorithms.

Abstract: In this work, we provide a new convergence theory for plug-and-play proximal gradient descent (PnP-PGD) under prior mismatch where the denoiser is trained on a different data distribution to the inference task at hand. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence proof of PnP-PGD under prior mismatch.

*Aparajita Kashyap,Sara Matijevic,Noémie Elhadad,Steven A. Kushner,Shalmali Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair ML models in healthcare that addresses both direct and indirect biases through path-specific causal fairness analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent machine learning models in healthcare from replicating or exacerbating existing biases, with focus on path-specific causal fairness to better account for social and medical contexts of bias occurrence (direct discrimination vs. differential access disparities).

Method: The authors map the structural fairness model to observational healthcare settings and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models that explicitly considers healthcare context and disparities to define target 'fair' models. They leverage foundation models trained without fairness constraints on observational health data.

Result: The work fills two gaps: 1) expands characterization of fairness-accuracy tradeoffs by disentangling direct and indirect bias sources, presenting fairness alongside accuracy considerations for known biases; 2) demonstrates how foundation models can generate causally fair downstream predictions for tasks with known disparities.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates that foundation models trained on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions, addressing both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias through a model-agnostic pipeline.

Abstract: When training machine learning (ML) models for potential deployment in a healthcare setting, it is essential to ensure that they do not replicate or exacerbate existing healthcare biases. Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target "fair" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the "fairness-accuracy" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities. This work presents a model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models that address both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias.

TL;DR: Integrated framework combining GPTQ quantization, LoRA tuning, and data distillation enables 2x LLM compression for edge deployment while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges on resource-constrained edge devices due to high computational, memory, and energy demands. There is a need to optimize these models for edge deployment while addressing three key challenges: acquiring task-specific data, fine-tuning for performance, and compressing models for efficient inference.

Method: The method combines GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA fine-tuning), and a specialized data distillation process. It employs knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer for efficient fine-tuning and compression.

Result: The framework achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient specialized task inference. Empirical results show superior performance on standard LLM benchmarks compared to GPTQ quantization alone, with the Muon optimizer enhancing fine-tuned models' resistance to accuracy decay during quantization.

Conclusion: The proposed integrated framework effectively addresses key LLM deployment challenges on edge devices by combining GPTQ quantization, LoRA tuning, and data distillation with advanced optimization techniques. The approach demonstrates up to 2x memory compression while maintaining or enhancing task-specific performance, with the Muon optimizer playing a crucial role in preserving accuracy during quantization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable advanced natural language processing but face deployment challenges on resource-constrained edge devices due to high computational, memory, and energy demands. Optimizing these models requires addressing three key challenges: acquiring task-specific data, fine-tuning for performance, and compressing models to accelerate inference while reducing resource demands. We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance on standard LLM benchmarks compared to GPTQ quantization alone, with the Muon optimizer notably enhancing fine-tuned models' resistance to accuracy decay during quantization.

*Kirandeep Kaur,Vinayak Gupta,Aditya Gupta,Chirag Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProPer introduces a proactive two-agent system that generates implicit user needs from explicit data and creates personalized, timely interventions, outperforming existing methods across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language assistants are reactive (ask-and-respond), missing unexpressed user needs. Existing proactive approaches either burden users with clarification or make mistimed interventions by extrapolating from context.

Method: ProPer uses a two-agent architecture: Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) fine-tunes an LLM to generate implicit dimensions/knowledge gaps from explicit user data, then filters them with reranker; Response Generating Agent (RGA) balances explicit and implicit dimensions to create personalized, timely proactive responses.

Result: ProPer improves quality scores and win rates across all tested domains, achieving up to 84% gains in single-turn evaluation and consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions based on coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment.

Conclusion: ProPer demonstrates the viability of separating dimension generation from response generation through a two-agent architecture, showing significant improvements over existing approaches while reducing the burdens of clarification seeking and mistimed interventions.

Abstract: Most language-based assistants follow a reactive ask-and-respond paradigm, requiring users to explicitly state their needs. As a result, relevant but unexpressed needs often go unmet. Existing proactive agents attempt to address this gap either by eliciting further clarification, preserving this burden, or by extrapolating future needs from context, often leading to unnecessary or mistimed interventions. We introduce ProPer, Proactivity-driven Personalized agents, a novel two-agent architecture consisting of a Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) and a Response Generating Agent (RGA). DGA, a fine-tuned LLM agent, leverages explicit user data to generate multiple implicit dimensions (latent aspects relevant to the user's task but not considered by the user) or knowledge gaps. These dimensions are selectively filtered using a reranker based on quality, diversity, and task relevance. RGA then balances explicit and implicit dimensions to tailor personalized responses with timely and proactive interventions. We evaluate ProPer across multiple domains using a structured, gap-aware rubric that measures coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment. Our results show that ProPer improves quality scores and win rates across all domains, achieving up to 84% gains in single-turn evaluation and consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimization-based methods for mDP work well in coarse-grained domains but face computational challenges in fine-grained or continuous settings due to dense perturbation matrices and pointwise constraints.

Method: Interpolation-based framework using sparse anchor points with log-convex combination interpolation, decomposition into 1D steps for corrected formulation, and joint optimization of perturbation distributions and privacy budget allocation across dimensions.

Result: Experiments on real-world location datasets show the method offers rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive utility in fine-grained domains, outperforming baseline mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed interpolation-based framework enables efficient optimization of mDP in fine-grained and continuous domains by using sparse anchor points and corrected interpolation, providing rigorous privacy guarantees with competitive utility that outperforms baseline mechanisms.

Abstract: Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) generalizes Local Differential Privacy (LDP) by adapting privacy guarantees based on pairwise distances, enabling context-aware protection and improved utility. While existing optimization-based methods reduce utility loss effectively in coarse-grained domains, optimizing mDP in fine-grained or continuous settings remains challenging due to the computational cost of constructing dense perterubation matrices and satisfying pointwise constraints.
  In this paper, we propose an interpolation-based framework for optimizing lp-norm mDP in such domains. Our approach optimizes perturbation distributions at a sparse set of anchor points and interpolates distributions at non-anchor locations via log-convex combinations, which provably preserve mDP. To address privacy violations caused by naive interpolation in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design. We further explore joint optimization over perturbation distributions and privacy budget allocation across dimensions. Experiments on real-world location datasets demonstrate that our method offers rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive utility in fine-grained domains, outperforming baseline mechanisms. in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design.

*Griffin Kearney*

TL;DR: Proposes Kinematic Tokenization, a continuous spline-based tokenization method for noisy time series, which outperforms discrete tokenizations in maintaining stable policies under abstention-inducing losses in financial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are designed for discrete tokens, but real-world signals are continuous processes observed through noisy sampling. Discrete tokenizations can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that encourage abstention.

Method: Kinematic Tokenization - an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). Applied to financial time series data (asset prices with trading volume profiles).

Result: Under risk-averse asymmetric classification objectives, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (Liquidation Equilibrium), while continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed.

Conclusion: Explicit continuous-time tokens (specifically Kinematic Tokenization) can significantly improve learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses, offering better stability and performance compared to discrete tokenization methods.

Abstract: Transformers are designed for discrete tokens, yet many real-world signals are continuous processes observed through noisy sampling. Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The ML value chain is unsustainable due to economic inequality where data generators get minimal value while aggregators capture most benefits, risking the learning feedback loop. Analysis of 73 data deals shows near-zero creator royalties and opaque terms. Proposed EDVEX Framework aims to create equitable data markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The machine learning value chain is structurally unsustainable due to economic data processing inequality - value systematically flows away from data generators toward aggregators. This creates both economic welfare concerns and risks to the feedback loop sustaining current learning algorithms as data becomes an economic asset.

Method: Analysis of seventy-three public data deals to examine value distribution, documentation of creator royalties, and deal transparency. Identification of three structural faults in the value chain: missing provenance, asymmetric bargaining power, and non-dynamic pricing. Proposal of the EDVEX Framework as a technical solution.

Result: Analysis shows the majority of value accrues to aggregators, with documented creator royalties effectively zero and widespread opacity in deal terms. The paper identifies three structural faults enabling this inequality and traces their effects along the ML value chain.

Conclusion: The paper proposes the Equitable Data-Value Exchange (EDVEX) Framework as a solution to enable a minimal market that benefits all participants, and outlines research directions for the community to address data deal inequities. It contextualizes the position with related viewpoints.

Abstract: We argue that the machine learning value chain is structurally unsustainable due to an economic data processing inequality: each state in the data cycle from inputs to model weights to synthetic outputs refines technical signal but strips economic equity from data generators. We show, by analyzing seventy-three public data deals, that the majority of value accrues to aggregators, with documented creator royalties rounding to zero and widespread opacity of deal terms. This is not just an economic welfare concern: as data and its derivatives become economic assets, the feedback loop that sustains current learning algorithms is at risk. We identify three structural faults - missing provenance, asymmetric bargaining power, and non-dynamic pricing - as the operational machinery of this inequality. In our analysis, we trace these problems along the machine learning value chain and propose an Equitable Data-Value Exchange (EDVEX) Framework to enable a minimal market that benefits all participants. Finally, we outline research directions where our community can make concrete contributions to data deals and contextualize our position with related and orthogonal viewpoints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in repurposing large language models (LLMs) for time series classification due to their strong reasoning and generalization abilities. However, prior work has focused primarily on alignment strategies for mapping time series data to text, while the choice of time series encoder architecture remains underexplored.

Method: The researchers conduct an exploratory study of hybrid architectures combining specialized time series encoders (including Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, and multilayer perceptron architectures) with a frozen LLM backbone. They evaluate how different encoder families perform when integrated with LLMs.

Result: Among all the evaluated encoder families (Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, and multilayer perceptron), the Inception model is the only encoder architecture that consistently yields positive performance gains when integrated with an LLM backbone.

Conclusion: The study shows that encoder choice significantly impacts hybrid LLM architectures for TSC, with Inception-based models emerging as a particularly promising direction for future LLM-driven time series learning due to their consistent positive performance gains.

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a core machine learning problem with broad applications. Recently there has been growing interest in repurposing large language models (LLMs) for TSC, motivated by their strong reasoning and generalization ability. Prior work has primarily focused on alignment strategies that explicitly map time series data into the textual domain; however, the choice of time series encoder architecture remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study of hybrid architectures that combine specialized time series encoders with a frozen LLM backbone. We evaluate a diverse set of encoder families, including Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, and multilayer perceptron architectures, among which the Inception model is the only encoder architecture that consistently yields positive performance gains when integrated with an LLM backbone. Overall, this study highlights the impact of time series encoder choice in hybrid LLM architectures and points to Inception-based models as a promising direction for future LLM-driven time series learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework for learning optimal transport maps without requiring gradient updates at inference time, enabling few-shot learning of transport operators from distribution pairs.

Method: Parameterizing a solution operator that learns to map pairs of distributions to OT maps using few-shot samples as prompts, with theoretical analysis in nonparametric (low-dimensional manifold) and parametric (e.g., Gaussian families) settings.

Result: Established theoretical scaling laws for generalization accuracy with prompt size, intrinsic dimension, and model capacity; provided explicit architectures for exact OT map recovery in parametric settings; validated framework experimentally on synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: In-context operator learning provides a promising gradient-free framework for optimal transport problems, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on both synthetic data and generative modeling benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce \emph{in-context operator learning on probability measure spaces} for optimal transport (OT). The goal is to learn a single solution operator that maps a pair of distributions to the OT map, using only few-shot samples from each distribution as a prompt and \emph{without} gradient updates at inference. We parameterize the solution operator and develop scaling-law theory in two regimes. In the \emph{nonparametric} setting, when tasks concentrate on a low-intrinsic-dimension manifold of source--target pairs, we establish generalization bounds that quantify how in-context accuracy scales with prompt size, intrinsic task dimension, and model capacity. In the \emph{parametric} setting (e.g., Gaussian families), we give an explicit architecture that recovers the exact OT map in context and provide finite-sample excess-risk bounds. Our numerical experiments on synthetic transports and generative-modeling benchmarks validate the framework.

*Tianqi Zhang,Flavio Ponzina,Tajana Rosing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FaTRQ is a far-memory-aware refinement system for ANNS that eliminates costly full-precision vector reads from storage by using tiered residual quantization and progressive distance estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern ANNS engines still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage (like SSDs), which dominates query latency for modern text and multimodal embeddings.

Method: FaTRQ uses tiered memory with progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory, tiered residual quantization encoding residuals as ternary values, and a custom accelerator deployed in CXL Type-2 device for low-latency refinement.

Result: FaTRQ improves storage efficiency by 2.4× and improves throughput by up to 9× compared to state-of-the-art GPU ANNS systems.

Conclusion: FaTRQ effectively addresses the storage bottleneck in ANNS refinement by eliminating the need to fetch full vectors from storage, significantly improving both storage efficiency and query throughput.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a key technique in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enabling rapid identification of the most relevant high-dimensional embeddings from massive vector databases. Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k. To support this, we propose tiered residual quantization, which encodes residuals as ternary values stored efficiently in far memory. A custom accelerator is deployed in a CXL Type-2 device to perform low-latency refinement locally. Together, FaTRQ improves the storage efficiency by 2.4$\times$ and improves the throughput by up to 9$ \times$ than SOTA GPU ANNS system.

*Peter Jemley*

TL;DR: Hybrid transformer using Neural ODE for continuous-depth layers enables real-time steering of generation attributes via learned control signals, achieving high control accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to standard transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable inference-time control over generation attributes in language models. Address limitations of standard transformers with fixed discrete layers that lack flexible control mechanisms during inference.

Method: Hybrid transformer architecture replacing discrete middle layers with a continuous-depth Neural ODE block. Depth is treated as a continuous variable governed by learned vector field F_θ(H, τ, u), with low-dimensional control signal u injected via concatenation. Training uses the adjoint method for O(1) memory regardless of integration depth.

Result: (1) Stable gradient flow with no exploding/vanishing gradients, (2) 98% accuracy for positive sentiment control and 88% for negative sentiment control, (3) 0.068% trajectory divergence showing continuous interpolation works, (4) Latency parity with standard discrete transformers. Adaptive solvers reveal control signal partitions vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature.

Conclusion: Continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals provide a viable, efficient mechanism for steerable language generation, offering inference-time control, efficient training via the adjoint method, and revealing meaningful geometric structure in learned dynamics.

Abstract: We present a hybrid transformer architecture that replaces discrete middle layers with a continuous-depth Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) block, enabling inference-time control over generation attributes via a learned steering signal. Unlike standard transformers that process representations through fixed discrete layers, our approach treats depth as a continuous variable governed by a learned vector field $F_θ(H, τ, u)$, where $u$ is a low-dimensional control signal injected via explicit concatenation. We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\%/88\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics. The adjoint method enables $O(1)$ memory training regardless of integration depth. Our results demonstrate that continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals provide a viable, efficient mechanism for steerable language generation.

*Yanhang Shi,Xiaoyu Wang,Houwei Cao,Jian Li,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PARSE is a multimodal decentralized federated learning framework using partial information decomposition to address gradient conflicts between uni- and multimodal agents through feature fission and partial alignment in server-free settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal decentralized federated learning faces challenges due to heterogeneous agents with different modalities and model architectures collaborating over P2P networks without central coordination. Standard multimodal pipelines using monolithic representations cause gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents, suppressing heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction.

Method: PARSE framework uses partial information decomposition (PID) with feature fission to split latent representations into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. It enables slice-level partial alignment for P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents, removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery.

Result: PARSE achieves consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines across benchmarks and agent mixes. Ablation studies on fusion operators and split ratios demonstrate the framework's efficiency and robustness, with qualitative visualizations confirming the approach.

Conclusion: PARSE provides an effective solution to the multimodal DFL problem by using PID-based feature fission and partial alignment, achieving superior performance while maintaining compatibility with standard DFL constraints.

Abstract: Multimodal decentralized federated learning (DFL) is challenging because agents differ in available modalities and model architectures, yet must collaborate over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks without a central coordinator. Standard multimodal pipelines learn a single shared embedding across all modalities. In DFL, such a monolithic representation induces gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents; as a result, it suppresses heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction. We present PARSE, a multimodal DFL framework that operationalizes partial information decomposition (PID) in a server-free setting. Each agent performs feature fission to factorize its latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents is enabled by slice-level partial alignment: only semantically shareable branches are exchanged among agents that possess the corresponding modality. By removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery, PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, thereby overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints. Across benchmarks and agent mixes, PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines. Ablations on fusion operators and split ratios, together with qualitative visualizations, further demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed design.

TL;DR: CAFEDistill addresses conflicts in personalized federated learning with early-exit networks through conflict-aware distillation, improving accuracy while reducing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PFL methods produce static models with fixed tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency, limiting applicability in dynamic inference environments. Early-exit networks offer adaptive inference but face challenges in federated settings due to client-wise heterogeneity and depth-wise interference from conflicting exit objectives.

Method: The proposed method is a progressive, depth-prioritized student coordination mechanism that includes a client-decoupled formulation to reduce communication overhead.

Result: CAFEDistill outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy and reducing inference costs by 30.79%-46.86%.

Conclusion: This paper provides an analysis of the abstract for 'CAFEDistill: Conflict-Aware Federated Exit Distillation framework'.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) enables collaboratively model training on decentralized, heterogeneous data while tailoring them to each client's unique distribution. However, existing PFL methods produce static models with a fixed tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, limiting their applicability in environments where inference requirements vary with contexts and resource availability. Early-exit networks (EENs) offer adaptive inference by attaching intermediate classifiers. Yet integrating them into PFL is challenging due to client-wise heterogeneity and depth-wise interference arising from conflicting exit objectives. Prior studies fail to resolve both conflicts simultaneously, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose CAFEDistill, a Conflict-Aware Federated Exit Distillation framework that jointly addresses these conflicts and extends PFL to early-exit networks. Through a progressive, depth-prioritized student coordination mechanism, CAFEDistill mitigates interference among shallow and deep exits while allowing effective personalized knowledge transfer across clients. Furthermore, it reduces communication overhead via a client-decoupled formulation. Extensive evaluations show that CAFEDistill outperforms the state-of-the-arts, achieving higher accuracy and reducing inference costs by 30.79%-46.86%.

TL;DR: Time aggregation features like trailing and event count windows in XGBoost models improve CTR prediction on Avazu dataset, with trailing windows as a practical default.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance click-through rate prediction by exploring time aggregation features under strict out-of-time splits and no-lookahead constraints.

Method: Compare time-aware target encoding baseline with models augmented by entity history time aggregation using various window designs (trailing, event count, gap, bucketized).

Result: Trailing windows improve ROC AUC by 0.0066 to 0.0082 and PR AUC by 0.0084 to 0.0094 over baseline; event count windows provide small additional gains; gap and bucketized windows underperform.

Conclusion: Trailing windows are recommended as a default, with event count windows as optional for marginal ROC AUC improvements.

Abstract: This paper studies time aggregation features for XGBoost models in click-through rate prediction. The setting is the Avazu click-through rate prediction dataset with strict out-of-time splits and a no-lookahead feature constraint. Features for hour H use only impressions from hours strictly before H. This paper compares a strong time-aware target encoding baseline to models augmented with entity history time aggregation under several window designs. Across two rolling-tail folds on a deterministic ten percent sample, a trailing window specification improves ROC AUC by about 0.0066 to 0.0082 and PR AUC by about 0.0084 to 0.0094 relative to target encoding alone. Within the time aggregation design grid, event count windows provide the only consistent improvement over trailing windows, and the gain is small. Gap windows and bucketized windows underperform simple trailing windows in this dataset and protocol. These results support a practical default of trailing windows, with an optional event count window when marginal ROC AUC gains matter.

### [71] [BPE: Behavioral Profiling Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10024)
*Yanxin Liu,Yunqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BPE framework introduces 'behavioral profiles' for models to compute ensemble weights based on deviation from intrinsic behavior, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy, efficiency, and resource utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble methods (static like Stacking and dynamic like DES) have limitations: static methods treat models holistically without considering their varying competence across different instance regions, while both static and dynamic approaches rely on inter-model divergence. They neglect intrinsic model characteristics and require heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation.

Method: BPE constructs a 'behavioral profile' intrinsic to each model, capturing its characteristic response patterns across the instance space. Integration weights are derived based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile, measured independently of other models or validation sets.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines. Gains are evident in predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and storage resource utilization across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Behavioral Profiling Ensemble framework offers a more effective and efficient alternative to traditional ensemble methods by shifting from inter-model divergence to intra-model behavioral consistency. It represents a fundamental advance in ensemble learning methodology with practical benefits across multiple dimensions.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is widely recognized as a pivotal strategy for pushing the boundaries of predictive performance. Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from the BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines. These gains are evident not only in predictive accuracy but also in computational efficiency and storage resource utilization across various scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Augmented ICL uses labeled + unlabeled data in prompts, enabling transformers to emulate EM algorithms for better performance with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have impressive ICL capabilities but are limited by few labeled demonstrations that fit in prompts. There's vast unlabeled data that could enhance ICL performance, but how to utilize it provably is an open question.

Method: Proposes an augmented ICL framework where prompts include labeled examples plus unlabeled inputs. Uses chain-of-thought prompting and shows transformers can emulate EM algorithms for multi-class linear classification. Also provides theoretical analysis of transformer training convergence.

Result: The augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL. Theoretical analysis shows transformers can emulate EM algorithms and their parameters converge linearly during teacher forcing training.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that augmented ICL with both labeled and unlabeled data significantly improves upon conventional few-shot ICL, and provides the first theoretical analysis of how unlabeled data affects transformer ICL performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, yet the quality of their predictions is fundamentally limited by the few costly labeled demonstrations that can fit into a prompt. Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy. Moreover, we show that such a transformer can be trained via teacher forcing, with its parameters converging to the desired solution at a linear rate. Experiments demonstrate that the augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study on the impact of unlabeled data on the ICL performance of transformers.

*Hung Vinh Tran,Tong Chen,Hechuan Wen,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Bin Cui,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NaCS is a noise-aware coreset selection framework for content-based recommendation systems that creates efficient, high-quality coresets while handling noisy interactions, achieving near-full performance with just 1% of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Content-based recommendation systems require large-scale continuous training to accommodate diverse user preferences, leading to high computational costs. Additionally, the small coresets typically used for efficiency are vulnerable to noise in user-item interactions.

Method: The method involves: 1) constructing coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, 2) simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model, and 3) refining the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification.

Result: Extensive experiments show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1% of the training data.

Conclusion: NaCS effectively addresses the challenges of computational costs and noise in content-based recommendation systems by creating high-quality coresets that maintain 93-95% of full-dataset performance with only 1% of training data.

Abstract: Content-based recommendation systems (CRSs) utilize content features to predict user-item interactions, serving as essential tools for helping users navigate information-rich web services. However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\% of the training data.

### [74] [Comparative Evaluation of Deep Learning-Based and WHO-Informed Approaches for Sperm Morphology Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10070)
*Mohammad Abbadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) outperforms traditional WHO criteria augmented with an inflammation index in objectively assessing sperm morphology, showing better discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current assessment of sperm morphological quality is a critical but subjective component of male fertility evaluation. It is often limited by inter-observer variability and resource constraints. There is a need for more objective and reliable tools to improve predictive reliability and clinical utility.

Method: The study developed a comparative biomedical AI framework. An image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated on an independent clinical cohort. Performance was compared against a clinically grounded baseline: WHO criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)). Evaluation included discrimination (AUC-ROC, precision-recall), calibration analysis, and clinical utility analysis via decision curve analysis.

Result: The HuSHeM model demonstrated superior performance compared to the WHO(+SIRI) baseline. It showed higher discriminative performance (increased AUC-ROC with narrow confidence intervals), improved performance under class imbalance (higher precision-recall area), better calibration (closer agreement between predicted and observed outcomes), and greater net clinical benefit across relevant probability thresholds.

Conclusion: The study proposes an AI-driven framework using the HuSHeM model for sperm morphology assessment. The model outperforms traditional WHO criteria augmented with inflammation markers in discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. The framework supports objective, reproducible assessment as a decision-support or referral tool, but is not intended to replace clinical judgment or laboratory testing.

Abstract: Assessment of sperm morphological quality remains a critical yet subjective component of male fertility evaluation, often limited by inter-observer variability and resource constraints. This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).
  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.
  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria. The proposed framework supports objective and reproducible assessment of sperm morphology and may serve as a decision-support tool within fertility screening and referral workflows. The proposed models are intended as decision-support or referral tools and are not designed to replace clinical judgment or laboratory assessment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse-RL enables stable reinforcement learning training with compressed KV caches by addressing policy mismatch issues through sparsity-aware rejection sampling and importance reweighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL is essential for complex reasoning in LLMs, but memory overhead from KV caches during long rollouts limits training on limited hardware. Existing KV compression techniques cause policy mismatch and performance collapse when applied to RL training.

Method: Sparse-RL addresses instability from policy mismatch among dense old policy, sparse sampler policy, and learner policy. It uses Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct off-policy bias from compression-induced information loss.

Result: Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving performance. It also implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.

Conclusion: Sparse-RL provides an effective solution for stable RL training under sparse rollouts by mitigating policy mismatch issues, enabling efficient training on limited hardware while maintaining performance and improving robustness for sparse inference.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become essential for eliciting complex reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance. Furthermore, Sparse-RL inherently implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.

*Zan Chaudhry,Noam H. Rotenberg,Brian Caffo,Craig K. Jones,Haris I. Sair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALED is a novel label error detection method that uses neural network features, manifold modeling, and likelihood testing to identify mislabeled data with improved sensitivity and precision, leading to substantial model performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning classification systems are vulnerable to performance degradation when trained with incorrectly labeled data, even when annotated by experts. As machine learning becomes more prevalent, there is a growing need to identify and correct label errors to develop more powerful and reliable models.

Method: ALED extracts intermediate features from a deep convolutional neural network, denoises these features, models each class's reduced manifold as a multidimensional Gaussian distribution, and performs a likelihood ratio test to identify mislabeled samples.

Result: ALED demonstrates significantly higher sensitivity without compromising precision compared to established label error detection methods across multiple medical imaging datasets. Fine-tuning a neural network on corrected data using ALED results in a 33.8% reduction in test set errors.

Conclusion: ALED offers an effective solution for detecting mislabeled data with improved sensitivity and precision, leading to substantial performance gains when models are fine-tuned on corrected data, making it valuable for practical machine learning applications where data quality is critical.

Abstract: Machine learning classification systems are susceptible to poor performance when trained with incorrect ground truth labels, even when data is well-curated by expert annotators. As machine learning becomes more widespread, it is increasingly imperative to identify and correct mislabeling to develop more powerful models. In this work, we motivate and describe Adaptive Label Error Detection (ALED), a novel method of detecting mislabeling. ALED extracts an intermediate feature space from a deep convolutional neural network, denoises the features, models the reduced manifold of each class with a multidimensional Gaussian distribution, and performs a simple likelihood ratio test to identify mislabeled samples. We show that ALED has markedly increased sensitivity, without compromising precision, compared to established label error detection methods, on multiple medical imaging datasets. We demonstrate an example where fine-tuning a neural network on corrected data results in a 33.8% decrease in test set errors, providing strong benefits to end users. The ALED detector is deployed in the Python package statlab.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian approach addresses missing key variable bias in medical meta-analyses, demonstrated with TOLAC decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-analyses in medicine often fail when crucial decision variables impacting physician choices are not captured, leading to unknown effect sizes and unreliable conclusions.

Method: Developed a Bayesian approach to handle missing key variables in medical studies, specifically applied to Trial of Labor After Cesarean-section (TOLAC) scenarios with OBGYN professionals.

Result: The Bayesian approach provides support for physicians to make informed decisions in TOLAC situations where few interventions are available, advancing patient care.

Conclusion: Bayesian methods can overcome limitations of traditional meta-analyses when key variables are missing, enabling more reliable clinical decision-making in complex medical scenarios.

Abstract: The meta-analysis's utility is dependent on previous studies having accurately captured the variables of interest, but in medical studies, a key decision variable that impacts a physician's decisions was not captured. This results in an unknown effect size and unreliable conclusions. A Bayesian approach may allow analysis to determine if the claim of a positive effect is still warranted, and we build a Bayesian approach to this common medical scenario. To demonstrate its utility, we assist professional OBGYNs in evaluating Trial of Labor After a Cesarean-section (TOLAC) situations where few interventions are available for patients and find the support needed for physicians to advance patient care.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LeMoF: A level-guided modal fusion framework that selectively integrates representations from different encoder layers to improve multimodal clinical prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal clinical prediction methods rely on static modality integration schemes and simple fusion strategies, which fail to fully exploit modality-specific representations and struggle with heterogeneous clinical data.

Method: LeMoF (Level-guided Modal Fusion) - a novel framework that selectively integrates level-guided representations within each modality, where each level corresponds to representations from different encoder layers. The method explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations.

Result: Experiments on length of stay prediction using ICU data show that LeMoF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques across various encoder configurations.

Conclusion: Level-wise integration is crucial for achieving robust predictive performance across diverse clinical conditions, and LeMoF provides a promising approach for multimodal clinical prediction that balances prediction stability and discriminative capability.

Abstract: Multimodal clinical prediction is widely used to integrate heterogeneous data such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) and biosignals. However, existing methods tend to rely on static modality integration schemes and simple fusion strategies. As a result, they fail to fully exploit modality-specific representations. In this paper, we propose Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), a novel framework that selectively integrates level-guided representations within each modality. Each level refers to a representation extracted from a different layer of the encoder. LeMoF explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations. This design enables LeMoF to achieve a balanced performance between prediction stability and discriminative capability even in heterogeneous clinical environments. Experiments on length of stay prediction using Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data demonstrate that LeMoF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques across various encoder configurations. We also confirmed that level-wise integration is a key factor in achieving robust predictive performance across various clinical conditions.

TL;DR: METAL is a lightweight method that uses English text alone to align multilingual text with multimodal space, achieving strong zero-shot performance in multilingual retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models perform well in English but poorly in other languages due to limited multilingual multimodal resources; existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation and underutilize advances in multilingual text modeling.

Method: A lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text to map multilingual text embeddings into multimodal space.

Result: METAL matches baseline English performance (94.9% Recall@10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5% Recall@10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval; generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: METAL demonstrates that lightweight alignment with English text alone can effectively map multilingual text into multimodal space, achieving strong multilingual performance and generalizing across modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal models excel in English, supported by abundant image-text and audio-text data, but performance drops sharply for other languages due to limited multilingual multimodal resources. Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations. Beyond image-text retrieval, METAL generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual text-to-image generation. We release code and checkpoints at https://github.com/m2m-codebase/M2M , as well as multilingual evaluation datasets including MSCOCO Multilingual 30K (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/mscoco-multilingual-30k ), AudioCaps Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/audiocaps-multilingual ), and Clotho Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/clotho-multilingual ), to facilitate further research.

TL;DR: Tree-Query: Tree-structured multi-expert LLM framework for interpretable, confidence-aware pairwise causal discovery with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical constraint-based methods suffer from error propagation, and recent LLM-based causal oracles often behave as opaque, confidence-free black boxes, creating a need for interpretable, confidence-aware causal discovery frameworks.

Method: Tree-Query reduces pairwise causal discovery to a short sequence of queries about backdoor paths, (in)dependence, latent confounding, and causal direction, yielding interpretable judgments with robustness-aware confidence scores.

Result: On data-free benchmarks, Tree-Query improves structural metrics over direct LLM baselines, and a diet--weight case study illustrates confounder screening and stable, high-confidence causal conclusions.

Conclusion: Tree-Query offers a principled way to obtain data-free causal priors from LLMs that can complement downstream data-driven causal discovery.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover ``what causes what'', but classical constraint-based methods (e.g., PC, FCI) suffer from error propagation, and recent LLM-based causal oracles often behave as opaque, confidence-free black boxes. This paper introduces Tree-Query, a tree-structured, multi-expert LLM framework that reduces pairwise causal discovery to a short sequence of queries about backdoor paths, (in)dependence, latent confounding, and causal direction, yielding interpretable judgments with robustness-aware confidence scores. Theoretical guarantees are provided for asymptotic identifiability of four pairwise relations. On data-free benchmarks derived from Mooij et al. and UCI causal graphs, Tree-Query improves structural metrics over direct LLM baselines, and a diet--weight case study illustrates confounder screening and stable, high-confidence causal conclusions. Tree-Query thus offers a principled way to obtain data-free causal priors from LLMs that can complement downstream data-driven causal discovery.

TL;DR: SPF is a lightweight fine-tuning method that preserves safety alignment by removing gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace, maintaining both utility and safety even during deep fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs for downstream tasks often degrades safety alignment, creating a persistent safety-utility dilemma where emphasizing safety compromises task performance, while prioritizing utility leads to safety decline.

Method: The authors propose Safety-Preserving Fine-tuning (SPF), which identifies that safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace while utility gradients span a broader space. SPF efficiently estimates the dominant safety direction from a single sample and removes gradient components conflicting with this safety subspace during fine-tuning.

Result: SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance while recovering nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. It exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: The work provides new mechanistic understanding of gradient interactions in safety-aligned LLMs and offers practical guidance for always-aligned fine-tuning through the lightweight SPF approach that guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an essential and pervasive functionality for applying large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.
  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new contrastive learning method called SNGCL for node classification that uses multilayer Laplace smoothing filters and improved triplet loss to address issues with existing graph contrastive learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning for graph data faces two main challenges: 1) existing data augmentation techniques can create views too different from the original, weakening relevance and training efficiency, and 2) most graph contrastive learning algorithms rely heavily on large numbers of negative samples.

Method: SNGCL uses superimposed multilayer Laplace smoothing filters to obtain global and local feature smoothing matrices, which are fed into siamese network's target and online networks. It then employs an improved triplet recombination loss function to minimize intra-class distance and maximize inter-class distance.

Result: SNGCL shows strong competitiveness compared to state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, performing well in most tasks.

Conclusion: SNGCL is an effective contrastive learning method for node classification that addresses key limitations of existing approaches through improved view generation and loss function design.

Abstract: The effectiveness of contrastive learning methods has been widely recognized in the field of graph learning, especially in contexts where graph data often lack labels or are difficult to label. However, the application of these methods to node classification tasks still faces a number of challenges. First, existing data enhancement techniques may lead to significant differences from the original view when generating new views, which may weaken the relevance of the view and affect the efficiency of model training. Second, the vast majority of existing graph comparison learning algorithms rely on the use of a large number of negative samples. To address the above challenges, this study proposes a novel node classification contrast learning method called Simple Network Graph Comparative Learning (SNGCL). Specifically, SNGCL employs a superimposed multilayer Laplace smoothing filter as a step in processing the data to obtain global and local feature smoothing matrices, respectively, which are thus passed into the target and online networks of the siamese network, and finally employs an improved triple recombination loss function to bring the intra-class distance closer and the inter-class distance farther. We have compared SNGCL with state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, and the experimental results show that SNGCL is strongly competitive in most tasks.

TL;DR: LOOKAT compresses KV cache using product quantization and lookup tables to enable efficient deployment of large language models on edge devices, achieving over 64x compression with high output fidelity and no architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce bandwidth and allow deployment of large language models on edge devices by overcoming the limitation where existing quantization methods compress storage but fail to reduce bandwidth during attention calculation.

Method: Applies product quantization and asymmetric distance computation to transformer architecture by decomposing key vectors into subspaces, learning codebooks, and computing attention tables via lookup tables, transforming attention from memory-bound to compute-bound.

Result: Achieves 64x compression at 95.7% output fidelity and 32x compression at 95.0% fidelity on GPT-2, with no architecture changes or training required, maintaining rank correlation ρ > 0.95.

Conclusion: LOOKAT effectively reduces KV cache size and attention bandwidth to support large language models on edge devices, offering a high compression ratio, strong theoretical guarantees, and experimental validation.

Abstract: Compressing the KV cache is a required step to deploy large language models on edge devices. Current quantization methods compress storage but fail to reduce bandwidth as attention calculation requires dequantizing keys from INT4/INT8 to FP16 before use. We observe that attention scoring is mathematically equivalent to the inner product similarity search and we can apply some compression techniques from vector databases to compress KV-cache better. We propose LOOKAT, which applies product quantization and asymmetric distance computation, to transformer architecture by decomposing key vectors into subspaces, learning codebooks and computing attention tables via lookup tables. This transforms attention from memory-bound to compute-bound. LOOKAT achieves 64 $\times$ compression at 95.7\% output fidelity and 32 $\times$ compression at 95.0\% fidelity when tested on GPT-2. LOOKAT requires no architecture changes or training while maintaining rank correlation $ρ> 0.95$. Theoretical analysis confirms that rank correlation degrades as $O(d_k/mK)$, with guarantees validated across sequence lengths up to 1024 tokens.

TL;DR: Proposes CC-OR-Net, a unified framework for LTV prediction with structural decomposition to address zero-inflated and long-tail data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction faces challenges from zero-inflated and long-tail distributions, where most users have low-to-medium values, overwhelming high-value 'whales', and value heterogeneity exists within lower-value groups.

Method: Introduces Conditional Cascaded Ordinal-Residual Networks (CC-OR-Net) with structural decomposition, including a structural ordinal decomposition module for ranking, an intra-bucket residual module for regression, and a targeted high-value augmentation module for precision on top-tier users.

Result: CC-OR-Net achieves a superior trade-off across key business metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets with over 300M users.

Conclusion: CC-OR-Net provides a holistic and commercially valuable LTV prediction solution by robustly decoupling ranking and regression through architectural design, effectively balancing global accuracy with high-value precision.

Abstract: Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction, a central problem in modern marketing, is characterized by a unique zero-inflated and long-tail data distribution. This distribution presents two fundamental challenges: (1) the vast majority of low-to-medium value users numerically overwhelm the small but critically important segment of high-value "whale" users, and (2) significant value heterogeneity exists even within the low-to-medium value user base. Common approaches either rely on rigid statistical assumptions or attempt to decouple ranking and regression using ordered buckets; however, they often enforce ordinality through loss-based constraints rather than inherent architectural design, failing to balance global accuracy with high-value precision. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{C}ascaded \textbf{O}rdinal-\textbf{R}esidual Networks \textbf{(CC-OR-Net)}, a novel unified framework that achieves a more robust decoupling through \textbf{structural decomposition}, where ranking is architecturally guaranteed. CC-OR-Net integrates three specialized components: a \textit{structural ordinal decomposition module} for robust ranking, an \textit{intra-bucket residual module} for fine-grained regression, and a \textit{targeted high-value augmentation module} for precision on top-tier users. Evaluated on real-world datasets with over 300M users, CC-OR-Net achieves a superior trade-off across all key business metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in creating a holistic and commercially valuable LTV prediction solution.

*Chuyi Wang,Xiaohui Xie,Tongze Wang,Yong Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiasSeeker is a model-agnostic, data-driven framework that detects dataset-specific shortcut features in encrypted traffic via statistical correlation analysis, reducing bias and improving generalization in traffic classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained models for encrypted network traffic classification often suffer from shortcut learning, relying on spurious correlations that fail to generalize to real-world data. Existing solutions lack adaptability and generality across different model architectures and deployment scenarios.

Method: BiasSeeker performs statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic to identify spurious or environment-entangled features, independent of any classifier. It introduces a systematic categorization of shortcut features and applies category-specific validation strategies to reduce bias while preserving meaningful information.

Result: BiasSeeker was evaluated on 19 public datasets across three network traffic classification tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying shortcut features and improving generalization through context-aware feature selection.

Conclusion: BiasSeeker introduces a model-agnostic, data-driven framework for detecting dataset-specific shortcut features in encrypted traffic classification, emphasizing context-aware feature selection as a critical, intentional step before model training to improve generalization.

Abstract: Pre-trained models operating directly on raw bytes have achieved promising performance in encrypted network traffic classification (NTC), but often suffer from shortcut learning-relying on spurious correlations that fail to generalize to real-world data. Existing solutions heavily rely on model-specific interpretation techniques, which lack adaptability and generality across different model architectures and deployment scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose BiasSeeker, the first semi-automated framework that is both model-agnostic and data-driven for detecting dataset-specific shortcut features in encrypted traffic. By performing statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic, BiasSeeker identifies spurious or environment-entangled features that may compromise generalization, independent of any classifier. To address the diverse nature of shortcut features, we introduce a systematic categorization and apply category-specific validation strategies that reduce bias while preserving meaningful information.
  We evaluate BiasSeeker on 19 public datasets across three NTC tasks. By emphasizing context-aware feature selection and dataset-specific diagnosis, BiasSeeker offers a novel perspective for understanding and addressing shortcut learning in encrypted network traffic classification, raising awareness that feature selection should be an intentional and scenario-sensitive step prior to model training.

*Kiattikun Chobtham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning approach using Deep Q-Networks to optimize a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction in Thailand.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a significant gap in local-scale climate indices for improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand, despite global climate indices being standard for long-term rainfall prediction.

Method: Introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index from sea surface temperature, uses Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning to optimize calculated areas, clusters rainfall stations into 12 patterns, and incorporates optimized index into Long Short-Term Memory models.

Result: Incorporating the optimized index significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas and effectively reduces Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning approach successfully creates an effective local-scale climate index that enhances rainfall prediction accuracy in Thailand, addressing the gap between global indices and regional needs.

Abstract: Climate prediction is a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal patterns within Earth systems. Global climate indices, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.

*Antonio Briola,Marwin Schmidt,Fabio Caccioli,Carlos Ros Perez,James Singleton,Christian Michler,Tomaso Aste*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-regularized PCA method that incorporates feature dependencies through sparse precision graphs and graph Laplacian penalties to produce interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data often violate PCA's isotropic noise assumption, with features that are not independent and identically distributed. Existing PCA variants don't effectively incorporate conditional dependency structures among features.

Method: Graph regularization of PCA that incorporates a sparse precision graph and penalizes loadings using graph Laplacian to favor low-frequency Fourier modes. The method suppresses high-frequency signals while preserving graph-coherent low-frequency ones.

Result: GR-PCA concentrates variance on intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction, and prevents overfitting when high-frequency signals are present. It outperforms PCA when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated.

Conclusion: GR-PCA provides an effective, practical approach for structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity of components while maintaining competitive reconstruction performance. It performs best when data exhibit graph-dependent high-frequency signals.

Abstract: High-dimensional data often exhibit dependencies among variables that violate the isotropic-noise assumption under which principal component analysis (PCA) is optimal. For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.

### [88] [PRL: Process Reward Learning Improves LLMs' Reasoning Ability and Broadens the Reasoning Boundary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10201)
*Jiarui Yao,Ruida Wang,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Process Reward Learning (PRL) provides theoretical process supervision for LLM reasoning optimization, improving performance metrics without complex additional training steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to improving LLM reasoning abilities rely on trajectory-level outcome rewards, lacking fine-grained process supervision. Existing frameworks using process signals require complex additional steps like MCTS or separate reward models, and lack theoretical foundation for process signal design.

Method: The authors propose Process Reward Learning (PRL) which decomposes entropy regularized RL objectives into intermediate steps with theoretically derived process rewards. The formulation is equivalent to reward maximization plus KL-divergence penalty between policy and reference models, turning outcome rewards into process supervision signals.

Result: PRL improves LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n metrics and broadens reasoning boundaries as shown by improved pass @ n metrics. Extensive experiments verify and generalize the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: Process Reward Learning (PRL) effectively improves LLM reasoning capabilities by providing theoretical grounded process supervision, reducing reliance on complex additional steps while enhancing both average performance and reasoning boundary as demonstrated in extensive experiments.

Abstract: Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.

*Murat Bilgehan Ertan,Marten van Dijk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-SGD has inherent privacy-utility trade-off limitations under worst-case adversaries that cannot be overcome without substantial accuracy degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental limitations of DP-SGD under worst-case adversarial privacy definitions, which remain poorly understood despite being the dominant private training paradigm.

Method: Theoretical analysis of DP-SGD in f-DP framework with shuffled sampling over single epoch, deriving explicit bounds on achievable privacy trade-off curves.

Result: Proved that enforcing small privacy separation requires large Gaussian noise multipliers, showing DP-SGD cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility under standard adversarial models. Derived explicit bounds connecting noise level σ and privacy separation κ.

Conclusion: DP-SGD has a fundamental utility-privacy trade-off limitation under worst-case adversarial models, which presents a critical bottleneck for practical differentially private training.

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is the dominant paradigm for private training, but its fundamental limitations under worst-case adversarial privacy definitions remain poorly understood. We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $κ$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $κ$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $σ$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy
  $σ\ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\ln M}}$ $\quad\text{or}\quad$ $κ\ge\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{8}}\!\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{4π\ln M}}\right)$,
  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \to \infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.

### [90] [X-SAM: Boosting Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Dominant-Eigenvector Gradient Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10251)
*Hongru Duan,Yongle Chen,Lei Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-SAM improves Sharpness-Aware Minimization by correcting gradient direction using Hessian eigenvectors to achieve more effective sharpness regularization and better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's gradient may sometimes point toward sharp regions instead of flat ones, failing to achieve intended sharpness regularization, which creates a gap between theoretical expectations and practical optimization behavior.

Method: Analyze SAM from spectral/geometric perspective using angle between gradient and Hessian's leading eigenvector as sharpness measure. Propose X-SAM that corrects gradient via orthogonal decomposition along top eigenvector for more direct regularization of Hessian's maximum eigenvalue.

Result: Theoretical proof of X-SAM's convergence and superior generalization. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm both theoretical and practical advantages over standard SAM.

Conclusion: X-SAM addresses limitations of SAM by explicitly aligning gradients with Hessian eigenvectors, providing more effective sharpness regularization and improved generalization performance.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) aims to improve generalization by minimizing a worst-case perturbed loss over a small neighborhood of model parameters. However, during training, its optimization behavior does not always align with theoretical expectations, since both sharp and flat regions may yield a small perturbed loss. In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue. We prove X-SAM's convergence and superior generalization, with extensive experimental evaluations confirming both theoretical and practical advantages.

TL;DR: Receiver-side In-Context Decoding (ICD) framework enhances SSCC robustness against cliff effects by using bit reliability and LLM-based decoding without transmitter modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSCC suffers from catastrophic cliff effects in low SNR regimes where residual bit errors break lossless source decoding, especially problematic for LLM-driven Arithmetic Coding.

Method: An ICD framework with Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) for bit-wise reliability, reliability-guided bit flipping for candidate pool construction, LLM-based arithmetic decoding with sequence-level log-likelihoods, and reliability-likelihood fusion rule for final output selection.

Result: Extensive experiments over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate consistent gains over conventional SSCC baselines and representative JSCC schemes, with theoretical guarantees on stability and convergence of the sampling procedure.

Conclusion: The receiver-side In-Context Decoding framework effectively addresses the cliff effect in SSCC systems, providing practical performance gains and theoretical guarantees while maintaining compatibility with existing transmitters and strong channel codes.

Abstract: Separate Source-Channel Coding (SSCC) remains attractive for text transmission due to its modularity and compatibility with mature entropy coders and powerful channel codes. However, SSCC often suffers from a pronounced cliff effect in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes, where residual bit errors after channel decoding can catastrophically break lossless source decoding, especially for Arithmetic Coding (AC) driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper proposes a receiver-side In-Context Decoding (ICD) framework that enhances SSCC robustness without modifying the transmitter. ICD leverages an Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) to obtain bit-wise reliability for the decoded information bits. Based on the context-consistent bitstream, ICD constructs a confidence-ranked candidate pool via reliability-guided bit flipping, samples a compact yet diverse subset of candidates, and applies an LLM-based arithmetic decoder to obtain both reconstructions and sequence-level log-likelihoods. A reliability-likelihood fusion rule then selects the final output. We further provide theoretical guarantees on the stability and convergence of the proposed sampling procedure. Extensive experiments over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate consistent gains compared with conventional SSCC baselines and representative Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes.

Motivation: Develop an unsupervised health-monitoring framework for turbofan engines that doesn't require run-to-failure labels, enabling quicker deployment and scalability across diverse fleets.

Method: Unsupervised framework using regression-based normalization to remove operating-condition effects, followed by training an LSTM autoencoder only on healthy portions of trajectories, with adaptive data-driven threshold for persistent reconstruction error detection.

Conclusion: The method can be deployed quickly, scale to diverse fleets, and serve as a complementary early-warning layer to Remaining Useful Life models.

Abstract: This paper introduces an unsupervised health-monitoring framework for turbofan engines that does not require run-to-failure labels. First, operating-condition effects in NASA CMAPSS sensor streams are removed via regression-based normalisation; then a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder is trained only on the healthy portion of each trajectory. Persistent reconstruction error, estimated using an adaptive data-driven threshold, triggers real-time alerts without hand-tuned rules. Benchmark results show high recall and low false-alarm rates across multiple operating regimes, demonstrating that the method can be deployed quickly, scale to diverse fleets, and serve as a complementary early-warning layer to Remaining Useful Life models.

TL;DR: Optimal allocation of thinking tokens across task types in an LLM server queueing system to maximize accuracy while controlling latency under stability constraints, with efficient computation methods and rounding analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the accuracy-latency trade-off in LLM serving systems where heterogeneous queries require different computational effort (thinking tokens), optimizing token allocation across task types under queueing stability constraints.

Method: Formulated a constrained optimization problem maximizing weighted accuracy penalized by mean system time, derived first-order optimality conditions yielding a coupled projected fixed-point characterization, developed iterative solution and contraction condition, and implemented projected gradient method with global step-size bound.

Result: Established strict concavity of objective ensuring unique optimal token allocation; derived fixed-point characterization and iterative solution with contraction guarantee; developed projected gradient method for convergence beyond contractive regime; integer rounding yields minimal performance loss in simulations.

Conclusion: The optimal token allocation can be efficiently computed via fixed-point iteration or projected gradient methods, with rounding to integer values causing minimal performance loss, demonstrating practical viability.

Abstract: We consider a single large language model (LLM) server that serves a heterogeneous stream of queries belonging to $N$ distinct task types. Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.

TL;DR: SPIKE regularizes PINNs with Koopman operators to learn sparse dynamics representations, improving generalization and stability for extrapolation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-Informed Neural Networks tend to overfit within training domains and generalize poorly when extrapolating beyond trained spatiotemporal regions. There's a need to improve PINN generalization capabilities while maintaining their mesh-free advantages.

Method: The proposed SPIKE framework embeds continuous-time Koopman operators into PINN training, enforcing linear dynamics dz/dt = Az in a learned observable space. The approach includes both standard regularization (PIKE) and L1-sparsity regularization (SPIKE) to learn parsimonious generator matrices.

Result: Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs (including Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz) show consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy compared to standard PINNs.

Conclusion: SPIKE provides a principled regularization framework that improves PINN generalization through Koopman operator constraints, offering better extrapolation and long-term stability without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free approach for solving differential equations by embedding physical constraints into neural network training. However, PINNs tend to overfit within the training domain, leading to poor generalization when extrapolating beyond trained spatiotemporal regions. This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations. By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy. The continuous-time formulation with matrix exponential integration provides unconditional stability for stiff systems while avoiding diagonal dominance issues inherent in discrete-time Koopman operators.

TL;DR: DualCD is a lightweight dual-causal disentanglement framework that improves time series classification in domain incremental learning by separating causal features and eliminating confounding influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series classification methods struggle with domain incremental learning scenarios where models need to adapt to new domains while retaining knowledge from previous ones.

Method: DualCD uses a temporal feature disentanglement module to separate class-causal features and spurious features, plus a dual-causal intervention mechanism that constructs variant samples to eliminate confounding effects from intra-class and inter-class features.

Result: Extensive experiments show DualCD significantly improves performance in domain incremental scenarios across multiple datasets and models, and the framework can be integrated into various time series classification models.

Conclusion: DualCD provides an effective framework for domain incremental time series classification through causal disentanglement and intervention mechanisms, offering a valuable benchmark for future research in this area.

Abstract: The World Wide Web thrives on intelligent services that rely on accurate time series classification, which has recently witnessed significant progress driven by advances in deep learning. However, existing studies face challenges in domain incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and robust dual-causal disentanglement framework (DualCD) to enhance the robustness of models under domain incremental scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into time series classification models. Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that DualCD effectively improves performance in domain incremental scenarios. We summarize our rich experiments into a comprehensive benchmark to facilitate research in domain incremental time series classification.

TL;DR: Proposes MetaDG framework that uses dynamic graph modeling to unify spatio-temporal dynamics and heterogeneity capture for more accurate traffic flow prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations in existing traffic prediction methods where: 1) dynamics modeling is limited to spatial topology changes rather than broader scope, and 2) spatio-temporal heterogeneity is modeled separately rather than unified. The goal is to better capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies for more accurate traffic flow prediction.

Method: Provides a novel Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG) framework that leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to model spatio-temporal dynamics. It generates dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending modeling beyond topology and unifying spatio-temporal heterogeneity capture into a single dimension.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MetaDG, demonstrating its capability to improve traffic prediction performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The MetaDG framework successfully addresses key limitations in traffic prediction by unifying spatio-temporal dynamics modeling and heterogeneity capture through a dynamic graph approach, demonstrating superior performance across multiple real-world datasets.

Abstract: Traffic flow prediction is a typical spatio-temporal prediction problem and has a wide range of applications. The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MetaDG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitation of traditional curiosity-driven methods in reinforcement learning that rely solely on state prediction error. The authors aim to develop a more nuanced intrinsic motivation framework that incorporates strategy-based novelty signals to improve exploration.

Method: The method introduces two complementary components: Strategy Stability (SS) which measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, and Strategy Surprise (SuS) which captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. The combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients. The approach is evaluated on mathematical reasoning tasks using large language models.

Result: The results demonstrate significant improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity. SuS achieves 17.4% improvement in Pass@1 and 26.4% improvement in Pass@5 compared to baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that removing either component results in at least 10% performance degradation, validating the synergistic nature of the approach. The framework maintains higher strategy diversity throughout training.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Strategy-aware Surprise (SuS) framework successfully enhances exploration in reinforcement learning by integrating strategy-based novelty signals, outperforming traditional curiosity-driven methods and improving both accuracy and solution diversity in mathematical reasoning tasks.

*Mesut Ceylan,Alexis Tabin,Patrick Langer,Elgar Fleisch,Filipe Barata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoMorph is an evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible counterfactual explanations for continuous biomedical time series, addressing limitations of existing methods for time-series extrinsic regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series extrinsic regression models increasingly use PPG signals for clinical assessments, but single point estimates alone are insufficient for clinical trust. Existing counterfactual explanation methods are limited to classification, ignore waveform morphology, and produce implausible signals for continuous biomedical time series.

Method: EvoMorph uses a multi-objective evolutionary framework with morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors, applying transformations to preserve waveform structure while generating diverse counterfactual explanations.

Result: EvoMorph was evaluated on three PPG datasets for heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, outperforming nearest-unlike-neighbor baselines. It also demonstrated value in uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures.

Conclusion: EvoMorph provides a physiologically-aware method for generating counterfactual explanations in time-series extrinsic regression, supporting uncertainty-aware interpretability for more trustworthy clinical analysis of continuous biomedical signals.

Abstract: Wearable devices enable continuous, population-scale monitoring of physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), creating new opportunities for data-driven clinical assessment. Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these "what-if" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures. Overall, EvoMorph enables the generation of physiologically-aware counterfactuals for continuous biomedical signals and supports uncertainty-aware interpretability, advancing trustworthy model analysis for clinical time-series applications.

*Jay Nandy,Arnab Kumar Mondal,Anuj Rathore,Mahesh Chandran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLGC is a self-supervised graph condensation method that uses pseudo-labels from node embeddings to create small synthetic graphs without needing ground-truth labels, showing strong performance and robustness to label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training GNNs on large graphs is computationally expensive. While graph condensation methods help by generating small synthetic graphs, existing approaches rely on clean supervised labels, limiting their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent.

Method: PLGC constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics without requiring ground-truth labels. It jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments in a self-supervised framework.

Result: PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin across node classification and link prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments, showing that pseudo-labels can preserve latent structural statistics and ensure accurate embedding alignment.

Abstract: Large graph datasets make training graph neural networks (GNNs) computationally costly. Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments.

*Mohsin Hasan,Viktor Ohanesian,Artem Gazizov,Yoshua Bengio,Alán Aspuru-Guzik,Roberto Bondesan,Marta Skreta,Kirill Neklyudov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Discrete Feynman-Kac Correctors is a framework to control generated distributions in discrete diffusion models without extra training, applying Sequential Monte Carlo for annealing, product sampling, and reward integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models are promising for sequence generation, but their standard denoising or demasking processes lack flexible control over the distribution of generated samples, limiting their applicability in tasks requiring specific distributional properties.

Method: The paper proposes a framework using Discrete Feynman-Kac Correctors, which derives Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to control inference-time generated distributions from trained discrete diffusion models, enabling temperature control, product sampling from multiple processes, and integration with external reward functions.

Result: The framework effectively samples from annealed Boltzmann distributions of the Ising model, improves language models for code generation and amortized learning, and generates protein sequences with high reward, all without additional training or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Discrete Feynman-Kac Correctors provides a powerful and training-free method to enhance discrete diffusion models by enabling flexible distribution control, expanding their utility in diverse applications like statistical physics, language modeling, and biological sequence generation.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive approach for generating discrete sequences. Sample generation via gradual denoising or demasking processes allows them to capture hierarchical non-sequential interdependencies in the data. These custom processes, however, do not assume a flexible control over the distribution of generated samples. We propose Discrete Feynman-Kac Correctors, a framework that allows for controlling the generated distribution of discrete masked diffusion models at inference time. We derive Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms that, given a trained discrete diffusion model, control the temperature of the sampled distribution (i.e. perform annealing), sample from the product of marginals of several diffusion processes (e.g. differently conditioned processes), and sample from the product of the marginal with an external reward function, producing likely samples from the target distribution that also have high reward. Notably, our framework does not require any training of additional models or fine-tuning of the original model. We illustrate the utility of our framework in several applications including: efficient sampling from the annealed Boltzmann distribution of the Ising model, improving the performance of language models for code generation and amortized learning, as well as reward-tilted protein sequence generation.

### [101] [CS-GBA: A Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10407)
*Yuanjie Zhao,Junnan Qiu,Yue Ding,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An attack method (CS-GBA) that efficiently poisons offline reinforcement learning datasets to cause backdoors, using gradient guidance and stealthy triggers, achieving high success with minimal budget while preserving clean performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on offline RL are inefficient against safety-constrained algorithms like CQL due to random poisoning and detectable triggers, necessitating a more stealthy and effective approach.

Method: The approach selects critical samples based on high TD errors, uses a trigger that breaks correlations in state features for stealth, and generates worst-case actions via gradient guidance rather than simple label inversion.

Result: Experiments on D4RL benchmarks show the method outperforms baselines, achieving high attack success rates with only 5% poisoning while maintaining agent performance in clean environments.

Conclusion: CS-GBA provides a novel, efficient backdoor attack framework for offline RL that enhances stealth and effectiveness under budget constraints, highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-constrained algorithms.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy optimization from static datasets but is inherently vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attack strategies typically struggle against safety-constrained algorithms (e.g., CQL) due to inefficient random poisoning and the use of easily detectable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) triggers. In this paper, we propose CS-GBA (Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack), a novel framework designed to achieve high stealthiness and destructiveness under a strict budget. Leveraging the theoretical insight that samples with high Temporal Difference (TD) errors are pivotal for value function convergence, we introduce an adaptive Critical Sample Selection strategy that concentrates the attack budget on the most influential transitions. To evade OOD detection, we propose a Correlation-Breaking Trigger mechanism that exploits the physical mutual exclusivity of state features (e.g., 95th percentile boundaries) to remain statistically concealed. Furthermore, we replace the conventional label inversion with a Gradient-Guided Action Generation mechanism, which searches for worst-case actions within the data manifold using the victim Q-network's gradient. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high attack success rates against representative safety-constrained algorithms with a minimal 5% poisoning budget, while maintaining the agent's performance in clean environments.

### [102] [Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Step Lookahead Information Via Adaptive Batching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10418)
*Nadav Merlis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive batching policies (ABPs) for tabular RL with multi-step lookahead to overcome limitations of existing heuristics, with a learning algorithm achieving near-optimal regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing heuristics (fixed batching and model predictive control) for tabular RL with multi-step lookahead have limitations; adaptive batching can better utilize future information while remaining tractable.

Method: Developed adaptive batching policies (ABPs) that process lookahead in state-dependent batches, derived their optimal Bellman equations, and designed an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm for unknown environments.

Result: The proposed algorithm learns optimal ABPs with regret bounds that are order-optimal up to a factor of the lookahead horizon ℓ (usually small).

Conclusion: Adaptive batching policies (ABPs) provide a promising solution to the NP-hard problem of optimal policy design with multi-step lookahead, offering practical algorithms with order-optimal regret guarantees.

Abstract: We study tabular reinforcement learning problems with multiple steps of lookahead information. Before acting, the learner observes $\ell$ steps of future transition and reward realizations: the exact state the agent would reach and the rewards it would collect under any possible course of action. While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments. Our regret bounds are order-optimal up to a potential factor of the lookahead horizon $\ell$, which can usually be considered a small constant.

TL;DR: A Self-Evolving Concierge System using Dynamic Mixture of Experts addresses LLM scalability issues by dynamically hiring specialized sub-agents instead of static swarms, reducing context pollution and resource overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs deployed as autonomous agents face a "Generalization-Specialization Dilemma" - monolithic agents with extensive toolkits suffer from context pollution and attention decay causing hallucinations, while static multi-agent swarms introduce significant latency and resource overhead.

Method: The paper introduces a Self-Evolving Concierge System using Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DMoE). Instead of rewriting codebase like self-improving agents, it dynamically restructures runtime environment by hiring specialized sub-agents based on real-time conversation analysis. Features include: asynchronous Meta-Cognition Engine to detect capability gaps, Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy for resource constraints, and Surgical History Pruning mechanism to mitigate refusal bias.

Result: Experimental results show the architecture maintains high task success rates while minimizing token consumption compared to static agent swarms.

Conclusion: The Self-Evolving Concierge System with Dynamic Mixture of Experts approach effectively addresses LLM scalability bottlenecks by dynamically adapting agent specialization while maintaining stability and reducing resource overhead.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, they face a critical scalability bottleneck known as the "Generalization-Specialization Dilemma." Monolithic agents equipped with extensive toolkits suffer from context pollution and attention decay, leading to hallucinations. Conversely, static multi-agent swarms introduce significant latency and resource overhead. This paper introduces a Self-Evolving Concierge System, a novel architecture utilizing a Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DMoE) approach. Unlike recent self-improving agents that rewrite their own codebase, our system preserves stability by dynamically restructuring its runtime environment: "hiring" specialized sub-agents based on real-time conversation analysis. We introduce an asynchronous "Meta-Cognition Engine" that detects capability gaps, a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy for resource constraints, and a novel "Surgical History Pruning" mechanism to mitigate refusal bias. Experimental results demonstrate that this architecture maintains high task success rates while minimizing token consumption compared to static agent swarms.

*Philip Xu,Isabel Wagner,Eerke Boiten*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A framework called Multi-Agent Cooperative Learning (MACL) helps vision-language models better handle out-of-distribution concepts by preventing cross-modal alignment collapse. It uses multiple agents working together to balance the data and update various parts of the process, boosting performance in few-shot and zero-shot situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models often overfit to training data and fail to process OOD concepts, causing alignment collapse between different data types.

Method: Introduce four agents (image, text, name, coordination) that communicate. This includes feature space learning, a context exchange algorithm for few-shot learning, and balancing through collaboration.

Result: Tested on VISTA-Beyond, MACL improved few-shot and zero-shot performance with 1-5% better precision across visual domains.

Conclusion: MACL effectively prevents alignment collapse in vision-language models by using multi-agent cooperation, which boosts their OOD handling.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Multi-Agent Cooperative Learning (MACL) framework to address cross-modal alignment collapse in vision-language models when handling out-of-distribution (OOD) concepts. Four core agents, including image, text, name, and coordination agents, collaboratively mitigate modality imbalance through structured message passing. The proposed framework enables multi-agent feature space name learning, incorporates a context exchange enhanced few-shot learning algorithm, and adopts an adaptive dynamic balancing mechanism to regulate inter-agent contributions. Experiments on the VISTA-Beyond dataset demonstrate that MACL significantly improves performance in both few-shot and zero-shot settings, achieving 1-5% precision gains across diverse visual domains.

### [105] [When Personas Override Payoffs: Role Identity Bias in Multi-Agent LLM Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10102)
*Viswonathan Manoranjan,Snehalkumar `Neil' S. Gaikwad*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: LLM-based multi-agent systems function either as strategic reasoners or identity-driven actors depending on design choices like role personas and payoff visibility, with personas biasing toward socially preferred outcomes even when suboptimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how design choices (role-based personas and payoff visibility) affect reasoning in LLM-based multi-agent systems for strategic tasks, specifically whether they function as strategic reasoners optimizing payoffs or identity-driven actors prioritizing role alignment.

Method: Systematic experiments across four LLM architectures (Qwen-7B, Qwen-32B, Llama-8B, Mistral-7B) in complex environmental decision-making games with four agents, using Nash equilibrium achievement as diagnostic for strategic reasoning.

Result: Role identity bias fundamentally alters strategic reasoning even when payoff-optimal equilibria exist. Removing personas and providing explicit payoffs enables Qwen models to achieve high Nash equilibrium rates. Personas systematically bias equilibrium selection toward socially preferred outcomes (all achieved equilibria correspond to Green Transition). Models fail to reach equilibrium when Tragedy of the Commons is payoff-optimal. Qwen architectures are highly sensitive to both personas and payoff visibility, while Llama and Mistral exhibit rigid reasoning across conditions.

Conclusion: Representational choices (personas and payoff visibility) are substantive governance decisions that determine whether multi-agent systems act as strategic reasoners or identity-driven actors, with important implications for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems for strategic tasks, yet how design choices such as role-based personas and payoff visibility affect reasoning remains poorly understood. We investigate whether multi-agent systems function as strategic reasoners capable of payoff optimization or as identity-driven actors that prioritize role alignment over explicit incentives. Using Nash equilibrium achievement as a diagnostic for strategic reasoning, we conduct systematic experiments across four LLM architectures (Qwen-7B, Qwen-32B, Llama-8B, Mistral-7B) in complex environmental decision-making games involving four agents. We show that role identity bias fundamentally alters strategic reasoning even when payoff-optimal equilibria exist and complete payoff information is available. Removing personas and providing explicit payoffs enables Qwen models to achieve high Nash equilibrium rates, indicating that both conditions are necessary for strategic reasoning. In contrast, personas systematically bias equilibrium selection toward socially preferred outcomes: with personas present, all of the achieved equilibria correspond to Green Transition, while models entirely fail to reach equilibrium when Tragedy of the Commons is payoff-optimal. The effect of explicit payoffs depends entirely on persona presence, revealing strong interactions between representational design choices. We also observe clear model-dependent patterns. Qwen architectures are highly sensitive to both personas and payoff visibility, whereas Llama and Mistral exhibit rigid reasoning behavior across conditions. These findings demonstrate that representational choices are substantive governance decisions that determine whether multi-agent systems act as strategic reasoners or identity-driven actors, with important implications for real-world deployment.

### [107] [Fairness Driven Multi-Agent Path Finding Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10123)
*Aditi Anand,Dildar Ali,Suman Banerjee*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper addresses the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem for both non-rational and rational agents under fairness considerations, proposing a heuristic for non-rational agents and an incentive-compatible mechanism for rational ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem is computationally expensive and becomes more complex when agents are rational and can misreport their private information (e.g., source, destination, preferences). There is a need to address both variants (with non-rational and rational agents) under the realm of fairness.

Method: For the non-rational variant: a heuristic solution. For the rational variant: designing a mechanism and proving its properties (dominant strategy incentive compatible, individually rational). Various solution methodologies are employed to evaluate effectiveness and efficiency.

Result: For non-rational agents: a heuristic solution is developed. For rational agents: a mechanism is developed and proven to be dominant strategy incentive compatible and individually rational. The effectiveness and efficiency of both solution approaches are demonstrated.

Conclusion: For non-rational agents, a heuristic solution is proposed. For rational agents, a mechanism is developed that is proven to be dominant strategy incentive compatible, individually rational, and efficient. The proposed solution approaches are validated through various solution methodologies.

Abstract: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem aims at finding non-conflicting paths for multiple agents from their respective sources to destinations. This problem arises in multiple real-life situations, including robot motion planning and airspace assignment for unmanned aerial vehicle movement. The problem is computationally expensive, and adding to it, the agents are rational and can misreport their private information. In this paper, we study both variants of the problem under the realm of fairness. For the non-rational agents, we propose a heuristic solution for this problem. Considering the agents are rational, we develop a mechanism and demonstrate that it is a dominant strategy, incentive compatible, and individually rational. We employ various solution methodologies to highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches.

*Zhenyu Zhao,Tiankui Zhang,Xiaoxia Xu,Junjie Li,Yuanwei Liu,Wenjuan Xing*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based multipath routing method for multi-hop UAV networks to reduce congestion and latency by dynamically splitting traffic flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-path routing in multi-hop UAV networks causes local congestion and increased traffic delays, harming performance in dynamic environments.

Method: Develops a novel MADRL algorithm called IPPO-DM, using Independent Proximal Policy Optimization with Dirichlet Modeling to solve a Dec-POMDP for optimizing traffic splitting ratios.

Result: Simulation results show that IPPO-DM outperforms benchmark schemes in delivery latency guarantee and packet loss performance.

Conclusion: The proposed traffic-adaptive multipath routing method effectively improves UAV network performance by dynamically managing traffic to meet latency requirements.

Abstract: Multi-hop uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) networks are promising to extend the terrestrial network coverage. Existing multi-hop UAV networks employ a single routing path by selecting the next-hop forwarding node in a hop-by-hop manner, which leads to local congestion and increases traffic delays. In this paper, a novel traffic-adaptive multipath routing method is proposed for multi-hop UAV networks, which enables each UAV to dynamically split and forward traffic flows across multiple next-hop neighbors, thus meeting latency requirements of diverse traffic flows in dynamic mobile environments. An on-time packet delivery ratio maximization problem is formulated to determine the traffic splitting ratios at each hop. This sequential decision-making problem is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). To solve this Dec-POMDP, a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement leaning (MADRL) algorithm, termed Independent Proximal Policy Optimization with Dirichlet Modeling (IPPO-DM), is developed. Specifically, the IPPO serves as the core optimization framework, where the Dirichlet distribution is leveraged to parameterize a continuous stochastic policy network on the probability simplex, inherently ensuring feasible traffic splitting ratios. Simulation results demonstrate that IPPO-DM outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of both delivery latency guarantee and packet loss performance.

*Xi Shi,Mengxin Zheng,Qian Lou*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: LAMaS introduces a latency-aware orchestration framework for multi-agent systems that enables parallel execution and optimizes critical paths to reduce latency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems suffer from high inference latency due to sequential execution and repeated model invocations, limiting scalability in time-sensitive scenarios.

Method: Proposes Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS) framework with explicit latency supervision, learning-based orchestration, and construction of execution topology graphs to optimize critical paths under parallel execution.

Result: Reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks while maintaining or improving task performance.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution is crucial for designing efficient multi-agent systems, as demonstrated by LAMaS's effectiveness.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) enable complex reasoning by coordinating multiple agents, but often incur high inference latency due to multi-step execution and repeated model invocations, severely limiting their scalability and usability in time-sensitive scenarios. Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance. These results highlight the importance of explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution when designing efficient multi-agent systems.

### [110] [Procedural Fairness in Multi-Agent Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10600)
*Joshua Caiata,Carter Blair,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Introduces procedural fairness in multi-agent bandits, emphasizing equal decision-making power alongside outcomes, showing minimal trade-offs with traditional fairness objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper argues that existing fairness approaches in multi-agent multi-armed bandits (MA-MAB) focus too much on outcomes (e.g., welfare maximization, inequality reduction, utility balancing) and neglect the importance of process and decision-making voice, which is supported by evidence from psychology, economics, and Rawlsian theory.

Method: The paper introduces procedural fairness as a new fairness objective that provides equal decision-making power for all agents, lies in the core, and ensures proportionality in outcomes. The approach involves theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation comparing procedural fairness with outcome-based fairness objectives.

Result: Empirical results show that outcome-based fairness notions sacrifice equal voice and representation, while procedurally fair policies cause minimal sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives like equality and utilitarianism. The paper proves that different fairness notions prioritize fundamentally different and incompatible values.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that fairness requires explicit normative choices and that procedural legitimacy deserves greater focus as a fairness objective in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In the context of multi-agent multi-armed bandits (MA-MAB), fairness is often reduced to outcomes: maximizing welfare, reducing inequality, or balancing utilities. However, evidence in psychology, economics, and Rawlsian theory suggests that fairness is also about process and who gets a say in the decisions being made. We introduce a new fairness objective, procedural fairness, which provides equal decision-making power for all agents, lies in the core, and provides for proportionality in outcomes. Empirical results confirm that fairness notions based on optimizing for outcomes sacrifice equal voice and representation, while the sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives (like equality and utilitarianism) is minimal under procedurally fair policies. We further prove that different fairness notions prioritize fundamentally different and incompatible values, highlighting that fairness requires explicit normative choices. This paper argues that procedural legitimacy deserves greater focus as a fairness objective, and provides a framework for putting procedural fairness into practice.
