Conclusion: The Perception Graph offers a robust framework for analyzing and detecting cognitive attacks on AR systems by quantifying perception manipulation effects.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) systems are increasingly deployed in tactical
environments, but their reliance on seamless human-computer interaction makes
them vulnerable to cognitive attacks that manipulate a user's perception and
severely compromise user decision-making. To address this challenge, we
introduce the Perception Graph, a novel model designed to reason about human
perception within these systems. Our model operates by first mimicking the
human process of interpreting key information from an MR environment and then
representing the outcomes using a semantically meaningful structure. We
demonstrate how the model can compute a quantitative score that reflects the
level of perception distortion, providing a robust and measurable method for
detecting and analyzing the effects of such cognitive attacks.

### [7] [Benchmarking Large Language Models for Personalized Guidance in AI-Enhanced Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05346)
*Bo Yuan,Jiazi Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Empirical comparison of GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and GLM-4.5 LLMs in tutoring tasks shows GPT-4o produces superior feedback for personalized learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs in authentic learning scenarios as intelligent teaching assistants, addressing the lack of head-to-head comparisons in realistic educational settings.

Method: Used a dataset of student answers with correctness labels, required LLMs to analyze quizzes, infer mastery profiles, and generate guidance. Employed Gemini as virtual judge for pairwise comparisons across accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness dimensions using Bradley-Terry model.

Result: GPT-4o was generally preferred, producing more informative and better structured feedback than DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5, which showed intermittent strengths but lower consistency.

Conclusion: LLMs are feasible as advanced teaching assistants for individualized support, with GPT-4o demonstrating superior performance, providing methodological guidance for future LLM-driven personalized learning research.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent
assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations
within authentic learning scenarios remain limited. This study conducts an
empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task that
simulates a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset comprising a student's
answers to ten questions of mixed formats with correctness labels, each LLM is
required to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components,
(ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance
for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, we employ Gemini
as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons along various dimensions:
accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the
Bradley-Terry model indicate that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing
feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts,
while DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower
consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as
advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide
methodological guidance for future empirical research on LLM-driven
personalized learning.

### [9] [Characterizing Fitness Landscape Structures in Prompt Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05375)
*Arend Hintze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of prompt engineering optimization landscapes reveals fundamentally different topologies between systematic and diversified prompt generation, with varying ruggedness across different error types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt engineering approaches treat optimization as a black-box problem without understanding the underlying landscape structure, limiting effective algorithm design and performance.

Method: Used autocorrelation analysis across semantic embedding spaces on error detection tasks with two prompt generation strategies: systematic enumeration (1,024 prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts).

Result: Systematic generation shows smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes. Task-specific analysis across 10 error categories reveals varying ruggedness.

Conclusion: The study provides empirical foundation for understanding optimization complexity in prompt engineering landscapes, revealing fundamentally different topologies that impact search algorithm effectiveness.

Abstract: While prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial technique for optimizing
large language model performance, the underlying optimization landscape remains
poorly understood. Current approaches treat prompt optimization as a black-box
problem, applying sophisticated search algorithms without characterizing the
landscape topology they navigate. We present a systematic analysis of fitness
landscape structures in prompt engineering using autocorrelation analysis
across semantic embedding spaces. Through experiments on error detection tasks
with two distinct prompt generation strategies -- systematic enumeration (1,024
prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts) -- we reveal
fundamentally different landscape topologies. Systematic prompt generation
yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits
non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic
distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes.
Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories reveals varying
degrees of ruggedness across different error types. Our findings provide an
empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt
engineering landscapes.

### [10] [Murphys Laws of AI Alignment: Why the Gap Always Wins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05381)
*Madhava Gaikwad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Alignment Gap concept to explain recurring failures in AI alignment methods like RLHF and DPO, showing how optimization pressure amplifies divergence from true human intent through a KL-tilting framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods (RLHF, DPO, Constitutional AI, RLAIF) exhibit recurring failure patterns including reward hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization, indicating systematic issues in feedback-based alignment approaches.

Method: Uses KL-tilting formalism to illustrate optimization pressure effects, organizes failures into a catalogue of "Murphy's Laws of AI Alignment," proposes the Alignment Trilemma framework, and conducts small-scale empirical studies for support.

Result: Identifies structural patterns in alignment failures and demonstrates how optimization tends to amplify divergence between proxy rewards and true human intent through theoretical analysis and empirical illustrations.

Conclusion: Proposes the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure, Shift) as practical design levers and reframes alignment debates around structural limits and trade-offs rather than presenting an impossibility theorem.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly aligned to human preferences through
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methods such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, and RLAIF. While
effective, these methods exhibit recurring failure patterns i.e., reward
hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization. We introduce the
concept of the Alignment Gap, a unifying lens for understanding recurring
failures in feedback-based alignment. Using a KL-tilting formalism, we
illustrate why optimization pressure tends to amplify divergence between proxy
rewards and true human intent. We organize these failures into a catalogue of
Murphys Laws of AI Alignment, and propose the Alignment Trilemma as a way to
frame trade-offs among optimization strength, value capture, and
generalization. Small-scale empirical studies serve as illustrative support.
Finally, we propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure,
Shift) as practical design levers. Our contribution is not a definitive
impossibility theorem but a perspective that reframes alignment debates around
structural limits and trade-offs, offering clearer guidance for future design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional street-design visualization is labor-intensive, hindering public engagement and collaborative decision-making in active transportation planning.

Method: Multi-agent system with lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation, and automated evaluation to edit bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery.

Result: System adapts to diverse urban scenarios, varying road geometries, and environmental conditions, producing visually coherent and instruction-compliant designs.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation infrastructure planning and facility design, overcoming limitations of traditional generative approaches.

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation
infrastructure planning and facility design.

### [12] [TreeGPT: A Novel Hybrid Architecture for Abstract Syntax Tree Processing with Global Parent-Child Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05550)
*Zixi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TreeGPT is a novel neural architecture combining transformer attention with global parent-child aggregation for processing Abstract Syntax Trees in program synthesis, achieving 96% accuracy on ARC Prize 2025 with only 1.5M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches rely on sequential processing or graph neural networks, but lack effective modeling of hierarchical tree structures in program synthesis tasks. The need for a hybrid approach that captures both local dependencies and global tree hierarchy.

Method: Hybrid design using self-attention for local dependencies and specialized Tree Feed-Forward Network with Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism. Includes gated aggregation, residual connections, and bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down dependencies.

Result: Achieves 96% accuracy on ARC Prize 2025 dataset, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3%), Grok-4 (15.9%), and SOAR (52%) with only 1.5M parameters. Ablation study shows edge projection is the most critical component.

Conclusion: TreeGPT demonstrates superior performance in neural program synthesis by effectively combining transformer mechanisms with hierarchical tree structure modeling, offering an efficient and powerful solution for AST processing tasks.

Abstract: We introduce TreeGPT, a novel neural architecture that combines
transformer-based attention mechanisms with global parent-child aggregation for
processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in neural program synthesis tasks.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on sequential processing or
graph neural networks, TreeGPT employs a hybrid design that leverages both
self-attention for capturing local dependencies and a specialized Tree
Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) for modeling hierarchical tree structures
through iterative message passing.
  The core innovation lies in our Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism,
formalized as: $$h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma \Big( h_i^{(0)} + W_{pc} \sum_{(p,c) \in
E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b \Big)$$ where $h_i^{(t)}$ represents the
hidden state of node $i$ at iteration $t$, $E_i$ denotes all parent-child edges
involving node $i$, and $f(h_p, h_c)$ is an edge aggregation function. This
formulation enables each node to progressively aggregate information from the
entire tree structure through $T$ iterations.
  Our architecture integrates optional enhancements including gated aggregation
with learnable edge weights, residual connections for gradient stability, and
bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down
dependencies. We evaluate TreeGPT on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, a challenging
visual reasoning benchmark requiring abstract pattern recognition and rule
inference. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeGPT achieves 96\%
accuracy, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3\%),
large-scale models like Grok-4 (15.9\%), and specialized program synthesis
methods like SOAR (52\%) while using only 1.5M parameters. Our comprehensive
ablation study reveals that edge projection is the most critical component,
with the combination of edge projection and gating achieving optimal
performance.

### [13] [OccVLA: Vision-Language-Action Model with Implicit 3D Occupancy Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05578)
*Ruixun Liu,Lingyu Kong,Derun Li,Hang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OccVLA integrates 3D occupancy representations into multimodal reasoning for autonomous driving, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmark without extra computational overhead during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack robust 3D spatial understanding critical for autonomous driving due to challenges in constructing accessible 3D representations and loss of fine-grained spatial details in VLMs without large-scale 3D pretraining.

Method: Proposes OccVLA framework that treats dense 3D occupancy as both predictive output and supervisory signal, enabling learning of fine-grained spatial structures directly from 2D visual inputs. Occupancy predictions serve as implicit reasoning processes that can be skipped during inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks.

Conclusion: OccVLA offers a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for autonomous driving that learns 3D spatial understanding without expensive manual annotations or extra computational overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language
reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is
critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges:
(1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations
without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial
details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language
pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework
that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal
reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs,
OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory
signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly
from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit
reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance
degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and
demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks,
offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for
autonomous driving.

### [14] [MSRFormer: Road Network Representation Learning using Multi-scale Feature Fusion of Heterogeneous Spatial Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05685)
*Jian Yang,Jiahui Wu,Li Fang,Hongchao Fan,Bianying Zhang,Huijie Zhao,Guangyi Yang,Rui Xin,Xiong You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSRFormer is a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions using spatial flow convolution and graph transformers to address flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies in urban road networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban road networks have heterogeneous and hierarchical nature, making accurate representation learning challenging. Traditional graph neural networks struggle due to homogeneity assumptions and single-scale focus.

Method: Uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from trajectory data, identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions, employs graph transformer for multi-scale dependencies, and fuses features with residual connections for contrastive learning.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods on two real-world datasets, with up to 16% improvement in complex road network structures. Traffic-related tasks benefit more from trajectory data incorporation.

Conclusion: Provides a practical framework for task-agnostic road network representation models and reveals distinct association patterns between scale effects and flow heterogeneity in spatial interactions.

Abstract: Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep
learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road
networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate
representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from
neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus
on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents
MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that
integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow
heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution
to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies
scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of
road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,
MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple
scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,
which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road
network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that
MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The
performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more
from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in
complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the
most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework
for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights
distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow
heterogeneity of spatial interactions.

TL;DR: CogEdit benchmark evaluates MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge editing across three levels: counterfactual awareness, boundary constraints, and noise robustness. MIND framework outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on cognitive-level modifications but lack deeper meta-cognitive processes for knowledge editing in multimodal LLMs.

Method: Proposed MIND framework with meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, game-theoretic interactions for knowledge activation monitoring, and label refinement for noise-robust updates.

Result: MIND significantly outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The CogEdit benchmark and MIND framework successfully address the gap in meta-cognitive knowledge editing evaluation and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry provides promising representation space for LLMs to handle hierarchical structures, with ongoing research directions and applications across various domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and
demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural
language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding,
text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world
data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein
networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and
linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively
learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from
these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area.
Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures,
hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity
as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across
domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we
provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in
LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance
semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the
paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs
(HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log
maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4)
hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications
and outline future research directions. A repository of key papers, models,
datasets, and code implementations is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems using LLMs lack performance quantification and credibility assessment mechanisms, limiting their effectiveness in complex tasks.

Method: DRF constructs interactive rating networks, designs reputation scoring for honesty/capability measurement, and uses UCB-based strategy for efficient agent selection.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in task completion quality and collaboration efficiency for logical reasoning and code-generation tasks.

Conclusion: DRF provides an effective approach for multi-agent systems to handle large-scale tasks by addressing performance quantification and credibility assessment challenges.

Abstract: With the evolution of generative AI, multi - agent systems leveraging large -
language models(LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for complex tasks.
However, these systems face challenges in quantifying agent performance and
lack mechanisms to assess agent credibility. To address these issues, we
introduce DRF, a dynamic reputation filtering framework. DRF constructs an
interactive rating network to quantify agent performance, designs a reputation
scoring mechanism to measure agent honesty and capability, and integrates an
Upper Confidence Bound - based strategy to enhance agent selection efficiency.
Experiments show that DRF significantly improves task completion quality and
collaboration efficiency in logical reasoning and code - generation tasks,
offering a new approach for multi - agent systems to handle large - scale
tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AFE-DFL framework combines automated feature engineering with decision-focused learning to optimize battery energy storage operations, reducing costs by 22.9-56.5% compared to traditional methods on real-world UK data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Predict-Then-Optimize approaches suffer from error cascading in energy management, while Decision-Focused Learning methods lack real-world validation and struggle with data scarcity and variability in BESS operations.

Method: Proposed AFE-DFL framework that integrates automated feature engineering to extract richer representations from small datasets, combining electricity price/demand forecasting with BESS optimization to minimize operational costs.

Result: DFL methods yielded lower operating costs than PTO approaches, and adding AFE improved DFL performance by 22.9-56.5% compared to models without automated feature engineering.

Conclusion: The framework provides empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in real-world settings, demonstrating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL performance and reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimization with broader energy management implications.

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty in energy management is complicated by
unknown parameters hindering optimal strategies, particularly in Battery Energy
Storage System (BESS) operations. Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat
forecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors
to cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors
rather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning
(DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and
optimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily
on synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their
practical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional
challenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection
constraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work
leverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations
and improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework
suitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while
optimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on
a novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods
against PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL
yields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the
performance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without
AFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in
real-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and
reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic
benefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar
challenges.

TL;DR: NoteAid-Chatbot is a conversational AI that helps patients understand medical information using a multi-agent LLM and RL framework without human-labeled data, achieving human-level performance in patient education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patients need knowledge to actively participate in their care, requiring effective educational tools that promote understanding of medical information.

Method: Built on LLaMA 3.2 3B model with two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning on synthetically generated medical conversations, followed by RL with rewards based on patient understanding assessments in simulated discharge scenarios.

Result: Exhibits emergent behaviors like clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue without explicit supervision. Surpasses non-expert humans in Turing tests and demonstrates PPO-based RL can train lightweight chatbots for complex conversational domains.

Conclusion: The framework shows feasibility of low-cost, PPO-based RL for realistic conversational applications, broadening RL-based alignment methods beyond healthcare.

Abstract: Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in
their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes
patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built
on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL)
setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight
LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on
conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation
strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding
assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which
includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates
that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient
education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it
received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that
even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can
successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn
interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced
communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot
surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the
framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying
low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains,
broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.

### [20] [MapAgent: A Hierarchical Agent for Geospatial Reasoning with Dynamic Map Tool Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05933)
*Md Hasebul Hasan,Mahir Labib Dihan,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MapAgent is a hierarchical multi-agent framework for geospatial reasoning that outperforms existing approaches by decoupling planning from execution and using specialized modules for map-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agent frameworks are inadequate for geospatial tasks requiring spatial reasoning, multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction, as they treat tools uniformly and overwhelm LLMs with similar geospatial APIs.

Method: Hierarchical multi-agent framework with high-level planner that decomposes queries into subgoals, specialized modules for different tasks, and dedicated map-tool agent that orchestrates geospatial APIs in parallel while simpler modules operate without agent overhead.

Result: Substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented and agentic baselines on four diverse geospatial benchmarks (MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and MapQA).

Conclusion: MapAgent's hierarchical design reduces cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise coordination across similar APIs for effective geospatial reasoning.

Abstract: Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most
existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web
automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,
multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,
we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with
customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial
reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools
uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different
geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level
planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to
specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then
design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs
adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the
query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)
operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces
cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise
coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse
geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and
MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented
and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at

*Haoyang He,Zihua Rong,Kun Ji,Chenyang Li,Qing Huang,Chong Xia,Lan Yang,Honggang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRER is a new RL reward framework that improves reasoning in LLMs by rewarding beneficial reasoning steps and stabilizing training with dynamic length control, achieving strong performance on logical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs only assess answer correctness without evaluating reasoning quality, providing no signal about whether Chain-of-Thought actually improves answers or reveals genuine reasoning capacity.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) with two components: (1) Reasoning Quality Reward that assigns fine-grained credit to reasoning chains that raise correct answer likelihood, (2) Dynamic Length Advantage that decays advantage for responses deviating from optimal length. Also releases Logictree dataset for training and evaluation.

Result: 7B model achieves GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with only 400 training steps, 30% increase in CoT answer confidence, and demonstrates generalization across diverse logical reasoning datasets and AIME24 mathematical benchmark.

Conclusion: DRER effectively shapes Chain-of-Thought behavior and provides a practical path to enhance formal reasoning skills in large language models through improved RL reward mechanisms.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for
strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the
rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming
benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to
whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.
Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical
depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We
propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward
framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning
Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that
demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising
the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage
decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a
validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous
assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive
reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a
comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B
model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing
steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The
model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning
datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how
RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing
formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are
available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.

TL;DR: REER introduces a reverse-engineering approach to discover latent reasoning processes from solutions, creating DeepWriting-20K dataset and achieving competitive performance with proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning methods (RL and instruction distillation) struggle with open-ended creative generation due to unclear reward signals, expensive training, and teacher model limitations.

Method: REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER) works backwards from known-good solutions to computationally discover step-by-step deep reasoning processes, using a scalable gradient-free approach.

Result: Created DeepWriting-20K dataset with 20K reasoning trajectories. DeepWriter-8B model trained on this data outperforms open-source baselines and competes with GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Conclusion: REER provides a novel paradigm for instilling deep reasoning in open-ended tasks, overcoming limitations of traditional forward-building approaches through reverse engineering from solutions.

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

TL;DR: EDIT is a test-time scaling method that helps large reasoning models find the shortest correct reasoning paths by balancing conciseness and correctness, addressing the overthinking problem in LRMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) suffer from overthinking - they overcomplicate simple problems with excessive strategy switching and long reasoning traces, which hinders interpretability and efficiency.

Method: Proposes EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference Trimming), a test-time scaling method that uses constraint-guided generation while jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints to identify optimal reasoning paths.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets show EDIT substantially enhances reasoning efficiency, producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user experience.

Conclusion: EDIT effectively mitigates the overthinking problem in LRMs by enabling them to find the shortest correct reasoning paths, achieving better balance between conciseness and correctness.

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user
experience.

*Manvi Jha,Jiaxin Wan,Deming Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proof2Silicon is an end-to-end framework that uses reinforcement learning to optimize prompts for LLMs, enabling generation of formally verifiable Dafny code from natural language specs, which is then translated to C and synthesized into hardware RTL with up to 72% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate code that fails formal verification, which is critical for hardware and safety-critical applications. There's a need for automated generation of correctness-by-construction hardware from natural language specifications.

Method: Uses PREFACE's verifier-driven RL agent for prompt optimization to ensure Dafny code correctness, automatically translates verified Dafny to C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog, then employs Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations.

Result: PREFACE improved Dafny verification success rates by up to 21% across diverse LLMs. Proof2Silicon achieved 72% end-to-end hardware synthesis success rate on a 100-task benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, scalable automated pipeline for LLM-driven formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural language specification to silicon realization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal
verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical
domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed
PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that
iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically
steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly
fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis
framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the
generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural
language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's
verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring
Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs
into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)
employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a
challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization
consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by
up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis
success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis
flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for
LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language
specification and silicon realization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized AI assistants struggle with complex personal data and causal knowledge, leading to generic advice lacking explanatory power.

Method: Uses personal causal graph of user's life events/habits, performs goal-directed causal traversals with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, retrieves adaptable plan schemas, and orchestrates with LLM for transparent explanations.

Result: CSM-based agents provide more context-aware, user-aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents, as measured by new metrics like Personalization Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a novel approach to memory-augmented causal reasoning in personalized agents, advancing transparent and trustworthy AI lifestyle assistants.

Abstract: Personalized AI assistants often struggle to incorporate complex personal
data and causal knowledge, leading to generic advice that lacks explanatory
power. We propose REMI, a Causal Schema Memory architecture for a multimodal
lifestyle agent that integrates a personal causal knowledge graph, a causal
reasoning engine, and a schema based planning module. The idea is to deliver
explainable, personalized recommendations in domains like fashion, personal
wellness, and lifestyle planning. Our architecture uses a personal causal graph
of the user's life events and habits, performs goal directed causal traversals
enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves
adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. A Large Language
Model orchestrates these components, producing answers with transparent causal
explanations. We outline the CSM system design and introduce new evaluation
metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization
Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its
performance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context
aware, user aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents. This work
demonstrates a novel approach to memory augmented, causal reasoning in
personalized agents, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy

TL;DR: TableMind is an LLM-driven table reasoning agent that autonomously uses tools, writes/executes code in sandbox, and employs planning/self-reflection for complex numerical table reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based LLMs struggle with complex numerical computations in table reasoning, while tool-integrated systems lack autonomous adaptability and rely on rigid patterns.

Method: Two-stage fine-tuning: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories followed by reinforcement fine-tuning with Rank-Aware Policy Optimization (RAPO) to optimize multi-objective strategies.

Result: TableMind achieves superior performance on mainstream benchmarks with substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy and computational precision compared to competitive baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed autonomous tool-integrated reasoning approach with two-stage fine-tuning and RAPO effectively addresses complex numerical table reasoning challenges, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as
finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models
(LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often
struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations
inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves
computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems
frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true
autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven
table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool
invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox
environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)
exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt
strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool
usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize
multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy
Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality
trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of
low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and
more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks
demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to
competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy
and computational precision.

Motivation: Enable autonomous single-agent systems for deep research that can dynamically determine actions without manual directives, unlike static multi-agent workflows.

Method: Continual reinforcement learning with entirely synthetic data applied to reasoning-optimized open-source LLMs, featuring minimal web crawling and Python tool integration.

Result: Best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam benchmark.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning with synthetic data effectively enhances agentic skills while preserving reasoning capabilities in autonomous single-agent models for deep research applications.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more
insights into our methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM reasoning methods rely on unguided stochastic paths, leading to unstable reasoning, lack of error correction, and limited learning from experience.

Method: Extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and reflective signals from failures. During inference, follow guidelines step-by-step with refinement applied after each step to correct errors.

Result: Consistently outperforms strong baselines on BBH, GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, and HumanEval benchmarks across diverse reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability and generalization, with guidelines transferring well across domains and supporting cross-model collaboration effectively.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose reasoning, showing
strong performance across diverse tasks. However, existing methods often rely
on implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided
reasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning
paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To
address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit
exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we
extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and
reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these
guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct
errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four
additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.
Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability
and generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly
support cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised
fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

*Lei Shu,Dong Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show promise for energy retrofit decision making, achieving up to 54.5% top 1 match and 92.8% within top 5 recommendations without fine-tuning, but need improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional energy retrofit approaches suffer from limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in diverse residential contexts. Generative AI and LLMs can process contextual information to produce readable recommendations.

Method: Evaluated 7 LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Llama, Claude) on residential retrofit decisions across 400 homes in 49 US states. Assessed performance on accuracy, consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning under technical (CO2 reduction) and sociotechnical (payback period) objectives.

Result: LLMs generate effective recommendations with stronger performance for technical objectives. Models show low agreement, with higher performers diverging from others. Sensitive to location and building geometry but less to technology and occupant behavior. Most show simplified engineering-style reasoning lacking deeper context.

Conclusion: LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision making but require improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling for reliable practice.

Abstract: Conventional approaches to building energy retrofit decision making suffer
from limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in
diverse residential contexts. With the growth of Smart and Connected
Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help
by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable
recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok,
Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives:
maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period
(sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy,
consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49
US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up
to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning.
Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical
decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement
across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others.
LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to
technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering
style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual
awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision
making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are
needed for reliable practice.

TL;DR: LLMs can simulate virtual survey respondents through Partial Attribute Simulation (predicting missing attributes) and Full Attribute Simulation (generating complete synthetic datasets), with performance evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark across 11 real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional survey methods are costly, time-consuming, and limited in scale, creating a need for scalable and cost-effective alternatives for sociological research and policy evaluation.

Method: Introduced PAS (predicting missing attributes from partial profiles) and FAS (generating complete synthetic datasets under zero-context and context-enhanced conditions), evaluated on LLM-S^3 benchmark with 11 datasets across 4 sociological domains using GPT-3.5/4 Turbo and LLaMA models.

Result: LLMs show consistent prediction performance trends, with identified failure modes and demonstrated impact of context and prompt design on simulation fidelity.

Conclusion: This work establishes a rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey simulations, providing scalable and cost-effective tools for sociological research and policy evaluation.

Abstract: Questionnaire-based surveys are foundational to social science research and
public policymaking, yet traditional survey methods remain costly,
time-consuming, and often limited in scale. This paper explores a new paradigm:
simulating virtual survey respondents using Large Language Models (LLMs). We
introduce two novel simulation settings, namely Partial Attribute Simulation
(PAS) and Full Attribute Simulation (FAS), to systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate accurate and demographically coherent responses. In
PAS, the model predicts missing attributes based on partial respondent
profiles, whereas FAS involves generating complete synthetic datasets under
both zero-context and context-enhanced conditions. We curate a comprehensive
benchmark suite, LLM-S^3 (Large Language Model-based Sociodemographic Survey
Simulation), that spans 11 real-world public datasets across four sociological
domains. Our evaluation of multiple mainstream LLMs (GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA
3.0/3.1-8B) reveals consistent trends in prediction performance, highlights
failure modes, and demonstrates how context and prompt design impact simulation
fidelity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey
simulations, offering scalable and cost-effective tools for sociological
research and policy evaluation. Our code and dataset are available at:

TL;DR: A multi-turn evaluation framework for measuring LLM seller agents' bargaining ability in e-commerce, featuring a large-scale benchmark and automated intent extraction pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can serve as seller agents in online marketplaces, but need to accurately track cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations for effective bargaining.

Method: Developed a turn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind with annotated buyer intents, plus an automated pipeline to extract reliable intent from dialogue data.

Result: Created a large-scale e-commerce bargaining benchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks for comprehensive testing.

Conclusion: The framework enables more nuanced evaluation of seller agents' bargaining effectiveness beyond just outcome metrics, focusing on intent tracking capabilities.

Abstract: In online second-hand marketplaces, multi-turn bargaining is a crucial part
of seller-buyer interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as seller
agents, negotiating with buyers on behalf of sellers under given business
constraints. A critical ability for such agents is to track and accurately
interpret cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations, which directly
impacts bargaining effectiveness. We introduce a multi-turn evaluation
framework for measuring the bargaining ability of seller agents in e-commerce
dialogues. The framework tests whether an agent can extract and track buyer
intents. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale e-commerce bargaining
benchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks; (2) a
turn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind (ToM) with annotated
buyer intents, moving beyond outcome-only metrics; and (3) an automated
pipeline that extracts reliable intent from massive dialogue data.

Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must
balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a
novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in
3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level

testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement
decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level
mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint
system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired
with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament
data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays
generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tree of Agents (TOA) is a multi-agent framework that segments long inputs into chunks processed by independent agents, enabling collaborative reasoning through tree-structured information exchange to address lost-in-the-middle issues in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-context tasks due to lost-in-the-middle issues where middle information is underutilized, and existing methods either risk discarding key information or cause attention dispersion.

Method: Multi-agent framework that segments input into chunks, processes them independently with local cognition generation, then dynamically exchanges information through tree-structured paths with prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning for efficiency.

Result: TOA with LLaMA3.1-8B significantly outperforms baselines and achieves comparable performance to much larger commercial models like Gemini1.5-pro on various long-context tasks with comparable API overhead.

Conclusion: TOA effectively mitigates position bias and reduces hallucinations in long-context processing through multi-agent collaborative reasoning, offering efficient performance improvements without excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling
long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where
information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized.
Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key
information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention
dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a
multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed
by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents
dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along
tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders
for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and
reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate
prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant
performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that
TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple
baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger
commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code

TL;DR: HyFedRAG is a federated RAG framework for hybrid healthcare data that enables privacy-preserving retrieval across SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes using edge-cloud collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized RAG struggles with heterogeneous healthcare data due to privacy constraints and format diversity. Clinicians need to retrieve rare disease cases without compromising patient privacy across distributed data sources.

Method: Edge-cloud collaborative framework using Flower, with edge-side LLMs converting diverse data into standardized privacy-preserving representations, lightweight local retrievers with anonymization tools, and a three-tier caching strategy for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on PMC-Patients dataset in retrieval quality, generation consistency, and system efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides scalable, privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data, unlocking LLM potential in sensitive healthcare environments.

Abstract: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive
data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans
SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties
retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of
traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge
devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient
Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an
edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across
diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:
(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which
supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and
unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into
standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs
integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate
lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three
anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,
de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize
response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier
caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,
and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate
that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,
generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable
and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data,
unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel instruction data selection method that identifies instruction depth and semantic coverage as key factors for model alignment performance, achieving accelerated scaling compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving model alignment performance and efficiency for large language models applied to downstream tasks, as current methods fail to scale effectively with expanding instruction pools.

Method: Investigates key factors influencing instruction dataset distribution and model performance, then designs an instruction selection algorithm to maximize instruction depth and semantic coverage simultaneously.

Result: The method explains over 70% of model loss on development set and demonstrates sustainable performance improvement at a faster pace than state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Conclusion: Instruction depth and semantic coverage are crucial factors for aligned model performance, and the proposed selection method enables accelerated scaling in model alignment.

Abstract: With the growing demand for applying large language models to downstream
tasks, improving model alignment performance and efficiency has become crucial.
Such a process involves selecting informative instructions from a candidate
pool. However, due to the complexity of instruction set distributions, the key
factors driving the performance of aligned models remain unclear. As a result,
current instruction set refinement methods fail to improve performance as the
instruction pool expands continuously. To address this issue, we first
investigate the key factors that influence the relationship between instruction
dataset distribution and aligned model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a novel instruction data selection method. We identify that the depth
of instructions and the coverage of the semantic space are the crucial factors
determining downstream performance, which could explain over 70\% of the model
loss on the development set. We then design an instruction selection algorithm
to simultaneously maximize the depth and semantic coverage of the selected
instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to
state-of-the-art baseline methods, it can sustainably improve model performance
at a faster pace and thus achieve \emph{``Accelerated Scaling''}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of systematic benchmarking frameworks for hybrid GUI agents that combine flexible GUI operations with efficient shortcuts (APIs, deep links, RPA scripts) despite their emerging importance.

Method: Created MAS-Bench with 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base of 88 predefined shortcuts, and 7 evaluation metrics to assess agents' ability to autonomously generate and use shortcuts.

Result: Hybrid agents achieved significantly higher success rates and efficiency compared to GUI-only counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the benchmark for evaluating shortcut generation capabilities.

Conclusion: MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap and provides a foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and robust intelligent agents that combine GUI operations with shortcut capabilities.

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency of GUI agents on various platforms like smartphones
and computers, a hybrid paradigm that combines flexible GUI operations with
efficient shortcuts (e.g., API, deep links) is emerging as a promising
direction. However, a framework for systematically benchmarking these hybrid
agents is still underexplored. To take the first step in bridging this gap, we
introduce MAS-Bench, a benchmark that pioneers the evaluation of GUI-shortcut
hybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using
predefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously
generate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It
features 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base
of 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation
metrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can
be significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments
show that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and
efficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation
capabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a
foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and
robust intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods struggle with real-time adaptation to dynamic supply chain environments with conflicting objectives like cost, service level, and sustainability.

Method: Uses MOEAs to search policy neural network parameter space, generating Pareto front of policies that can be dynamically switched. Incorporates CVaR for risk-sensitive decision-making.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness through case studies, showing ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperform state-of-the-art methods in inventory management.

Conclusion: Provides more robust framework for managing uncertainty, improving decision-making efficiency and adaptability in real-time supply chain optimization.

Abstract: In supply chain management, decision-making often involves balancing multiple
conflicting objectives, such as cost reduction, service level improvement, and
environmental sustainability. Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,
such as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in
real-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an
approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to address these challenges for dynamic
multi-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to
search the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front
of policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of
policies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system
objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.
We also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate
risk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,
showcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study. The proposed
strategy not only improves decision-making efficiency but also offers a more
robust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply
chains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integration of LLMs into automated theorem proving is constrained by challenges in scaling both training-time reinforcement learning and inference-time compute, requiring solutions to overcome performance plateaus and enable efficient complex reasoning.

Method: Two innovations: 1) Multi-turn off-policy RL framework with AlphaZero-inspired expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and periodic retraining; 2) Planner-enhanced multi-agent search architecture using general reasoning model as high-level planner to decompose theorems into subgoals with shared proof cache.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: 95.08% on MiniF2F and 41.4% on ProofNet test sets, demonstrating effective scaling of both training and inference capabilities.

Conclusion: The dual approach to scaling yields superior performance in formal mathematics, and the RL and inference techniques have broader applicability to domains requiring long-horizon multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem
proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by
challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and
inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system
designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary
innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for
continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This
framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage
expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and
periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail
long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced
multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference
time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level
planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler
subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,
enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by
leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to
scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics
benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F
and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal
mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of
broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon
multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

Motivation: Addressing issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models by mimicking human cognitive processes.

Method: Plug-and-play three-module pipeline (Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, Strategy Selector) that constructs "understand-plan-select" cognitive process through intent sketch strategies, requiring no parameter fine-tuning and using in-context engineering for cross-model transfer.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline combinations with gains up to 9.51 percentage points on IntentBench, WorldSense, and Daily-Omni benchmarks.

Conclusion: The intent sketch reasoning component demonstrates practical value and portability in zero-shot scenarios, effectively suppressing unintended shortcut reasoning and improving information utilization efficiency.

Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding
in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper
proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like
cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a
plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and
Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select"
cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to
guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves
cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.
Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional
entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing
unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and
Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with
their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields
consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline
combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,
demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch"
reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

TL;DR: This survey paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of reinforcement learning foundations for deep research systems, covering data synthesis, RL methods, training systems, and evaluation benchmarks for agentic AI that performs complex multi-step tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep research systems rely on supervised fine-tuning and preference alignment methods that suffer from imitation bias, exposure bias, and weak credit assignment for long-horizon tasks. RL offers better alignment with tool-interaction research by enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment.

Method: The survey systematizes work along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation, (ii) RL methods covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward design, and multi-objective optimization, and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. It also covers architecture, coordination, and evaluation benchmarks.

Result: The paper distills recurring patterns, identifies infrastructure bottlenecks, and provides practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents using reinforcement learning methods.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning provides a more effective foundation for deep research systems compared to SFT and DPO approaches, enabling better exploration, credit assignment, and reduced dependence on human priors and biases for complex multi-step research tasks.

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

TL;DR: VehicleWorld introduces a comprehensive automotive environment with 30 modules and 250 APIs, proposing State-based Function Call (SFC) which outperforms traditional function calling by maintaining explicit system state awareness for vehicle cockpit control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent vehicle cockpits require coordination across complex subsystems, but traditional Function Calling approaches operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls that lead to inefficiency and limited error recovery.

Method: Created VehicleWorld environment with 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties. Proposed State-based Function Call (SFC) that maintains explicit system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve target conditions.

Result: SFC significantly outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy and reduced latency. Direct state prediction was found to outperform function calling for environmental control.

Conclusion: The State-based Function Call approach provides more efficient and accurate control for intelligent vehicle cockpits by maintaining explicit state awareness, representing a significant advancement over traditional stateless function calling methods.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment
for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties
with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on
Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.

*Shashidhar Reddy Javaji,Bhavul Gauri,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evaluation framework for measuring iterative refinement in LLMs across ideation, code, and math tasks, showing domain-dependent patterns and effectiveness of targeted vs vague feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of clear measurement for when iteration helps vs hurts in multi-turn LLM workflows, requiring systematic evaluation across different domains.

Method: 12-turn controlled conversations per task with various prompts (vague feedback to targeted steering), domain-appropriate scoring (unit tests, answer-equivalence, originality), and three metric families tracking semantic movement, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth.

Result: Gains are domain-dependent: early turns matter for ideas/code, late turns matter for math with elaboration; vague feedback plateaus/reverses correctness while targeted prompts reliably improve quality; consistent domain patterns in semantic movement and output growth.

Conclusion: Framework makes iteration measurable and comparable across models, providing signals for when to steer, stop, or switch strategies in multi-turn LLM workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we
still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We
present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation,
code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task,
utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to
targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with
domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus
reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and
track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement
across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and
tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in
math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,
vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts
reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;
speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and
drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation
moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little
semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,
elaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration
measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or
switch strategies.

### [45] [RAFFLES: Reasoning-based Attribution of Faults for LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06822)
*Chenyang Zhu,Spencer Hong,Jingyu Wu,Kushal Chawla,Charlotte Tang,Youbing Yin,Nathan Wolfe,Erin Babinsky,Daben Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAFFLES is an iterative evaluation architecture that uses reasoning and refinement to identify failures in long-horizon LLM agentic systems, significantly outperforming existing baselines in fault detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLM agentic systems are limited to single metrics and end-to-end outcomes, making it difficult to identify where and why complex multi-component systems fail over long horizons.

Method: RAFFLES operates as an iterative pipeline with a central Judge that investigates faults and specialized Evaluators that assess both system components and the Judge's reasoning quality, building a history of hypotheses.

Result: RAFFLES achieved over 43% accuracy on Algorithmically-Generated dataset (vs previous best 16.6%) and over 20% on Hand-Crafted dataset (vs previous best 8.8%) in agent-step fault pair detection.

Conclusion: RAFFLES represents a significant advancement in automated fault detection for autonomous systems, moving beyond labor-intensive manual review and enabling systematic diagnosis of complex agent failures.

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

### [46] [Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models Is Not Effective for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks Yet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06861)
*James Xu Zhao,Bryan Hooi,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Test-time scaling (increasing inference computation for longer reasoning chains) doesn't consistently improve accuracy on knowledge-intensive tasks and often increases hallucinations, though it remains beneficial compared to no thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether test-time scaling, which has shown strong performance in other domains, is effective for knowledge-intensive tasks where factual accuracy and low hallucination rates are critical.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive benchmarks, analyzing how extended reasoning affects hallucination behavior through case studies and behavioral analysis.

Result: Increasing test-time computation doesn't consistently improve accuracy and often leads to more hallucinations. Reduced hallucinations come from models choosing to abstain rather than improved factual recall, while longer reasoning can induce confirmation bias and overconfident hallucinations.

Conclusion: While test-time scaling remains beneficial compared to no thinking, it has limitations for knowledge-intensive tasks as it doesn't consistently improve factual accuracy and can increase hallucination rates through various negative behavioral patterns.

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

*Jiacheng Miao,Joe R. Davis,Jonathan K. Pritchard,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper2Agent is an automated framework that converts research papers into AI agents that act as knowledgeable research assistants, enabling natural language interaction with paper methods and workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional research papers require substantial effort to understand and adapt code/data/methods, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. The goal is to transform passive research artifacts into active systems.

Method: Systematically analyzes papers and associated codebases using multiple agents to construct Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine the MCP. Paper MCPs connect to chat agents for natural language queries.

Result: Successfully created agents leveraging AlphaGenome for genomic variant interpretation, and agents based on ScanPy and TISSUE for single-cell/spatial transcriptomics analyses. Agents can reproduce original results and handle novel user queries.

Conclusion: Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for knowledge dissemination by turning static papers into dynamic, interactive AI agents, creating a foundation for collaborative AI co-scientists.

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own
work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this
challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into
dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for
knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI
co-scientists.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Direct-Align method with Semantic Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO) improves diffusion model alignment with human preferences by avoiding expensive multistep denoising and enabling online reward adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aligning diffusion models with human preferences suffer from computational expense of multistep denoising and require continuous offline reward model adaptation for desired aesthetic quality.

Method: Proposes Direct-Align method that predefines noise prior to recover original images via interpolation, avoiding over-optimization. Introduces SRPO for text-conditioned reward signals that enable online adjustment through positive/negative prompt augmentation.

Result: Fine-tuned FLUX.1.dev model shows over 3x improvement in human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses computational limitations and offline adaptation requirements of previous methods, significantly improving diffusion model alignment with human preferences.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning
diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However,
they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with
gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,
thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often
need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired
aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address
the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that
predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time
steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are
interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids
over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic
Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as
text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in
response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the
reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model
with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its
human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.

*James Mooney,Josef Woldense,Zheng Robert Jia,Shirley Anugrah Hayati,My Ha Nguyen,Vipul Raheja,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents show significant internal inconsistencies across different experimental settings, failing to maintain behavioral consistency despite generating human-like survey responses, which limits their ability to substitute real human participants in research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLM-based synthetic agents can truly substitute real human participants in research by examining their internal consistency across different experimental settings, rather than just matching human survey responses.

Method: Developed a study to (a) reveal agents' internal states and (b) examine their behavior in basic dialogue settings, testing behavioral hypotheses to assess consistency between conversation behavior and revealed internal states across various LLM families and sizes.

Result: Found significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across different model families and sizes. While agents can generate responses matching human counterparts, they fail to maintain internal consistency in different experimental contexts.

Conclusion: LLM agents' lack of internal consistency represents a critical limitation in their capability to accurately substitute for real human participants in research, despite their ability to produce human-like survey responses.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

### [50] [Standard vs. Modular Sampling: Best Practices for Reliable LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05316)
*Praveen Bushipaka,Lucia Passaro,Tommaso Cucinotta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper critically examines common practices in LLM unlearning, revealing that single neighbor sets and standard sampling methods are suboptimal, and proposes a modular entity-level unlearning strategy with diverse neighbor sets for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM unlearning benchmarks use simplified settings with single neighbor sets and standard sampling methods that don't reflect real-world data complexities, and their efficacy hasn't been properly evaluated.

Method: Systematic evaluation of common unlearning practices, followed by proposal of Modular Entity-Level Unlearning (MELU) strategy that incorporates diverse neighbor sets and avoids inefficient standard sampling approaches.

Result: Found that single neighbor sets are suboptimal, standard sampling methods are inefficient and yield poor results, and that the proposed MELU approach provides better balance between forget efficacy and model utility with stable performance.

Conclusion: The study establishes best practices for LLM unlearning including diverse neighbor sets, avoiding standard 1:1 sampling, and using modular entity-level unlearning strategies for more effective and stable unlearning outcomes.

Abstract: A conventional LLM Unlearning setting consists of two subsets -"forget" and
"retain", with the objectives of removing the undesired knowledge from the
forget set while preserving the remaining knowledge from the retain. In
privacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into
neighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget
targets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in
existing benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general
knowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and
relationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic
iteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto
standards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically
evaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single
neighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure
performance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an
initial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to
balance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods
are inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level
Unlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling. We demonstrate
that this modular approach, combined with robust algorithms, provides a clear
and stable path towards effective unlearning.

*Xiang Yuan,Jun Shu,Deyu meng,Zongben Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel robust fine-tuning method that preserves out-of-distribution robustness by constraining function space distance and adding consistency regularization, outperforming existing methods across various CLIP backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust fine-tuning methods that preserve pretrained weights, features, or logits cannot consistently improve OOD robustness across different model architectures, as they serve as poor proxies for function space optimization needed for stable predictions.

Method: Proposes two regularizations: 1) constrains the distance between fine-tuning and pre-trained models in function space using simulated OOD samples, and 2) adds consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of perturbed samples.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach consistently improves both in-distribution fine-tuning performance and OOD robustness across various CLIP backbones, outperforming existing regularization-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed function space regularization approach effectively preserves pre-trained model's OOD robustness while achieving competitive downstream task performance, demonstrating superior performance over weight/feature/logit preservation methods.

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

*Jie Fu,Hong Yuan,Zhili Chen,Wendy Hui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNNs are vulnerable to topology privacy attacks that can reconstruct training graph structures from black-box model access. Existing edge-level privacy methods are inadequate, so we propose PGR - a bi-level optimization defense that generates synthetic graphs to protect topology while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks raise serious privacy concerns, particularly around topology privacy (confidentiality of graph structure), which is underexplored compared to edge-level privacy. Current defenses fail to protect against graph-level inference attacks.

Method: Proposed Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) to demonstrate vulnerability, then introduced Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR) - a bi-level optimization framework that iteratively generates synthetic training graphs using meta-gradients while updating the GNN model.

Result: GNNs are highly susceptible to topology inference attacks. PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with minimal impact on model accuracy, outperforming existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms.

Conclusion: Topology privacy is a critical threat in GNNs that requires specialized defenses. PGR provides an effective solution that protects graph structure confidentiality while maintaining model utility, addressing a gap in current privacy protection approaches.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning
from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised
serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on
edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology
privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work,
we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing
their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a
suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure
of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our
findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that
existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they
either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To
address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a
novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining
model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a
synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the
GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with
minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is anonymously available at

TL;DR: memTrace framework uses internal representations (hidden states and attention patterns) to detect membership in LLMs, achieving 0.85 AUC, showing that internal behaviors reveal training data exposure even when outputs appear protected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies suggest MIAs perform only marginally better than random guessing against LLMs, but the authors hypothesize that examining internal representations rather than just outputs may reveal stronger membership inference signals.

Method: memTrace framework analyzes transformer hidden states and attention patterns, examining layer-wise representation dynamics, attention distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns to detect memorization fingerprints.

Result: Achieves strong membership detection with average AUC scores of 0.85 across several model families on popular MIA benchmarks, significantly outperforming traditional loss-based approaches.

Conclusion: Internal model behaviors can reveal training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected, highlighting the need for further research into membership privacy and more robust privacy-preserving training techniques.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) reveal whether specific data was used to
train machine learning models, serving as important tools for privacy auditing
and compliance assessment. Recent studies have reported that MIAs perform only
marginally better than random guessing against large language models,
suggesting that modern pre-training approaches with massive datasets may be
free from privacy leakage risks. Our work offers a complementary perspective to
these findings by exploring how examining LLMs' internal representations,
rather than just their outputs, may provide additional insights into potential
membership inference signals. Our framework, \emph{memTrace}, follows what we
call \enquote{neural breadcrumbs} extracting informative signals from
transformer hidden states and attention patterns as they process candidate
sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representation dynamics, attention
distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns, we detect
potential memorization fingerprints that traditional loss-based approaches may
not capture. This approach yields strong membership detection across several
model families achieving average AUC scores of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks.
Our findings suggest that internal model behaviors can reveal aspects of
training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected,
highlighting the need for further research into membership privacy and the
development of more robust privacy-preserving training techniques for large
language models.

TL;DR: Spotify uses contextual bandits to dynamically balance content types (music, podcasts, audiobooks) on Home page based on user context and preferences, overcoming historical music bias and improving engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical data is heavily skewed toward music, making it challenging to deliver balanced and personalized content mix. Users' content preferences vary by time of day, day of week, and device used.

Method: Proposed calibration method using contextual bandits to dynamically learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and preferences, rather than relying on historical averages.

Result: Both offline and online results demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with Spotify Home page, particularly with under-represented content types like podcasts.

Conclusion: Contextual bandits effectively adapt to users' varying interests across different contexts, boosting engagement and providing better content balance compared to traditional calibration methods.

Abstract: Spotify's Home page features a variety of content types, including music,
podcasts, and audiobooks. However, historical data is heavily skewed toward
music, making it challenging to deliver a balanced and personalized content
mix. Moreover, users' preference towards different content types may vary
depending on the time of day, the day of week, or even the device they use. We
propose a calibration method that leverages contextual bandits to dynamically
learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and
preferences. Unlike traditional calibration methods that rely on historical
averages, our approach boosts engagement by adapting to how users interests in
different content types varies across contexts. Both offline and online results
demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with the Spotify Home page,
in particular with under-represented content types such as podcasts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLanTS is a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework for multivariate time series that models irregular latent states and transitions through multi-granularity patching, contrastive learning, and next-transition prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised learning methods for multivariate time series neglect periodic structures and fail to capture dynamic evolution of latent states, while facing challenges of high dimensionality, limited labeled data, and non-stationary nature.

Method: Proposes period-aware multi-granularity patching, generalized contrastive loss for instance-level and state-level similarities, and next-transition prediction pretext task to capture temporal dynamics and state evolution.

Result: PLanTS consistently improves representation quality over existing SSL methods and demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods across multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed periodicity-aware framework effectively addresses the limitations of current SSL approaches by explicitly modeling irregular latent states and transitions, leading to improved performance in various time series analysis tasks.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) are ubiquitous in domains such as healthcare,
climate science, and industrial monitoring, but their high dimensionality,
limited labeled data, and non-stationary nature pose significant challenges for
conventional machine learning methods. While recent self-supervised learning
(SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time
point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure
of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose
PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly
models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a
period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive
loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across
multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design
a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to
encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS
across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label
classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS
consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and
demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using Signal Temporal Logic specifications to train Biomolecular Neural Networks for biological regression and control tasks without requiring target data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Biomolecular Neural Networks is challenging due to lack of target data, so STL specifications provide alternative training objectives.

Method: Leverage Signal Temporal Logic quantitative semantics for gradient-based optimization of BNN weights, enabling regression and control tasks in biological systems.

Result: Numerical experiments show STL-based learning efficiently solves regression tasks (dysregulated state reporting) and feedback control tasks (chronic disease management).

Conclusion: STL specifications enable effective training of BNNs for biological applications where traditional target data is unavailable.

Abstract: Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with
biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function
approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training
BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we
propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define
training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL,
enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a
learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in
biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in
which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback
control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease
model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to
external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based
learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.

*Maksim Kazanskii,Artem Kasianov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework that uses training data embeddings to filter low-confidence predictions without retraining, improving classification accuracy by detecting out-of-distribution samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how training data distribution affects model performance and develop a method to assess prediction confidence on unseen data without requiring model retraining.

Method: Analyze training set embeddings to measure distance from training distribution, filter low-confidence predictions based on embedding distance, and use multiple embedding models for robust confidence estimation.

Result: Significant improvement in classification accuracy across multiple model architectures, with further gains achieved by combining complementary embeddings for better out-of-distribution detection.

Conclusion: The proposed model-agnostic framework effectively improves prediction reliability by leveraging embedding space analysis, with potential applications extending beyond computer vision to domains like NLP.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of training data distribution on the
performance of image classification models. By analyzing the embeddings of the
training set, we propose a framework to understand the confidence of model
predictions on unseen data without the need for retraining. Our approach
filters out low-confidence predictions based on their distance from the
training distribution in the embedding space, significantly improving
classification accuracy. We demonstrate this on the example of several
classification models, showing consistent performance gains across
architectures. Furthermore, we show that using multiple embedding models to
represent the training data enables a more robust estimation of confidence, as
different embeddings capture complementary aspects of the data. Combining these
embeddings allows for better detection and exclusion of out-of-distribution
samples, resulting in further accuracy improvements. The proposed method is
model-agnostic and generalizable, with potential applications beyond computer
vision, including domains such as Natural Language Processing where prediction
reliability is critical.

TL;DR: First deployment of Mamba-based neural architecture on resource-constrained microcontrollers with 83% memory reduction and 100% accuracy preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying Mamba models on MCUs is challenging due to limited memory, lack of native operator support, and absence of embedded-friendly toolchains.

Method: Developed MambaLite-Micro - a fully C-based runtime-free inference engine that exports PyTorch model weights to lightweight format and implements handcrafted Mamba layer with operator fusion and memory layout optimization.

Conclusion: Successfully deployed Mamba models on ESP32S3 and STM32H7 microcontrollers, demonstrating portability and paving the way for advanced sequence models in resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Deploying Mamba models on microcontrollers (MCUs) remains challenging due to
limited memory, the lack of native operator support, and the absence of
embedded-friendly toolchains. We present, to our knowledge, the first
deployment of a Mamba-based neural architecture on a resource-constrained MCU,
a fully C-based runtime-free inference engine: MambaLite-Micro. Our pipeline
maps a trained PyTorch Mamba model to on-device execution by (1) exporting
model weights into a lightweight format, and (2) implementing a handcrafted
Mamba layer and supporting operators in C with operator fusion and memory
layout optimization. MambaLite-Micro eliminates large intermediate tensors,
reducing 83.0% peak memory, while maintaining an average numerical error of
only 1.7x10-5 relative to the PyTorch Mamba implementation. When evaluated on
keyword spotting(KWS) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks,
MambaLite-Micro achieved 100% consistency with the PyTorch baselines, fully
preserving classification accuracy. We further validated portability by
deploying on both ESP32S3 and STM32H7 microcontrollers, demonstrating
consistent operation across heterogeneous embedded platforms and paving the way
for bringing advanced sequence models like Mamba to real-world

*Peixuan Han,Adit Krishnan,Gerald Friedland,Jiaxuan You,Chris Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAR (self-aligned reward) is a new self-guided signal that complements binary verifiable rewards to improve both reasoning accuracy and efficiency in LLMs by favoring concise, query-specific responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verifiable rewards provide only binary correctness feedback, leading to inefficient verbose reasoning and high computational costs while often compromising accuracy.

Method: SAR is defined as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on the query and the standalone answer, favoring responses that are concise and query-specific.

Result: Integration with RL algorithms (PPO, GRPO) improves accuracy by 4% while reducing inference cost by 30%, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness and efficiency.

Conclusion: SAR effectively suppresses unnecessary elaboration without losing critical reasoning, serving as a fine-grained complement to verifiable rewards for more efficient and effective LLM training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but such signals remain coarse,
offering only binary correctness feedback. This limitation often results in
inefficiencies, including overly verbose reasoning and high computational cost,
while existing solutions often compromise accuracy. To address this, we
introduce self-aligned reward (SAR), a self-guided signal that complements
verifiable rewards to encourage both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. SAR is
defined as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on
the query and the standalone answer, thereby favoring responses that are
concise and query-specific. Quantitative analysis reveals that SAR reliably
distinguishes answer quality: concise, correct answers score higher than
redundant ones, and partially correct answers score higher than entirely
incorrect ones. Evaluation on 4 models across 7 benchmarks shows that
integrating SAR with prevalent RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO improves
accuracy by 4%, while reducing inference cost by 30%. Further analysis
demonstrates that SAR achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness
and efficiency compared to reward signals based on length or self-confidence.
We also show that SAR shortens responses while preserving advanced reasoning
behaviors, demonstrating its ability to suppress unnecessary elaboration
without losing critical reasoning. These results highlight the promise of
self-aligned reward as a fine-grained complement to verifiable rewards, paving
the way for more efficient and effective LLM training.

*Yang Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLA (Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation) is a hierarchical RL framework that uses a low-level goal-conditioned policy and high-level anticipation model with value geometric consistency for stable long-horizon task solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of hierarchical RL in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks, particularly the instability and lack of theoretical guarantees in automatic hierarchy discovery and multi-level policy training.

Method: Learn two synergistic models: a low-level goal-conditioned policy for reaching subgoals, and a high-level anticipation model that plans intermediate subgoals using value geometric consistency regularization to prevent degenerate solutions.

Result: Theoretical proofs show RLA approaches globally optimal policy under various conditions, establishing a principled and convergent method for hierarchical planning.

Conclusion: RLA provides a scalable framework with theoretical guarantees for solving long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks through synergistic hierarchical models with anticipation and geometric consistency.

Abstract: Solving long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks remains a significant challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)
addresses this by decomposing tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, but the
automatic discovery of the hierarchy and the joint training of multi-level
policies often suffer from instability and can lack theoretical guarantees. In
this paper, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation (RLA), a
principled and potentially scalable framework designed to address these
limitations. The RLA agent learns two synergistic models: a low-level,
goal-conditioned policy that learns to reach specified subgoals, and a
high-level anticipation model that functions as a planner, proposing
intermediate subgoals on the optimal path to a final goal. The key feature of
RLA is the training of the anticipation model, which is guided by a principle
of value geometric consistency, regularized to prevent degenerate solutions. We
present proofs that RLA approaches the globally optimal policy under various
conditions, establishing a principled and convergent method for hierarchical
planning and execution in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProfilingAgent uses LLMs to automate model compression via profiling-guided pruning and quantization, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than uniform heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models face compute and memory bottlenecks on resource-limited platforms, and existing compression techniques use uniform heuristics that ignore architectural heterogeneity.

Method: A multi-agent system using LLMs to reason over static metrics (MACs, parameters) and dynamic signals (latency, memory) for architecture-specific pruning and quantization strategies.

Result: Maintains competitive accuracy (1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on smaller datasets), achieves 74% memory savings with <0.5% accuracy loss, and 1.74x inference speedup.

Conclusion: Agentic systems are scalable solutions for profiling-guided model optimization, with LLM reasoning quality being crucial for effective compression.

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causal framework for medical multimodal learning that addresses missingness and distribution biases through structural causal analysis, missingness deconfounding, and dual-branch feature disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world medical datasets often have missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient constraints, and existing methods neglect the underlying bias from data acquisition processes that hinder model generalization.

Method: Structural causal analysis of data-generating process with two components: (1) missingness deconfounding module using backdoor adjustment for causal intervention, and (2) dual-branch neural network to disentangle causal features from spurious correlations.

Result: Evaluated on real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and providing causal insights.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully addresses missingness and distribution biases in medical multimodal representation learning, improving generalization and offering causal understanding.

Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous
clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive
modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data
mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from
missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints.
Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available
observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically
neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself.
In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization:
missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality
availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that
influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we
perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose
a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based
multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a
missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on
backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly
disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our
method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness and causal insights.

TL;DR: OptiProxy-NAS is a novel neural architecture search method that reformulates the discrete NAS space into a continuous, differentiable optimization problem using proxy representations, enabling gradient-based search with superior efficiency and results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural architecture search is computationally expensive with discrete, vast search spaces. Current methods use surrogate models or supernetworks, but there's a need for more efficient end-to-end optimization approaches.

Method: Proposes an optimization proxy that transforms NAS space into continuous, differentiable representation, allowing application of any differentiable optimization method for gradient-based architecture search.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on 12 NAS tasks across 4 search spaces in computer vision, NLP, and resource-constrained domains show superior search results and efficiency. Also verified flexibility in low-fidelity scenarios.

Conclusion: OptiProxy-NAS provides an effective end-to-end optimization framework that streamlines NAS by making the search space continuous and differentiable, demonstrating strong performance across multiple domains and scenarios.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hard computationally expensive
optimization problem with a discrete, vast, and spiky search space. One of the
key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via
certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent
predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture
search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the
NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In
particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be
continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable
optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed
architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$
search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural
language processing, and resource-constrained NAS fully demonstrate the
superior search results and efficiency. Further experiments on low-fidelity
scenarios verify the flexibility.

*Lucas Correia,Jan-Christoph Goos,Thomas Bäck,Anna V. Kononova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active learning approach for time series anomaly detection that integrates unsupervised methods with selective label queries using a novel dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS) to improve threshold selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods suffer from poor threshold setting, and those claiming to be unsupervised often require labeled data for calibration, which is not available in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes DQS query strategy that maximizes diversity of queried samples by evaluating similarity between anomaly scores using dynamic time warping, then uses these labels to refine threshold selection.

Result: DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, other strategies are more robust to mislabelling, but all query strategies outperform unsupervised thresholds even with mislabelling.

Conclusion: Active learning-based threshold selection is recommended whenever feasible, with query strategy choice depending on oracle expertise and labeling budget.

Abstract: Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in
the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which
hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be
unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is
often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning
with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying
the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the
threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query
strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to
maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between
anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance
of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of
mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings
indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others
appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real
world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and
the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query
strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of
mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an
active learning-based threshold is recommended.

TL;DR: GraMFedDHAR: Graph-based multimodal federated learning framework for human activity recognition using sensor data, achieving better accuracy and robustness under differential privacy constraints compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in HAR including noisy/incomplete multimodal sensor data, limited labeled examples, privacy concerns, and limitations of traditional centralized approaches and standard federated learning with heterogeneous data.

Method: Model diverse sensor streams as modality-specific graphs, process through residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fuse via attention-based weighting. Incorporate differential privacy during federated aggregation.

Result: MultiModalGCN outperforms baseline MultiModalFFN by up to 2% higher accuracy in non-DP settings, and shows significant improvements (7-13% gaps) under differential privacy constraints across various privacy budgets.

Conclusion: Graph-based modeling with GNNs provides robustness in multimodal learning, demonstrating greater resilience to performance degradation from DP noise compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains
challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled
examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning
approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network
latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses
privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still
has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and
differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal
Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse
sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple
accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through
residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via
attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused
embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy
safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that
the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with
up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and
federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed
under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses
MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on
the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of
graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to
the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.

TL;DR: A distributed training method combining data parallelism and decoupled backpropagation to accelerate DNN training by using multiple computational units to process more data per iteration while avoiding locking issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks require substantial training time due to increasing depth and large datasets, creating a need for more efficient training methods.

Method: Integrates data parallelism with fully decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm using multiple computational units operating in parallel to enhance data processing and mitigate locking issues.

Result: The method is proven to converge to critical points under certain conditions and shows effectiveness in empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10 classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed distributed training approach significantly improves training efficiency for deep neural networks while maintaining convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Despite the notable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving complex
tasks, the training process still remains considerable challenges. A primary
obstacle is the substantial time required for training, particularly as high
performing DNNs tend to become increasingly deep (characterized by a larger
number of hidden layers) and require extensive training datasets. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a distributed training method that
integrates two prominent strategies for accelerating deep learning: data
parallelism and fully decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm. By
utilizing multiple computational units operating in parallel, the proposed
approach enhances the amount of training data processed in each iteration while
mitigating locking issues commonly associated with the backpropagation
algorithm. These features collectively contribute to significant improvements
in training efficiency. The proposed distributed training method is rigorously
proven to converge to critical points under certain conditions. Its
effectiveness is further demonstrated through empirical evaluations, wherein an
DNN is trained to perform classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

TL;DR: Proposes using convex-concave procedure (CCP) to train morphological perceptron with competitive layer (MPCL) networks, formulating training as difference of convex functions solved via iterative linear programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Morphological perceptrons use mathematical morphology operations that are non-differentiable, making gradient-based optimization unsuitable. Alternative training methods are needed for MPCL networks.

Method: Formulate training as difference of convex (DC) functions and solve iteratively using convex-concave procedure (CCP), resulting in sequence of linear programming subproblems.

Result: Computational experiments demonstrate effectiveness of proposed CCP training method for classification tasks with MPCL networks.

Conclusion: CCP provides an effective gradient-free optimization approach for training morphological neural networks with non-differentiable operations.

Abstract: A morphological perceptron is a multilayer feedforward neural network in
which neurons perform elementary operations from mathematical morphology. For
multiclass classification tasks, a morphological perceptron with a competitive
layer (MPCL) is obtained by integrating a winner-take-all output layer into the
standard morphological architecture. The non-differentiability of morphological
operators renders gradient-based optimization methods unsuitable for training
such networks. Consequently, alternative strategies that do not depend on
gradient information are commonly adopted. This paper proposes the use of the
convex-concave procedure (CCP) for training MPCL networks. The training problem
is formulated as a difference of convex (DC) functions and solved iteratively
using CCP, resulting in a sequence of linear programming subproblems.
Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
training method in addressing classification tasks with MPCL networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First-principles models often fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions, while deep learning requires large datasets. There's a need for methods that can efficiently learn complex dynamics with limited data.

Method: SimPEL uses low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning, combining first-principles models with data-driven learning while quantifying epistemic uncertainty.

Result: Superior performance in learning complex dynamics across biological, agricultural, and robotic domains. On a high-speed RC car task, it learned dynamic parking maneuvers with drifting using substantially less data than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: SimPEL demonstrates strong potential for data-efficient learning and control in complex real-world environments, effectively bridging the sim-to-real gap in model-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: How do we enable AI systems to efficiently learn in the real-world?
First-principles models are widely used to simulate natural systems, but often
fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions. In
contrast, deep learning approaches can estimate complex dynamics with minimal
assumptions but require large, representative datasets. We propose SimPEL, a
method that efficiently combines first-principles models with data-driven
learning by using low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning.
This enables SimPEL to benefit from simulator knowledge in low-data regimes and
leverage deep learning's flexibility when more data is available, all the while
carefully quantifying epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate SimPEL on diverse
systems, including biological, agricultural, and robotic domains, showing
superior performance in learning complex dynamics. For decision-making, we
demonstrate that SimPEL bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based
reinforcement learning. On a high-speed RC car task, SimPEL learns a highly
dynamic parking maneuver involving drifting with substantially less data than
state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the potential of SimPEL for
data-efficient learning and control in complex real-world environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online agents outperform offline agents in model-based reinforcement learning due to encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. Limited offline dataset coverage causes imagination-reality mismatch, but additional online interactions or exploration data can restore performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effects of online vs. offline data collection on world models in model-based reinforcement learning, as the performance differences and underlying causes haven't been thoroughly studied despite the apparent suitability of offline training for task-agnostic dynamics learning.

Method: Conducted experiments on 31 different environments comparing online and offline training paradigms. Analyzed performance degradation causes and tested mitigation strategies including additional online interactions (fixed/adaptive schedules) and incorporating exploration data into offline datasets.

Result: Online agents consistently outperformed offline counterparts. Identified key issue: offline agents encounter Out-Of-Distribution states due to limited state space coverage in datasets, causing imagination-reality mismatch. Additional online interactions restored online training performance with limited data. Exploration data helped mitigate performance degradation.

Conclusion: Recommend adding exploration data when collecting large datasets, as current efforts focus too much on expert data alone. Offline training suffers from state distribution mismatch issues that can be mitigated through strategic online interactions or diverse data collection.

Abstract: Data collection is crucial for learning robust world models in model-based
reinforcement learning. The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect
trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or
training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning
task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for
effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on
world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been
thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both
paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different
environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline
counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of
offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This
issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,
offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between
the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We
demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online
interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of
online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that
incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of
offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data
when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on
expert data alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two major obstacles in anomaly detection: extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality, building on previous work with PRC classification trees and PRC Random Forest.

Method: Integrates PRC Random Forest with autoencoders - unsupervised ML methods that learn compact latent representations - to handle both class imbalance and high dimensionality simultaneously.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets show superior accuracy, scalability, and interpretability compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The Autoencoder-PRC-RF model demonstrates strong potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks by effectively addressing both class imbalance and dimensionality challenges.

Abstract: Anomaly detection underpins critical applications from network security and
intrusion detection to fraud prevention, where recognizing aberrant patterns
rapidly is indispensable. Progress in this area is routinely impeded by two
obstacles: extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality. To combat
the former, we previously introduced Precision-Recall Curve (PRC)
classification trees and their ensemble extension, the PRC Random Forest
(PRC-RF). Building on that foundation, we now propose a hybrid framework that
integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders, unsupervised machine learning methods that
learn compact latent representations, to confront both challenges
simultaneously. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the resulting Autoencoder-PRC-RF model achieves superior

Abstract: Energy forecasting is vital for grid reliability and operational efficiency.
Although recent advances in time series forecasting have led to progress,
existing benchmarks remain limited in spatial and temporal scope and lack
multi-energy features. This raises concerns about their reliability and
applicability in real-world deployment. To address this, we present the Real-E

10-year span with rich metadata. Using Real- E, we conduct an extensive data
analysis and benchmark over 20 baselines across various model types. We
introduce a new metric to quantify shifts in correlation structures and show
that existing methods struggle on our dataset, which exhibits more complex and
non-stationary correlation dynamics. Our findings highlight key limitations of

### [73] [DCV-ROOD Evaluation Framework: Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05778)
*Arantxa Urrea-Castaño,Nicolás Segura-Kunsagi,Juan Luis Suárez-Díaz,Rosana Montes,Francisco Herrera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DCV-ROOD, a dual cross-validation framework for robust evaluation of OOD detection methods that handles in-distribution and out-of-distribution data differently and considers class hierarchy for fair partitioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution detection is crucial for AI robustness but challenging to evaluate properly. Cross-validation needs adaptation for OOD scenarios to provide reliable performance estimates.

Method: Dual CV framework that partitions ID data conventionally while grouping OOD data by classes, with special consideration for class hierarchy to create fair ID-OOD partitions.

Result: The framework achieves very fast convergence to true performance when tested on state-of-the-art OOD detection methods with and without outlier exposure.

Conclusion: DCV-ROOD provides a robust evaluation framework for OOD detection that effectively handles the distinct characteristics of ID and OOD data through appropriate cross-validation adaptations.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the
robustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ
significantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable
predictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable
OOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of
these techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows
researchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to
identify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has
proven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the
performance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular
characteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable
evaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework
for robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the
reliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to
effectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for
their differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using
a conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based
on their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class
hierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy
to obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework.
This framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution
Detection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we
selected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without
outlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast
convergence to the true performance.

### [74] [Select, then Balance: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Exogenous-Aware Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05779)
*Wei Chen,Yuqian Wu,Yuanshao Zhu,Xixuan Hao,Shiyu Wang,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework called ExoST for spatio-temporal forecasting that effectively models exogenous variables through a 'select, then balance' approach using latent space gated experts and siamese networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatio-temporal forecasting solutions only use limited observed target variables, but real-world scenarios have exogenous variables that can improve accuracy. However, challenges include inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables and imbalance between historical and future variables.

Method: ExoST framework with two main components: 1) Latent space gated expert module that projects fused exogenous information into latent space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals, 2) Siamese network architecture with dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones and context-aware weighting mechanism to balance past and future exogenous variables.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency in spatio-temporal forecasting with exogenous variables.

Conclusion: The proposed ExoST framework successfully addresses the challenges of modeling exogenous variables in spatio-temporal forecasting through its innovative 'select, then balance' paradigm, showing significant improvements in forecast accuracy.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic
systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing
solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target
variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into
the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to
promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two
challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the
target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and
future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a
novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in
\underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select,
then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated
expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent
space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized
sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which
recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into
dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs
are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic
balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency
of our proposed framework.

*Debdeep Sanyal,Aaryan Nagpal,Dhruv Kumar,Murari Mandal,Saurabh Deshpande*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer foundation models encode semantic concepts like market regimes, not just curve fitting. Activation transplantation can manipulate hidden states to simulate rare events like market crashes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether transformer-based foundation models internalize semantic concepts like market regimes or merely fit curves, and whether their internal representations can be leveraged to simulate rare high-stakes events such as market crashes.

Method: Activation transplantation - a causal intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing statistical moments of one event (e.g., historical crash) onto another (e.g., calm period) during forward pass.

Result: Injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm semantics suppresses crashes. Models encode graded event severity with latent vector norm correlating with systemic shock magnitude. Validated across Toto (decoder-only) and Chronos (encoder-decoder) architectures.

Conclusion: Large time series transformers have steerable, semantically grounded representations with a latent concept space governing predictions, enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for strategic stress-testing.

Abstract: While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine
patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as
market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be
leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To
investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal
intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments
of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period)
during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts:
injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm
semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we
find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent
vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks.
Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and
Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically
grounded representations are a robust property of large time series
transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that
governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution
to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for
strategic stress-testing.

*Ben Kretzu,Karen Ullrich,Yonathan Efroni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relaxing strong convexity assumptions in aligned multi-objective optimization, proposing gradient-descent algorithms with convergence guarantees under standard smoothness/Lipschitz conditions more relevant to deep learning practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AMOO analysis relies on strong convexity assumptions that imply unique optimal solutions, which doesn't align with real-world deep learning practice where objectives may not be inherently conflicting and diverse tasks can enhance performance.

Method: Develop new analytical tools and metrics for convex AMOO, propose scalable gradient-descent algorithms that work under standard smoothness or Lipschitz continuity conditions rather than strong convexity.

Result: Established convergence guarantees for the proposed algorithms and proved a novel lower bound showing suboptimality of naive equal-weight approaches compared to the new methods.

Conclusion: The work successfully generalizes AMOO analysis to more practical convex settings, providing algorithms and theoretical foundations that better align with real-world deep learning applications where strong convexity assumptions don't hold.

Abstract: It is widely recognized in modern machine learning practice that access to a
diverse set of tasks can enhance performance across those tasks. This
observation suggests that, unlike in general multi-objective optimization, the
objectives in many real-world settings may not be inherently conflicting. To
address this, prior work introduced the Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization
(AMOO) framework and proposed gradient-based algorithms with provable
convergence guarantees. However, existing analysis relies on strong
assumptions, particularly strong convexity, which implies the existence of a
unique optimal solution. In this work, we relax this assumption and study
gradient-descent algorithms for convex AMOO under standard smoothness or
Lipschitz continuity conditions-assumptions more consistent with those used in
deep learning practice. This generalization requires new analytical tools and
metrics to characterize convergence in the convex AMOO setting. We develop such
tools, propose scalable algorithms for convex AMOO, and establish their
convergence guarantees. Additionally, we prove a novel lower bound that
demonstrates the suboptimality of naive equal-weight approaches compared to our
methods.

### [77] [Performance of Conformal Prediction in Capturing Aleatoric Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05826)
*Misgina Tsighe Hagos,Claes Lundström*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conformal prediction sets show weak correlation with human-annotated aleatoric uncertainty, questioning their effectiveness in capturing inherent dataset ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate whether conformal prediction sets effectively quantify aleatoric uncertainty (inherent ambiguity from overlapping classes) as claimed in literature.

Method: Used three conformal prediction approaches on eight deep learning models across four datasets with multiple human annotations per instance. Measured correlation between prediction set sizes and number of distinct human labels, and assessed similarity between prediction sets and human annotations.

Result: Vast majority of conformal prediction outputs showed very weak to weak correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate correlation.

Conclusion: Conformal predictors provide higher coverage of true classes but have limited capability in capturing aleatoric uncertainty, necessitating critical reassessment of their prediction sets.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction
sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction
set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of
evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction
set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are
larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of
this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how
effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically
the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform
this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number
of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess
the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use
three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight
deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations
from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per
instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast
majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak
correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate
correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing
the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can
provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing
aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.

*Akaash Kolluri,Shengguang Wu,Joon Sung Park,Michael S. Bernstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Finetuning LLMs on social science experiment data improves simulation accuracy, achieving 26% better alignment with human responses and outperforming GPT-4o by 13% on unseen studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models can simulate social science experiments, but need improvement in accuracy for reliable hypothesis screening and experimental simulations.

Method: Constructed SocSci210 dataset with 2.9M responses from 400K participants across 210 experiments, then finetuned Qwen2.5-14B model on individual-level response data.

Result: Socrates-Qwen-14B achieved 26% better alignment with human response distributions on unseen studies, 71% improvement on new conditions, and reduced demographic bias by 10.6% compared to base model.

Conclusion: Finetuning LLMs on topic-specific social science datasets enables more accurate experimental simulations, supporting better hypothesis screening in social science research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful opportunity to simulate the
results of social science experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that
finetuning LLMs directly on individual-level responses from past experiments
meaningfully improves the accuracy of such simulations across diverse social
science domains. We construct SocSci210 via an automatic pipeline, a dataset
comprising 2.9 million responses from 400,491 participants in 210 open-source
social science experiments. Through finetuning, we achieve multiple levels of
generalization. In completely unseen studies, our strongest model,
Socrates-Qwen-14B, produces predictions that are 26% more aligned with
distributions of human responses to diverse outcome questions under varying
conditions relative to its base model (Qwen2.5-14B), outperforming GPT-4o by
13%. By finetuning on a subset of conditions in a study, generalization to new
unseen conditions is particularly robust, improving by 71%. Since SocSci210
contains rich demographic information, we reduce demographic parity, a measure
of bias, by 10.6% through finetuning. Because social sciences routinely
generate rich, topic-specific datasets, our findings indicate that finetuning
on such data could enable more accurate simulations for experimental hypothesis
screening. We release our data, models and finetuning code at

TL;DR: A benchmark framework for evaluating gradient aggregation methods in decentralized gradient marketplaces, addressing economic factors like cost-effectiveness, fairness, and market stability that are overlooked in traditional FL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Federated Learning benchmarks fail to consider critical economic and systemic factors unique to decentralized gradient marketplaces, particularly when buyers rely on private baseline datasets for evaluation.

Method: Developed a comprehensive benchmark framework including: (1) simulation environment modeling marketplace dynamics, (2) evaluation methodology with marketplace-centric metrics (Economic Efficiency, Fairness, Selection Dynamics), (3) empirical analysis of MartFL framework with adapted FLTrust and SkyMask aggregation strategies across diverse datasets and attack scenarios.

Result: The benchmark provides tools and empirical evidence to evaluate gradient aggregation methods, analyzing trade-offs between model performance, robustness, cost, fairness, and stability in marketplace settings.

Conclusion: This benchmark enables the community to design more robust, equitable, and economically viable decentralized gradient marketplaces by providing essential evaluation tools and insights into critical marketplace dynamics.

Abstract: The rise of distributed and privacy-preserving machine learning has sparked
interest in decentralized gradient marketplaces, where participants trade
intermediate artifacts like gradients. However, existing Federated Learning
(FL) benchmarks overlook critical economic and systemic factors unique to such
marketplaces-cost-effectiveness, fairness to sellers, and market
stability-especially when a buyer relies on a private baseline dataset for
evaluation.
  We introduce a comprehensive benchmark framework to holistically evaluate
robust gradient aggregation methods within these buyer-baseline-reliant
marketplaces. Our contributions include: (1) a simulation environment modeling
marketplace dynamics with a variable buyer baseline and diverse seller
distributions; (2) an evaluation methodology augmenting standard FL metrics
with marketplace-centric dimensions such as Economic Efficiency, Fairness, and
Selection Dynamics; (3) an in-depth empirical analysis of the existing
Distributed Gradient Marketplace framework, MartFL, including the integration
and comparative evaluation of adapted FLTrust and SkyMask as alternative
aggregation strategies within it. This benchmark spans diverse datasets, local
attacks, and Sybil attacks targeting the marketplace selection process; and (4)
actionable insights into the trade-offs between model performance, robustness,
cost, fairness, and stability.
  This benchmark equips the community with essential tools and empirical
evidence to evaluate and design more robust, equitable, and economically viable

TL;DR: A data-driven framework using autoregressive sequence models to automate queueing network modeling from event-stream data, eliminating the need for manual specification of arrival processes, service mechanisms, or routing logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional queueing network models require substantial human effort and domain expertise to construct, making them less scalable and accessible. The goal is to leverage AI advances and available data to create more automated modeling pipelines.

Method: Proposes using Transformer-style architectures to parameterize conditional distributions of event types and times, treating the modeling task as sequence distribution learning from event-stream data.

Result: The framework enables automated construction of high-fidelity simulators and is validated on diverse queueing networks, demonstrating utility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual evaluation.

Conclusion: This approach represents a step toward more automated, data-driven modeling pipelines that can support broader adoption of queueing network models across various service domains.

Abstract: While queueing network models are powerful tools for analyzing service
systems, they traditionally require substantial human effort and domain
expertise to construct. To make this modeling approach more scalable and
accessible, we propose a data-driven framework for queueing network modeling
and simulation based on autoregressive sequence models trained on event-stream
data. Instead of explicitly specifying arrival processes, service mechanisms,
or routing logic, our approach learns the conditional distributions of event
types and event times, recasting the modeling task as a problem of sequence
distribution learning. We show that Transformer-style architectures can
effectively parameterize these distributions, enabling automated construction
of high-fidelity simulators. As a proof of concept, we validate our framework
on event tables generated from diverse queueing networks, showcasing its
utility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual
evaluation. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and the growing
availability of data, our framework takes a step toward more automated,
data-driven modeling pipelines to support broader adoption of queueing network
models across service domains.

### [81] [The Measure of Deception: An Analysis of Data Forging in Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05865)
*Rishabh Dixit,Yuan Hui,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes adversarial forging in machine unlearning, showing that the set of data points that can forge target gradients has vanishingly small measure, making false unlearning claims detectable in principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy regulations and mitigate harmful data effects by verifying machine unlearning, specifically countering adversarial forging where data mimics target gradients to create false unlearning appearances.

Method: Develop a framework analyzing ε-forging sets (data points whose gradients approximate target gradients within tolerance ε). Analyze Lebesgue measure scaling for linear regression and neural networks, and prove general decay rates under mild regularity assumptions.

Result: Forging set measure scales as O(ε) and O(ε^d) for small ε in specific models. Generally decays as ε^{(d-r)/2} where d is data dimension and r is nullity of variation matrix. Probability bounds show vanishingly small likelihood of random forging.

Conclusion: Adversarial forging is fundamentally limited due to the small measure of forging sets, enabling detection of false unlearning claims and supporting verifiable machine unlearning.

Abstract: Motivated by privacy regulations and the need to mitigate the effects of
harmful data, machine unlearning seeks to modify trained models so that they
effectively ``forget'' designated data. A key challenge in verifying unlearning
is forging -- adversarially crafting data that mimics the gradient of a target
point, thereby creating the appearance of unlearning without actually removing
information. To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data
points whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance
$\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a
framework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural
networks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small. It scales on
the order of $\epsilon$, and when $\epsilon$ is small enough, $\epsilon^d$.
More generally, under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that the forging
set measure decays as $\epsilon^{(d-r)/2}$, where $d$ is the data dimension and
$r<d$ is the nullity of a variation matrix defined by the model gradients.
Extensions to batch SGD and almost-everywhere smooth loss functions yield the
same asymptotic scaling. In addition, we establish probability bounds showing
that, under non-degenerate data distributions, the likelihood of randomly
sampling a forging point is vanishingly small. These results provide evidence
that adversarial forging is fundamentally limited and that false unlearning
claims can, in principle, be detected.

TL;DR: Machine learning models developed to predict sodium heat transfer in miniature heat sinks, achieving ~8% error with physics-informed neural networks, offering efficient alternative to expensive CFD simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity CFD modeling of turbulent forced convection for liquid metals is time-consuming and computationally expensive, requiring alternative efficient tools for design and optimization of liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks.

Method: Used kernel-based ML techniques and shallow neural networks on 87 Nusselt number data points, then developed self-supervised physics-informed neural network with adaptive physics weighting in loss function, and applied transfer learning from water-trained models to sodium.

Result: Self-supervised physics-informed neural network achieved ~8% error margin for heat transfer rate prediction. Physics-only regression maintained 5-10% error. Other ML methods also stayed within ~8% prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Machine learning models provide powerful and efficient alternatives to CFD for predicting convective heat transfer in liquid sodium miniature heat sinks, with physics-informed approaches achieving high accuracy while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: A surrogate model is developed to predict the convective heat transfer
coefficient of liquid sodium (Na) flow within rectangular miniature heat sinks.
Initially, kernel-based machine learning techniques and shallow neural network
are applied to a dataset with 87 Nusselt numbers for liquid sodium in
rectangular miniature heat sinks. Subsequently, a self-supervised
physics-informed neural network and transfer learning approach are used to
increase the estimation performance. In the self-supervised physics-informed
neural network, an additional layer determines the weight the of physics in the
loss function to balance data and physics based on their uncertainty for a
better estimation. For transfer learning, a shallow neural network trained on
water is adapted for use with Na. Validation results show that the
self-supervised physics-informed neural network successfully estimate the heat
transfer rates of Na with an error margin of approximately +8%. Using only
physics for regression, the error remains between 5% to 10%. Other machine
learning methods specify the prediction mostly within +8%. High-fidelity
modeling of turbulent forced convection of liquid metals using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and computationally expensive.
Therefore, machine learning based models offer a powerful alternative tool for
the design and optimization of liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based Text-to-SQL frameworks overlook the critical role of database schema information, which significantly impacts SQL query generation quality.

Method: Proposes X-SQL framework with two components: X-Linking (LLM Supervised Finetuning for schema linking) and X-Admin (schema understanding by bridging schema info with natural language questions). Uses Multi-LLMs for different components to boost performance.

Result: Achieved Execution Accuracies of 84.9% on Spider-Dev and 82.5% on Spider-Test datasets, establishing X-SQL as the leading open-source Text-to-SQL framework.

Conclusion: Database schema information plays a dominant role in Text-to-SQL tasks, and the proposed X-SQL framework with specialized schema components significantly outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: With Large Language Models' (LLMs) emergent abilities on code generation
tasks, Text-to-SQL has become one of the most popular downstream applications.
Despite the strong results of multiple recent LLM-based Text-to-SQL frameworks,
the research community often overlooks the importance of database schema
information for generating high-quality SQL queries. We find that such schema
information plays a significant or even dominant role in the Text-to-SQL task.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel database schema expert with two
components. We first introduce X-Linking, an LLM Supervised Finetuning
(SFT)-based method that achieves superior Schema Linking results compared to
existing open-source Text-to-SQL methods. In addition, we innovatively propose
an X-Admin component that focuses on Schema Understanding by bridging the gap
between abstract schema information and the user's natural language question.
Aside from better learning with schema information, we experiment with
Multi-LLMs for different components within the system to further boost its
performance. By incorporating these techniques into our end-to-end framework,
X-SQL, we have achieved Execution Accuracies of 84.9% on the Spider-Dev dataset
and 82.5% on the Spider-Test dataset. This outstanding performance establishes
X-SQL as the leading Text-to-SQL framework based on open-source models.

TL;DR: SOOTT framework integrates target tracking, adversarial perturbation, and switching costs for online optimization under uncertainty, with algorithms BEST and learning-augmented CoRT that balance performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address real-world scenarios like AI cluster workload scheduling where operators need to balance long-term service agreements against sudden demand spikes while maintaining decision stability.

Method: Introduce SOOTT problem formulation with three cost objectives. Develop BEST algorithm with competitive guarantees, then create CoRT - a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted black-box predictions from ML models.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows CoRT improves over BEST when predictions are accurate while maintaining robustness under arbitrary prediction errors. Case study on workload scheduling validates effectiveness.

Conclusion: SOOTT framework provides effective solution for balancing trajectory tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to disturbances, with CoRT offering practical performance enhancements through learning augmentation.

Abstract: We introduce the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT)
problem, a new framework that integrates three key objectives in online
decision-making under uncertainty: (1) tracking cost for following a
dynamically moving target, (2) adversarial perturbation cost for withstanding
unpredictable disturbances, and (3) switching cost for penalizing abrupt
changes in decisions. This formulation captures real-world scenarios such as
elastic and inelastic workload scheduling in AI clusters, where operators must
balance long-term service-level agreements (e.g., LLM training) against sudden
demand spikes (e.g., real-time inference). We first present BEST, a robust
algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT. To enhance practical
performance, we introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates
untrusted black-box predictions (e.g., from ML models) into its decision
process. Our theoretical analysis shows that CoRT strictly improves over BEST
when predictions are accurate, while maintaining robustness under arbitrary
prediction errors. We validate our approach through a case study on workload
scheduling, demonstrating that both algorithms effectively balance trajectory
tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances.

TL;DR: UIFM is a foundation model that treats multi-attribute events as single semantic units through composite tokenization, enabling better behavioral understanding than text-serialized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models designed for natural language fail to capture the holistic nature of structured interactions in domains like telecommunications, e-commerce, and finance, losing critical context when serializing events into text.

Method: Composite tokenization principle where each multi-attribute event is treated as a single, semantically coherent unit, allowing the model to learn the underlying 'grammar' of user behavior and perceive entire interactions holistically.

Result: The architecture is demonstrated to be more accurate and represents a fundamental step towards creating more adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.

Conclusion: UIFM enables genuine behavioral understanding by preserving event context and structure, moving beyond the limitations of text-serialized approaches for complex event sequence prediction.

Abstract: A central goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems that can
understand and predict complex, evolving sequences of events. However, current
foundation models, designed for natural language, fail to grasp the holistic
nature of structured interactions found in domains like telecommunications,
e-commerce and finance. By serializing events into text, they disassemble them
into semantically fragmented parts, losing critical context. In this work, we
introduce the Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM), a foundation model
engineered for genuine behavioral understanding. At its core is the principle
of composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is treated as a
single, semantically coherent unit. This allows UIFM to learn the underlying
"grammar" of user behavior, perceiving entire interactions rather than a
disconnected stream of data points. We demonstrate that this architecture is
not just more accurate, but represents a fundamental step towards creating more
adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PolicyEvolve is a framework that uses LLMs to generate interpretable programmatic policies for multi-agent games, reducing computational costs and improving policy interpretability through iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MARL requires massive computational resources and produces black-box policies that lack interpretability, limiting practical deployment. LLMs have shown success in generating interpretable policies for single-agent tasks, suggesting potential for multi-agent settings.

Method: Four-module framework: Global Pool (stores elite policies), Local Pool (temporary policies), Policy Planner (generates/refines policies using top policies and environmental info), Trajectory Critic (analyzes vulnerabilities and guides improvements). Iterative process refines policies until high win rates are achieved.

Result: Significantly reduces reliance on manually crafted code and minimizes environmental interactions while achieving high-performance policies. Produces interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.

Conclusion: PolicyEvolve provides an effective approach for generating interpretable programmatic policies in multi-agent games, addressing computational cost and interpretability challenges of traditional MARL methods.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress
in solving complex multi-player games through self-play. However, training
effective adversarial policies requires millions of experience samples and
substantial computational resources. Moreover, these policies lack
interpretability, hindering their practical deployment. Recently, researchers
have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
programmatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based
policies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.
Inspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating
programmatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces
reliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies
with minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules:
Global Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool
preserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool
stores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently
high-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The
Policy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top
three policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the
current iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy
using feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited
into the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves
a sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it
is integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction
data from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes
directional improvements to guide the Policy Planner

TL;DR: ARIES is a framework that establishes relationships between time series properties and modeling strategies, and provides the first deep forecasting model recommendation system for realistic time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmark datasets lack diverse temporal patterns, making it difficult to systematically evaluate the connection between time series properties and model performance. There's also no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high costs when testing different architectures.

Method: Constructed a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, designed a comprehensive system to compute time series properties, and conducted extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models to establish relationships between properties and modeling strategies.

Result: Experimental results revealed clear correlations between time series properties and modeling strategies, enabling the creation of an interpretable deep forecasting model recommender for real-world applications.

Conclusion: ARIES is the first study to systematically establish relationships between time series data properties and modeling strategies while implementing a practical model recommendation system, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have
been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series
properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an
intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing
benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns,
restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there
is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost
expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream
applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing
relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for
recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we
construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a
comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct
an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the
relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our
experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we
propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing
interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the
first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series
data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation
system. The code is available at: https://github.com/blisky-li/ARIES.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A residual neural network surrogate model is developed to predict current density in HTS magnets, achieving faster predictions than FEM with good accuracy and extrapolation capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FEM becomes computationally expensive for large-scale HTS magnet design, especially with multi-physics couplings, limiting rapid design optimization.

Method: Developed a fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) trained on FEM simulation data with varying numbers of turns and pancakes to predict space-time current density distribution.

Result: FCRN with 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer achieved best balance between accuracy and generalization. Model can extrapolate up to 50% beyond training range with <10% error, and is orders of magnitude faster than FEM.

Conclusion: The FCRN-based surrogate model provides accurate and efficient predictions, offering a promising tool for rapid analysis of large-scale HTS magnets.

Abstract: Finite element method (FEM) is widely used in high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) magnets, but its computational cost increases with magnet
size and becomes time-consuming for meter-scale magnets, especially when
multi-physics couplings are considered, which limits the fast design of
large-scale REBCO magnet systems. In this work, a surrogate model based on a
fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) is developed to predict the
space-time current density distribution in REBCO solenoids. Training datasets
were generated from FEM simulations with varying numbers of turns and pancakes.
The results demonstrate that, for deeper networks, the FCRN architecture
achieves better convergence than conventional fully connected network (FCN),
with the configuration of 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer
providing the most favorable balance between training accuracy and
generalization capability. Extrapolation studies show that the model can
reliably predict magnetization losses for up to 50% beyond the training range,
with maximum errors below 10%. The surrogate model achieves predictions several
orders of magnitude faster than FEM and still remains advantageous when
training costs are included. These results indicate that the proposed
FCRN-based surrogate model provides both accuracy and efficiency, offering a
promising tool for the rapid analysis of large-scale HTS magnets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-inconsistent preferences (smaller-sooner over larger-later rewards) are common in human/animal decision-making but quasi-hyperbolic discounting integration into RL has been limited, creating theoretical and algorithmic gaps.

Method: Formal characterization of optimal policy structure and design of practical model-free algorithms for both policy evaluation and Q-learning with quasi-hyperbolic preferences.

Result: Proved that optimal policy reduces to a simple one-step non-stationary form and developed first practical algorithms with provable convergence guarantees for this setting.

Conclusion: Provides foundational insights and practical tools for incorporating quasi-hyperbolic preferences in reinforcement learning, addressing key theoretical and algorithmic challenges.

Abstract: Time-inconsistent preferences, where agents favor smaller-sooner over
larger-later rewards, are a key feature of human and animal decision-making.
Quasi-Hyperbolic (QH) discounting provides a simple yet powerful model for this
behavior, but its integration into the reinforcement learning (RL) framework
has been limited. This paper addresses key theoretical and algorithmic gaps for
precommitted agents with QH preferences. We make two primary contributions: (i)
we formally characterize the structure of the optimal policy, proving for the
first time that it reduces to a simple one-step non-stationary form; and (ii)
we design the first practical, model-free algorithms for both policy evaluation
and Q-learning in this setting, both with provable convergence guarantees. Our
results provide foundational insights for incorporating QH preferences in RL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the fundamental question of what generation is as a distinct machine learning task, moving beyond specific implementations to understand generation's connections to prediction, compression, and decision-making.

Method: Surveys five generative model families (autoregressive models, VAEs, normalizing flows, GANs, diffusion models), introduces probabilistic frameworks distinguishing density estimation from generation, and uses game-theoretic analysis with adversary-learner setups.

Result: Provides a systematic framework for understanding generative AI as a machine learning problem, covering technical foundations, deployment considerations, and social responsibility aspects.

Conclusion: Adopts a task-first approach to generation, emphasizing what generation fundamentally is rather than just how models implement it, while highlighting important societal considerations like privacy, AI content detection, and intellectual property issues.

Abstract: Beginning with text and images, generative AI has expanded to audio, video,
computer code, and molecules. Yet, if generative AI is the answer, what is the
question? We explore the foundations of generation as a distinct machine
learning task with connections to prediction, compression, and decision-making.
We survey five major generative model families: autoregressive models,
variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks,
and diffusion models. We then introduce a probabilistic framework that
emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review
a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study
generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative
models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially
responsible generation such as privacy, detection of AI-generated content, and
copyright and IP. We adopt a task-first framing of generation, focusing on what
generation is as a machine learning problem, rather than only on how models
implement it.

*Dibyajyoti Nayak,Somdatta Goswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) with explicit time-stepping significantly improve data efficiency and reduce error accumulation for PDE solving compared to neural operators, achieving <1% error with only 3% training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators require large datasets and struggle with scarce data, while autoregressive models suffer from error accumulation. Many approaches don't encode causal, local-in-time structure of physical evolution.

Method: Employ Graph Neural Simulators (message-passing GNN framework) with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to model instantaneous time derivatives. Uses PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy for low-data performance.

Result: GNS achieves under 1% relative L2 errors with only 30 training samples (3% of data) across three PDE systems. Reduces autoregressive error by 82.48% vs FNO and 99.86% vs DeepONet. Substantially reduces error accumulation over extended time horizons.

Conclusion: Combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate models for time-dependent PDEs with high data efficiency.

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces but require large datasets and struggle with scarce training
data. Many NO formulations don't explicitly encode causal, local-in-time
structure of physical evolution. While autoregressive models preserve causality
by predicting next time-steps, they suffer from rapid error accumulation. We
employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network
framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to construct accurate
forward models that learn PDE solutions by modeling instantaneous time
derivatives. We evaluate our framework on three canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D
Burgers' scalar equation, (2) 2D coupled Burgers' vector equation, and (3) 2D
Allen-Cahn equation. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate GNS significantly
improves data efficiency, achieving higher generalization accuracy with
substantially fewer training trajectories compared to neural operator baselines
like DeepONet and FNO. GNS consistently achieves under 1% relative L2 errors
with only 30 training samples out of 1000 (3% of available data) across all
three PDE systems. It substantially reduces error accumulation over extended
temporal horizons: averaged across all cases, GNS reduces autoregressive error
by 82.48% relative to FNO AR and 99.86% relative to DON AR. We introduce a
PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy enhancing low-data performance.
Results indicate combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional
time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate
models for time-dependent PDEs.

TL;DR: UWB-based indoor tracking using deep learning with RSSI fingerprinting achieves ~50cm accuracy, with CNN+LSTM hybrid model performing best for human activity recognition in homes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UWB location tracking is affected by walls and obstacles, reducing precision in real home environments. The study aims to improve indoor tracking accuracy for daily human activity recognition.

Method: Fingerprinting approach using RSSI data from UWB and Bluetooth in two flats (60m² and 100m²). Compared CNN, LSTM, and hybrid CNN+LSTM models, and evaluated temporal window types and durations.

Result: Achieved mean absolute error close to 50 cm, with the hybrid CNN+LSTM model showing superior performance in providing accurate location estimates.

Conclusion: The proposed fingerprinting-based approach with hybrid deep learning model facilitates accurate human activity recognition in residential settings, making UWB technology practical for daily use.

Abstract: The field of human activity recognition has evolved significantly, driven
largely by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) device technology,
particularly in personal devices. This study investigates the use of
ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for tracking inhabitant paths in home
environments using deep learning models. UWB technology estimates user
locations via time-of-flight and time-difference-of-arrival methods, which are
significantly affected by the presence of walls and obstacles in real
environments, reducing their precision. To address these challenges, we propose
a fingerprinting-based approach utilizing received signal strength indicator
(RSSI) data collected from inhabitants in two flats (60 m2 and 100 m2) while
performing daily activities. We compare the performance of convolutional neural
network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid CNN+LSTM models, as
well as the use of Bluetooth technology. Additionally, we evaluate the impact
of the type and duration of the temporal window (future, past, or a combination
of both). Our results demonstrate a mean absolute error close to 50 cm,
highlighting the superiority of the hybrid model in providing accurate location
estimates, thus facilitating its application in daily human activity
recognition in residential settings.

*M. Rezaalipour,F. Costa,M. Biasion,R. Otoni,G. A. Constantinides,L. Pozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a methodology to reduce area of neural network arithmetic operators (adders/multipliers) via approximate computing, achieving better area savings than state-of-the-art approaches with same accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying neural networks on edge devices requires balancing energy consumption and classification accuracy. Approximate computing can reduce energy by slightly sacrificing arithmetic operator accuracy.

Method: Improves on XPAT boolean rewriting technique by using parametrizable product sharing template that acts as proxy for synthesized area. Template parameters serve as proxies for chosen metrics.

Result: Methodology converges better to low-area solutions and finds better approximations than original XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed template-based approach with parametrizable product sharing provides superior area savings for neural network arithmetic operators while maintaining comparable accuracy loss.

Abstract: Deploying neural networks on edge devices entails a careful balance between
the energy required for inference and the accuracy of the resulting
classification. One technique for navigating this tradeoff is approximate
computing: the process of reducing energy consumption by slightly reducing the
accuracy of arithmetic operators. In this context, we propose a methodology to
reduce the area of the small arithmetic operators used in neural networks -
i.e., adders and multipliers - via a small loss in accuracy, and show that we
improve area savings for the same accuracy loss w.r.t. the state of the art. To
achieve our goal, we improve on a boolean rewriting technique recently
proposed, called XPAT, where the use of a parametrisable template to rewrite
circuits has proved to be highly beneficial. In particular, XPAT was able to
produce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum
of products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters
can act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on
parametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area.
We demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area
solutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original
XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: Visual analytics framework compares fused vs separate latent representations of urban data, finding fused representations produce more structured patterns while separate ones work better in specific cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban data's granularity, heterogeneity and multimodality present challenges for analysis. While visual analytics tools exist for exploring fused data, there's limited research on whether fused representations actually provide deeper insights than examining data sources separately.

Method: Developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze the effectiveness of fused latent data representations versus separate representations for uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data.

Result: Combined latent representations produce more structured patterns overall, while separate representations are useful in particular cases where individual data sources provide specific insights.

Conclusion: Fused latent representations generally offer better pattern discovery for urban analytics, but separate representations still have value in certain scenarios, suggesting a hybrid approach might be optimal.

Abstract: Urban analytics utilizes extensive datasets with diverse urban information to
simulate, predict trends, and uncover complex patterns within cities. While
these data enables advanced analysis, it also presents challenges due to its
granularity, heterogeneity, and multimodality. To address these challenges,
visual analytics tools have been developed to support the exploration of latent
representations of fused heterogeneous and multimodal data, discretized at a
street-level of detail. However, visualization-assisted tools seldom explore
the extent to which fused data can offer deeper insights than examining each
data source independently within an integrated visualization framework. In this
work, we developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze whether fused
latent data representations are more effective than separate representations in
uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data. The analysis reveals
that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while
separate ones are useful in particular cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reasoning language model (RLM) that integrates radiology findings with medical records for improved lung cancer risk assessment, outperforming standard Lung-RADS by considering multiple risk factors through chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung-RADS has limitations in sensitivity and specificity as it only considers lung nodule characteristics without incorporating various risk factors, necessitating a more comprehensive risk assessment approach.

Method: Developed a reasoning language model that combines radiology findings with longitudinal medical records using dataset construction, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and decomposes risk evaluation into sub-components with a data-driven system equation.

Result: Significant improvements in risk prediction performance on national lung screening trial datasets, with enhanced predictive accuracy and monitorability through chain-of-thought reasoning.

Conclusion: The RLM approach facilitates clinical translation into lung cancer screening by providing more individualized and accurate risk assessment while maintaining interpretability through its reasoning process.

Abstract: Accurate risk assessment in lung cancer screening is critical for enabling
early cancer detection and minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures. The Lung
CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) has been widely used as the
standard framework for patient management and follow-up. Nevertheless,
Lung-RADS faces trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, as it
stratifies risk solely based on lung nodule characteristics without
incorporating various risk factors. Here we propose a reasoning language model
(RLM) to integrate radiology findings with longitudinal medical records for
individualized lung cancer risk assessment. Through a systematic study
including dataset construction and distillation, supervised fine-tuning,
reinforcement learning, and comprehensive evaluation, our model makes
significant improvements in risk prediction performance on datasets in the
national lung screening trial. Notably, RLM can decompose the risk evaluation
task into sub-components, analyze the contributions of diverse risk factors,
and synthesize them into a final risk score computed using our data-driven
system equation. Our approach improves both predictive accuracy and
monitorability through the chain of thought reasoning process, thereby
facilitating clinical translation into lung cancer screening.

TL;DR: NMF and PCC are closely related. PCC helps estimate stable NMF rank and resolve nonidentifiability, while NMF enables approximate PCC implementation for clustering and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the reciprocal relationship between Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and the Principle of the Common Cause (PCC) to enhance both methodologies.

Method: Apply PCC to estimate robust NMF rank and resolve nonidentifiability, while using NMF for approximate PCC implementation, clustering, and denoising on gray-scale image datasets.

Result: PCC provides stable rank estimation for NMF, producing noise-resistant features. NMF enables effective PCC-based clustering and data denoising.

Conclusion: The synergy between NMF and PCC offers mutual benefits: improved rank estimation and feature stability for NMF, and practical implementation of PCC for clustering and denoising applications.

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of different state representation strategies in reinforcement learning for complex rule inference tasks with partial observability.

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning in the Game Of Hidden Rules (GOHR)
environment, a complex puzzle in which an agent must infer and execute hidden
rules to clear a 6$\times$6 board by placing game pieces into buckets. We
explore two state representation strategies, namely Feature-Centric (FC) and
Object-Centric (OC), and employ a Transformer-based Advantage Actor-Critic
(A2C) algorithm for training. The agent has access only to partial observations
and must simultaneously infer the governing rule and learn the optimal policy

Motivation: Current graph clustering methods under differential privacy face challenges including high noise, low efficiency, and poor interpretability, which limit the field's development.

Method: Construct SDP optimization, extract key set using HST-based initialization, apply k-median clustering strategy, and provide comparative explanations through cluster center differences.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in various clustering metrics while strictly ensuring privacy.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses key challenges in differentially private graph clustering by providing better performance, efficiency, and interpretability while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Graph clustering under the framework of differential privacy, which aims to
process graph-structured data while protecting individual privacy, has been
receiving increasing attention. Despite significant achievements in current
research, challenges such as high noise, low efficiency and poor
interpretability continue to severely constrain the development of this field.
In this paper, we construct a differentially private and interpretable graph
clustering approach based on metric embedding initialization. Specifically, we
construct an SDP optimization, extract the key set and provide a
well-initialized clustering configuration using an HST-based initialization
method. Subsequently, we apply an established k-median clustering strategy to
derive the cluster results and offer comparative explanations for the query set
through differences from the cluster centers. Extensive experiments on public

Result: Experiments on public datasets validate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed MCIGLE framework.

Conclusion: MCIGLE successfully addresses key challenges in exemplar-free class-incremental learning for multimodal graph data, demonstrating improved performance in knowledge retention and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning enables models to learn new classes
over time without storing data from old ones. As multimodal graph-structured
data becomes increasingly prevalent, existing methods struggle with challenges
like catastrophic forgetting, distribution bias, memory limits, and weak
generalization. We propose MCIGLE, a novel framework that addresses these
issues by extracting and aligning multimodal graph features and applying
Concatenated Recursive Least Squares for effective knowledge retention. Through
multi-channel processing, MCIGLE balances accuracy and memory preservation.
Experiments on public datasets validate its effectiveness and generalizability.

*Honggang Jia,Xiucheng Wang,Nan Cheng,Ruijin Sun,Changle Li*

TL;DR: UrbanMIMOMap is a large-scale urban MIMO CSI dataset generated via ray tracing to address the lack of comprehensive channel state information data for 6G environment-aware communication research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current public datasets for radio maps focus on SISO systems and limited information like path loss, which is insufficient for advanced MIMO systems requiring detailed CSI in 6G networks.

Method: The dataset was generated using high-precision ray tracing to provide comprehensive complex CSI matrices across a dense spatial grid in urban environments.

Result: UrbanMIMOMap offers rich CSI data that enables high-fidelity radio map construction and serves as a fundamental resource for data-driven methods including deep learning approaches.

Conclusion: This work provides a crucial dataset and reference for research in high-precision radio map generation, MIMO spatial performance analysis, and machine learning applications for 6G environment awareness.

Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) systems require environment-aware communication, driven
by native artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC). Radio maps (RMs), providing spatially continuous channel information,
are key enablers. However, generating high-fidelity RM ground truth via
electromagnetic (EM) simulations is computationally intensive, motivating
machine learning (ML)-based RM construction. The effectiveness of these
data-driven methods depends on large-scale, high-quality training data. Current
public datasets often focus on single-input single-output (SISO) and limited
information, such as path loss, which is insufficient for advanced multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems requiring detailed channel state information (CSI).
To address this gap, this paper presents UrbanMIMOMap, a novel large-scale
urban MIMO CSI dataset generated using high-precision ray tracing. UrbanMIMOMap
offers comprehensive complex CSI matrices across a dense spatial grid, going
beyond traditional path loss data. This rich CSI is vital for constructing
high-fidelity RMs and serves as a fundamental resource for data-driven RM
generation, including deep learning. We demonstrate the dataset's utility
through baseline performance evaluations of representative ML methods for RM
construction. This work provides a crucial dataset and reference for research
in high-precision RM generation, MIMO spatial performance, and ML for 6G
environment awareness. The code and data for this work are available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IPR is an intelligent prompt routing framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs based on predicted response quality and user tolerance levels, achieving 43.9% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Routing queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining response quality is a fundamental challenge for optimizing performance-cost trade-offs in large-scale commercial systems.

Method: IPR uses a modular architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M annotated prompts, user-controlled routing with tolerance parameter τ, and extensible design with frozen encoders and model-specific adapters.

Result: Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR achieves 43.9% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the strongest Claude model, processing requests with sub-150ms latency.

Conclusion: IPR provides an effective solution for intelligent prompt routing that balances quality and cost, with rapid integration capabilities for new models and significant cost savings in production environments.

Abstract: Routing incoming queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining
response quality poses a fundamental challenge in optimizing performance-cost
trade-offs for large-scale commercial systems. We present IPR\, a
quality-constrained Intelligent Prompt Routing framework that dynamically
selects optimal models based on predicted response quality and user-specified
tolerance levels. IPR introduces three key innovations: (1) a modular
architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts
annotated with calibrated quality scores, enabling fine-grained quality
prediction across model families; (2) a user-controlled routing mechanism with
tolerance parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$ that provides explicit control over
quality-cost trade-offs; and (3) an extensible design using frozen encoders
with model-specific adapters, reducing new model integration from days to
hours. To rigorously train and evaluate IPR, we curate an industrial-level
dataset IPRBench\footnote{IPRBench will be released upon legal approval.}, a
comprehensive benchmark containing 1.5 million examples with response quality
annotations across 11 LLM candidates. Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR
achieves 43.9\% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the
strongest model in the Claude family and processes requests with sub-150ms
latency.

*Chang Xue,Youwei Lu,Chen Yang,Jinming Xing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RecMind is an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that combines language model embeddings with graph collaborative filtering through contrastive alignment and gating fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on recommendation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalization systems face challenges with sparse interactions, fast content churn, and heterogeneous textual signals. Existing approaches either rely solely on collaborative filtering or use LLMs as monolithic rankers, missing opportunities to leverage both textual and graph information effectively.

Method: Uses frozen LLM with lightweight adapters to generate text-conditioned embeddings from titles/attributes/reviews, combined with LightGCN for collaborative embeddings. Aligns both views with symmetric contrastive objective and fuses via intra-layer gating to balance language and graph signals.

Result: Achieves best results on all eight metrics on Yelp and Amazon-Electronics datasets, with relative improvements up to +4.53% (Recall@40) and +4.01% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines language and graph signals, with language dominating in cold/long-tail scenarios and graph structure stabilizing rankings elsewhere. Ablations confirm the importance of cross-view alignment and gating fusion over alternatives.

Abstract: Personalization is a core capability across consumer technologies, streaming,
shopping, wearables, and voice, yet it remains challenged by sparse
interactions, fast content churn, and heterogeneous textual signals. We present
RecMind, an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that treats the language model as a
preference prior rather than a monolithic ranker. A frozen LLM equipped with
lightweight adapters produces text-conditioned user/item embeddings from
titles, attributes, and reviews; a LightGCN backbone learns collaborative
embeddings from the user-item graph. We align the two views with a symmetric
contrastive objective and fuse them via intra-layer gating, allowing language
to dominate in cold/long-tail regimes and graph structure to stabilize rankings
elsewhere. On Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, RecMind attains the best results on
all eight reported metrics, with relative improvements up to +4.53\%
(Recall@40) and +4.01\% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines. Ablations confirm both
the necessity of cross-view alignment and the advantage of gating over late
fusion and LLM-only variants.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for fast prediction of fault impact probabilities in sequential circuits, reducing simulation time by 10x while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Silent Data Errors from defects and aging degrade safety-critical systems, and functional testing to detect these faults is expensive to simulate.

Method: Model gate-level netlists as spatio-temporal graphs to capture topology and signal timing, using dedicated spatial and temporal encoders to predict multi-cycle fault impact probabilities efficiently.

Result: On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). Test-point selection using predicted FIPs improves detection of hard-to-detect faults.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient quantitative risk assessment, scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization, and fits well with electronic design automation flows.

Abstract: Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade
safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is
expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact
probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk
assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to
capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders
predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method
reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean
absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features
from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points
by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The
approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream
electronic design automation flows.

### [106] [LoaQ: Layer-wise Output Approximation Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06297)
*Li Lin,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoaQ is a layer-wise post-training quantization method that focuses on output-level consistency rather than local approximations, achieving better alignment with the original model outputs through a closed-form solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional layer-wise PTQ methods use local approximations that only achieve activation-aware weight approximations, leading to insufficient accuracy and deviations from the goal of matching original outputs. Recent improvements still fail to achieve full model output alignment.

Method: LoaQ is an output-approximation method that explicitly targets output-level consistency by leveraging structural characteristics of mainstream LLMs. It features a simple closed-form solution and is orthogonal to existing techniques.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen model families show LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and weight-activation joint quantization. It enhances overall quantization quality when integrated with existing strategies.

Conclusion: LoaQ advances post-training quantization by better aligning with the intuitive goal of matching original outputs, showing strong potential to push the frontier of quantization techniques through its simple integration and effectiveness.

Abstract: A natural and intuitive idea in model quantization is to approximate each
component's quantized output to match its original. Layer-wise post-training
quantization (PTQ), though based on this idea, adopts a strictly local view and
can achieve, at best, only activation-aware approximations of weights. As a
result, it often leads to insufficient approximations and practical deviations
from this guiding intuition. Recent work has achieved a more accurate
approximation of linear-layer outputs within the framework of layer-wise PTQ,
but such refinements remain inadequate for achieving alignment with the full
model output. Based on a deeper understanding of the structural characteristics
of mainstream LLMs, we propose $LoaQ$, an output-approximation method for
layer-wise PTQ that explicitly targets output-level consistency. It better
aligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution,
making it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into
existing quantization pipelines. Experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen model
families demonstrate that LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and
weight-activation joint quantization. By integrating seamlessly with existing
quantization strategies, it further enhances overall quantization quality and
shows strong potential to advance the frontier of post-training quantization.

*Hang Fan,Yu Shi,Zongliang Fu,Shuo Chen,Wei Wei,Wei Xu,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WindFM is a lightweight generative foundation model for probabilistic wind power forecasting that uses a discretize-and-generate framework with transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wind power forecasting methods either lack generalization across locations or cannot effectively incorporate domain-specific energy data, creating a need for specialized foundation models.

Method: Uses a discretize-and-generate framework with specialized time-series tokenizer to convert continuous multivariate observations into discrete hierarchical tokens, then trains decoder-only Transformer on 150 billion time steps from 126,000+ sites.

Result: The compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming specialized models and larger foundation models without fine-tuning, with strong adaptiveness to out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: WindFM demonstrates robust and transferable learned representations for wind power forecasting, offering a lightweight yet powerful foundation model that generalizes well across different geographical locations and conditions.

Abstract: High-quality wind power forecasting is crucial for the operation of modern
power grids. However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a
site-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on
fine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are
difficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper
introduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed
specifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a
discretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first
converts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical
tokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal
representation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on
these token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising
approximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM
develops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between
atmospheric conditions and power output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance on both deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming
specialized models and larger foundation models without any fine-tuning. In
particular, WindFM exhibits strong adaptiveness under out-of-distribution data
from a different continent, demonstrating the robustness and transferability of
its learned representations. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at

*Mehmet Can Yavuz,Berrin Yanikoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new redundancy index rho(C) that directly quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies in latent representations, providing a compact and statistically grounded measure of representational quality that predicts model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering generalization. Standard metrics like accuracy or reconstruction loss only provide indirect evidence of redundancy.

Method: Introduces a redundancy index rho(C) that analyzes coupling matrices derived from latent representations and compares their off-diagonal statistics against a normal distribution via energy distance.

Result: Low rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse. The measure works across discriminative and generative settings on multiple datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: rho(C) exposes redundancy as a universal bottleneck across models and tasks, offering both a theoretical lens and practical tool for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations, with applications in neural architecture search and regularization.

Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent
embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks
often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode
overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering
generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss
provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a
failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly
quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices
derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics
against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,
interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.
We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST
variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple
architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low
rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction
error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.
Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower
bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)
can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware
regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across
models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool
for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized PDE solutions without fine-tuning, showing predictive accuracy that improves with longer temporal contexts but degrades with finer spatial discretizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the emergent in-context learning capabilities of large language models for solving partial differential equations and understanding how they process numerical data without explicit training.

Method: Using text-trained foundation models to extrapolate PDE solutions through multi-step rollouts, analyzing token-level output distributions to understand the ICL progression patterns.

Result: LLMs accurately predict PDE dynamics with error growth following algebraic patterns similar to classical solvers, showing a consistent progression from pattern imitation to numerically grounded predictions.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate surprising capability in solving numerical PDE problems through in-context learning, revealing predictable scaling laws and consistent internal processing patterns for spatiotemporal data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent in-context learning
(ICL) capabilities across a range of tasks, including zero-shot time-series
forecasting. We show that text-trained foundation models can accurately
extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized partial differential
equation (PDE) solutions without fine-tuning or natural language prompting.
Predictive accuracy improves with longer temporal contexts but degrades at
finer spatial discretizations. In multi-step rollouts, where the model
recursively predicts future spatial states over multiple time steps, errors
grow algebraically with the time horizon, reminiscent of global error
accumulation in classical finite-difference solvers. We interpret these trends
as in-context neural scaling laws, where prediction quality varies predictably
with both context length and output length. To better understand how LLMs are
able to internally process PDE solutions so as to accurately roll them out, we
analyze token-level output distributions and uncover a consistent ICL
progression: beginning with syntactic pattern imitation, transitioning through
an exploratory high-entropy phase, and culminating in confident, numerically
grounded predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning with domain enrichment outperforms self-assessment in classifying meal logs against nutritional goals using free text data from low-income patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve nutrition guidance by automatically classifying patient-generated meal logs against specific nutritional goals using ML, addressing limitations of self-assessment.

Method: Used TFIDF and BERT text embeddings with domain enrichment (ontologies, ingredient parsers, macronutrient content) to train logistic regression and MLP classifiers on 3000+ meal records from 114 individuals.

Result: ML classifiers with enrichment achieved higher accuracy than self-assessments, with Parsed Ingredients, Food Entities, and Macronutrients enrichment performing best across multiple nutritional goals.

Conclusion: ML can reliably classify meal-goal alignment from free text logs, especially when incorporating nutrition domain knowledge, supporting precision healthcare nutrition guidance.

Abstract: This study examined the use of machine learning and domain specific
enrichment on patient generated health data, in the form of free text meal
logs, to classify meals on alignment with different nutritional goals. We used
a dataset of over 3000 meal records collected by 114 individuals from a
diverse, low income community in a major US city using a mobile app. Registered
dietitians provided expert judgement for meal to goal alignment, used as gold
standard for evaluation. Using text embeddings, including TFIDF and BERT, and
domain specific enrichment information, including ontologies, ingredient
parsers, and macronutrient contents as inputs, we evaluated the performance of
logistic regression and multilayer perceptron classifiers using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score against the gold standard and self assessment.
Even without enrichment, ML outperformed self assessments of individuals who
logged meals, and the best performing combination of ML classifier with
enrichment achieved even higher accuracies. In general, ML classifiers with
enrichment of Parsed Ingredients, Food Entities, and Macronutrients information
performed well across multiple nutritional goals, but there was variability in
the impact of enrichment and classification algorithm on accuracy of
classification for different nutritional goals. In conclusion, ML can utilize
unstructured free text meal logs and reliably classify whether meals align with
specific nutritional goals, exceeding self assessments, especially when
incorporating nutrition domain knowledge. Our findings highlight the potential
of ML analysis of patient generated health data to support patient centered
nutrition guidance in precision healthcare.

*Roussel Rahman,Aashwin Ananda Mishra*

TL;DR: LLMs excel at algorithmic math problems but fail at combinatorial puzzles requiring heuristic search, revealing their numerical reasoning is pattern-matching rather than true analytical thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the robustness of LLM numerical reasoning by testing performance across problems of escalating complexity, from basic arithmetic to combinatorial puzzles.

Method: Tested state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem challenge with four categories: basic arithmetic, advanced operations, primality checking, and Game of 24 number puzzle.

Result: High accuracy on first three categories requiring deterministic algorithmic execution, but consistent failure on the number puzzle requiring heuristic search over large combinatorial space.

Conclusion: LLMs' numerical proficiency is confined to recalling and executing known algorithms rather than generative problem-solving, limiting their potential for tasks requiring novel numerical insights.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent
capabilities, yet the robustness of their numerical reasoning remains an open
question. While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem
sets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In
this work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on
problems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial
puzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem
challenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced
operations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our
results show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three
categories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they
consistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a
heuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant
bottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents' proficiency is largely
confined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing
generative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is
more akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought,
limiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical
insights.

*Yuanteng Chen,Peisong Wang,Yuantian Shao,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ban&Pick is a post-training plug-and-play strategy that improves MoE-LLM performance by reinforcing key experts and pruning redundant ones, achieving accuracy gains and faster inference without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE routers converge prematurely and enforce balanced expert usage, limiting performance potential and introducing redundancy by activating fixed numbers of experts per token.

Method: Ban&Pick uses two components: Pick identifies and reinforces key influential experts, while Ban dynamically prunes redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity.

Result: On Qwen3-30B-A3B, improved accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from 65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, with 1.25x inference acceleration under vLLM.

Conclusion: The method delivers free performance gains and inference acceleration for fine-grained MoE-LLMs across math, code, and reasoning benchmarks without architectural changes.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling
large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs
introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per
token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers
are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely
and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance
and efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few
highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced
routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per
token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or
redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training,
plug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces
key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to
notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically
pruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering
faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained
MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that Ban&Pick delivers free performance gains and inference
acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on
Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from
65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the
vLLM.

TL;DR: Enhanced Variational Garrote (VG) method for sparse variable selection using statistical physics and variational inference, outperforms Ridge and LASSO in highly sparse regimes with automatic differentiation for scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for effective variable selection from high-dimensional data to promote model simplicity and explainability in the big data era.

Method: Revisits and enhances Variational Garrote with automatic differentiation, introducing feature selection spin variables and variational inference for tractable optimization.

Result: VG performs best in highly sparse settings, shows consistent variable selection, and reveals sharp transition point for estimating correct number of relevant variables.

Conclusion: VG has strong potential for sparse modeling applications including compressed sensing and machine learning model pruning, providing robust variable selection.

Abstract: Selecting key variables from high-dimensional data is increasingly important
in the era of big data. Sparse regression serves as a powerful tool for this
purpose by promoting model simplicity and explainability. In this work, we
revisit a valuable yet underutilized method, the statistical physics-based
Variational Garrote (VG), which introduces explicit feature selection spin
variables and leverages variational inference to derive a tractable loss
function. We enhance VG by incorporating modern automatic differentiation
techniques, enabling scalable and efficient optimization. We evaluate VG on
both fully controllable synthetic datasets and complex real-world datasets. Our
results demonstrate that VG performs especially well in highly sparse regimes,
offering more consistent and robust variable selection than Ridge and LASSO
regression across varying levels of sparsity. We also uncover a sharp
transition: as superfluous variables are admitted, generalization degrades
abruptly and the uncertainty of the selection variables increases. This
transition point provides a practical signal for estimating the correct number
of relevant variables, an insight we successfully apply to identify key
predictors in real-world data. We expect that VG offers strong potential for
sparse modeling across a wide range of applications, including compressed
sensing and model pruning in machine learning.

Motivation: Traditional financial risk management separates pre-service risk assessment and in-service default detection, missing opportunities to leverage in-service behavioral data for better pre-service predictions.

Method: Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation (MGKD) with teacher-student framework, using soft labels from in-service data, coarse/fine-grained distillation, self-distillation, and re-weighting for class imbalance.

Result: Experimental results on Tencent Mobile Payment datasets show effectiveness in both offline and online scenarios, improving pre-service risk assessment performance.

Conclusion: MGKD successfully bridges pre-service and in-service risk modeling, enabling transfer of default behavior patterns and improving risk prediction before service activation.

the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of
knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical
in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service
data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model
helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service
activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced,
including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the
representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This
approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also
enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from
the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of
pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to
mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on
large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios.

### [116] [Graph Neural Networks for Resource Allocation in Interference-limited Multi-Channel Wireless Networks with QoS Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06395)
*Lili Chen,Changyang She,Jingge Zhu,Jamie Evans*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel GNN-based framework with Lagrangian optimization that ensures QoS constraints and convergence guarantees for multi-channel wireless resource allocation, outperforming traditional deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning approaches for wireless resource allocation use heuristic penalty terms without theoretical convergence guarantees and often fail to meet QoS requirements in complex networks.

Method: Extended WMMSE to multi-channel with QoS constraints (eWMMSE), then developed JCPGNN-M - a GNN integrated with Lagrangian primal-dual optimization framework to ensure constraint satisfaction and convergence.

Result: JCPGNN-M matches eWMMSE performance while offering significant improvements in inference speed, generalization to larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained resource allocation in future wireless networks with guaranteed QoS satisfaction.

Abstract: Meeting minimum data rate constraints is a significant challenge in wireless
communication systems, particularly as network complexity grows. Traditional
deep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating
penalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically.
However, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees
and frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios.
Building upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a
multi-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE
(eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution
when the problem is feasible. To further reduce computational complexity and
improve scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of
supporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the
limitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled
framework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization
method. By training the GNN within the Lagrangian framework, we ensure
satisfaction of QoS constraints and convergence to a stationary point.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that JCPGNN-M matches the performance of
eWMMSE while offering significant gains in inference speed, generalization to
larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information. This
work presents a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained
resource allocation in future wireless networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroDeX is a novel decompiler for DNN executables that uses LLMs and dynamic analysis to handle compilation optimizations and quantized models, achieving high accuracy in recovering original models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device deep learning models face reverse engineering threats, and existing decompilers struggle with compilation optimizations and quantized compiled models.

Method: Leverages semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs combined with dynamic analysis to perform operator type recognition, attribute recovery, and model reconstruction.

Result: Successfully decompiles 96 DNN executables across 12 models, recovering non-quantized executables into nearly identical models and achieving 72% top-1 accuracy for quantized executables.

Conclusion: NeuroDeX provides a more comprehensive and effective solution for DNN executable decompilation compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: On-device deep learning models have extensive real world demands. Deep
learning compilers efficiently compile models into executables for deployment
on edge devices, but these executables may face the threat of reverse
engineering. Previous studies have attempted to decompile DNN executables, but
they face challenges in handling compilation optimizations and analyzing
quantized compiled models. In this paper, we present NeuroDeX to unlock diverse
support in decompiling DNN executables. NeuroDeX leverages the semantic
understanding capabilities of LLMs along with dynamic analysis to accurately
and efficiently perform operator type recognition, operator attribute recovery
and model reconstruction. NeuroDeX can recover DNN executables into high-level
models towards compilation optimizations, different architectures and quantized
compiled models. We conduct experiments on 96 DNN executables across 12 common
DNN models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that NeuroDeX can
decompile non-quantized executables into nearly identical high-level models.
NeuroDeX can recover functionally similar high-level models for quantized
executables, achieving an average top-1 accuracy of 72%. NeuroDeX offers a more
comprehensive and effective solution compared to previous DNN executables
decompilers.

### [118] [CAPMix: Robust Time Series Anomaly Detection Based on Abnormal Assumptions with Dual-Space Mixup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06419)
*Xudong Mou,Rui Wang,Tiejun Wang,Renyu Yang,Shiru Chen,Jie Sun,Tianyu Wo,Xudong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAPMix is a controllable anomaly augmentation framework for time series anomaly detection that addresses patchy generation and anomaly shift issues through CutAddPaste mechanism, label revision strategy, and dual-space mixup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly assumption approaches suffer from patchy generation (scattered anomaly knowledge leading to simplistic injections) and anomaly shift (synthetic anomalies either too similar to normal data or unrealistically divergent from real anomalies), which distort classification boundaries.

Method: Proposes CAPMix framework with: 1) CutAddPaste mechanism for targeted anomaly injection, 2) label revision strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, and 3) dual-space mixup within temporal convolutional network for smoother decision boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets (AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, ESA) show CAPMix achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines with enhanced robustness against contaminated training data.

Conclusion: CAPMix effectively addresses fundamental limitations of existing anomaly assumption methods and demonstrates superior performance in time series anomaly detection tasks with scarce labeled anomalies.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task,
particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal
dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate
the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training
discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer
from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly
knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and
Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too
closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting
classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable
anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a
CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted
manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision
strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly
shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional
network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and
ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated
training data. The code is available at https://github.com/alsike22/CAPMix.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAME-AB is a cross-modality attention framework with Mixture-of-Experts backbone that integrates five biological modalities for robust antibody binding site prediction, outperforming existing methods on multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing antibody binding site prediction methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific binding sites on antigens, suffering from dual limitations in representation and prediction.

Method: Integrates five biological modalities (amino acid encodings, BLOSUM profiles, language model embeddings, structure-aware features, GCN-refined graphs) with adaptive modality fusion, Transformer encoder, MoE module, supervised contrastive learning, and stochastic weight averaging.

Result: CAME-AB consistently outperforms strong baselines on benchmark datasets across multiple metrics including Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies validate each component's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal framework successfully addresses limitations of single-view methods and demonstrates superior performance in antibody binding site prediction through comprehensive feature integration and adaptive learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational
immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure
methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific
binding sites on the antigens-a dual limitation in representation and
prediction. In this paper, we propose CAME-AB, a novel Cross-modality Attention
framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding
site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities,
including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained
language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined
biochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance
adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module
that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance
and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE
module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We
additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to
explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and
generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive
experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB
consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including
Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of
multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes

*Guanjie Cheng,Boyi Li,Peihan Wu,Feiyi Chen,Xinkui Zhao,Mengying Zhu,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DyC-STG is a novel framework for IoT data credibility analysis that combines event-driven dynamic graphs with causal reasoning to overcome limitations of traditional spatio-temporal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spatio-temporal graph models fail in human-centric IoT environments due to static topologies that don't capture physical dynamics and confusion between spurious correlations and true causality, undermining data credibility.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (DyC-STG) with two key components: event-driven dynamic graph module that adapts topology in real-time, and causal reasoning module that enforces temporal precedence for causally-aware representations.

Result: DyC-STG establishes new state-of-the-art, outperforming strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving F1-Score up to 0.930. Two new real-world datasets released to facilitate research.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses critical limitations of existing STG models by integrating dynamic topology adaptation and causal reasoning, providing robust data credibility analysis for IoT applications in human-centric environments.

Abstract: The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast
spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet
unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal
graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short
in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1)
their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical,
event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations
with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To
address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network
(DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis
in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven
dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect
physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware
representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the
research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive
experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming
the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of
up to 0.930.

TL;DR: HANNA is a neural network model that integrates physical laws as hard constraints to predict excess Gibbs energy for multi-component mixtures from molecular structures, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures from molecular structures is a long-standing challenge in chemical engineering and chemistry for modeling thermodynamic properties of liquid mixtures.

Method: Integrates physical laws as hard constraints within a flexible neural network, trained end-to-end on experimental binary mixture data from Dortmund Data Bank. Uses novel surrogate solver for liquid-liquid equilibrium data and geometric projection for multi-component extrapolation.

Result: HANNA delivers excellent predictions, clearly outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark methods in both accuracy and scope.

Conclusion: The model successfully addresses the challenge of predicting excess Gibbs energy from molecular structures while ensuring thermodynamic consistency, with open availability of trained model and code.

Abstract: The excess Gibbs energy plays a central role in chemical engineering and
chemistry, providing a basis for modeling the thermodynamic properties of
liquid mixtures. Predicting the excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures
solely from the molecular structures of their components is a long-standing
challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating physical laws
as hard constraints within a flexible neural network. The resulting model,
HANNA, was trained end-to-end on an extensive experimental dataset for binary
mixtures from the Dortmund Data Bank, guaranteeing thermodynamically consistent
predictions. A novel surrogate solver developed in this work enabled the
inclusion of liquid-liquid equilibrium data in the training process.
Furthermore, a geometric projection method was applied to enable robust
extrapolations to multi-component mixtures, without requiring additional
parameters. We demonstrate that HANNA delivers excellent predictions, clearly
outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark methods in accuracy and scope. The
trained model and corresponding code are openly available, and an interactive

### [122] [On optimal solutions of classical and sliced Wasserstein GANs with non-Gaussian data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06505)
*Yu-Jui Huang,Hsin-Hua Shen,Yu-Chih Huang,Wan-Yi Lin,Shih-Chun Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops closed-form optimal parameters for Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) beyond the linear-quadratic-Gaussian setting, extending to non-linear activations and non-Gaussian data in 1D, and shows linear generators can be asymptotically optimal for sliced WGANs in high dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN parameter selection typically requires exhaustive search with few theoretically optimal methods. Prior optimal parameter work for WGANs was limited to linear networks and Gaussian data (LQG setting), leaving non-linear and non-Gaussian cases unexplored.

Method: Derived closed-form optimal parameters for 1D WGANs with non-linear activations and non-Gaussian data. Extended to high dimensions using sliced Wasserstein framework, replacing marginal constraints on projected data with joint distribution constraints on original data.

Result: Empirical studies show good convergence behavior with both Gaussian and Laplace distributions. The proposed sliced WGAN solution achieves same performance as r-PCA but with less computational resources.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretically grounded optimal parameter solutions for WGANs beyond traditional LQG limitations, demonstrating practical efficiency and performance improvements for non-linear networks and non-Gaussian data distributions.

Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown
distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been
widely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer
vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and
only a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of
the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on
optimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)
setting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we
focus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG
setting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs
when the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian.
To extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein
framework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly
projected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original
(unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically
optimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our
closed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both
Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component
analysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve
the same performance while requiring less computational resources.

### [123] [QualityFM: a Multimodal Physiological Signal Foundation Model with Self-Distillation for Signal Quality Challenges in Critically Ill Patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06516)
*Zongheng Guo,Tao Chen,Manuela Ferrario*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QualityFM is a multimodal foundation model for PPG and ECG signals that uses self-distillation and windowed sparse attention to improve signal quality assessment and clinical task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG and ECG signals in ICU/OR often have poor quality leading to false alarms and diagnostic errors. Existing methods lack generalizability, require extensive labeled data, and have poor cross-task transferability.

Method: Dual-track architecture with self-distillation (high-quality encoder guides low-quality encoder), windowed sparse attention for long sequences, composite loss function with distillation and reconstruction losses on power/phase spectra. Pre-trained on 21M+ waveforms (179,757 hours).

Result: Three models with 9.6M to 319M parameters were pre-trained and showed efficacy in transfer learning for ventricular tachycardia false alarm detection, atrial fibrillation identification, and ABP estimation from PPG/ECG.

Conclusion: QualityFM provides a general-purpose foundation model for physiological signal quality assessment that overcomes limitations of previous methods and demonstrates strong performance across multiple clinical applications.

Abstract: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in
intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence
of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms
or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited
generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task
transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel
multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to
acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is
pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second
waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track
architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality,
leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality
signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To
efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local
quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism
within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function,
which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect
reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation
of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models
with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy
and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks:
false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial
fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and
ECG signals.

*Francesco De Cristofaro,Cornelia Lex,Jia Hu,Arno Eichberger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer model for lane change prediction suffers from poor cross-dataset generalization (39.43% accuracy) but achieves high accuracy (86.71%) when trained on combined datasets from Germany and Hong Kong.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lane change intention prediction algorithms are typically trained and tested on single datasets, lacking validation of their effectiveness across different populations and driving environments.

Method: Tested a transformer-based model for lane change intention prediction on two distinct datasets collected by LevelX in Germany and Hong Kong, evaluating both cross-dataset performance and combined training approach.

Result: The transformer's accuracy dropped significantly to 39.43% when tested on a different population than it was trained on, but achieved 86.71% accuracy when trained on both datasets simultaneously.

Conclusion: Lane change prediction models exhibit poor generalization across different geographic populations, but combining diverse training data from multiple regions significantly improves model performance and robustness.

Abstract: As a result of the growing importance of lane change intention prediction for
a safe and efficient driving experience in complex driving scenarios,
researchers have in recent years started to train novel machine learning
algorithms on available datasets with promising results. A shortcoming of this
recent research effort, though, is that the vast majority of the proposed
algorithms are trained on a single datasets. In doing so, researchers failed to
test if their algorithm would be as effective if tested on a different dataset
and, by extension, on a different population with respect to the one on which
they were trained. In this article we test a transformer designed for lane
change intention prediction on two datasets collected by LevelX in Germany and
Hong Kong. We found that the transformer's accuracy plummeted when tested on a
population different to the one it was trained on with accuracy values as low
as 39.43%, but that when trained on both populations simultaneously it could
achieve an accuracy as high as 86.71%. - This work has been submitted to the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes BF-PPO, a PPO-based method with particle filter for optimal defender strategy in CAGE-2 cybersecurity benchmark, outperforming state-of-the-art CARDIFF in both performance and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAGE-2 is a standard benchmark for cybersecurity defense strategies, but existing methods lack formal modeling and optimal strategy definition. The paper aims to provide a formal POMDP framework and efficient learning method for optimal defense.

Method: Constructs formal CAGE-2 model using POMDP framework, defines optimal defender strategy, and introduces BF-PPO method based on PPO with particle filter to handle large state space complexity.

Result: BF-PPO outperforms CARDIFF (highest ranked method on CAGE-2 leaderboard) in both learned defender strategy quality and required training time.

Conclusion: The POMDP-based formal modeling and BF-PPO method with particle filtering provide an effective approach for learning optimal cybersecurity defense strategies, demonstrating superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: CAGE-2 is an accepted benchmark for learning and evaluating defender
strategies against cyberattacks. It reflects a scenario where a defender agent
protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods
for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a
formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender
strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy.
Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to
mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the
CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and
compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the
CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the
learned defender strategy and the required training time.

*John Tolladay,Beth Albert,Gabriel Davis Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Supervised VAE model for CTG signal classification achieves competitive fetal outcome prediction (AUROC 0.752-0.779) while partially encoding clinically meaningful features, though full interpretability remains challenging due to FHR signal complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address interpretability limitations of current deep learning approaches for cardiotocography (CTG) signal classification by developing a supervised variational autoencoder that can both classify pregnancy outcomes and provide insights into clinically relevant features.

Method: Used OxMat CTG dataset with five-minute fetal heart rate segments labeled with postnatal outcomes. Trained VAE optimized for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction, incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation constraints to structure latent space. Evaluated performance with AUROC and MSE, and interpretability with coefficient of determination, latent traversals, and unsupervised component analyses.

Result: Model achieved AUROC of 0.752 at segment level and 0.779 at CTG level. Relaxing total correlation constraints improved both reconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed baseline-related features (FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned with model scores, while short- and long-term variability metrics were less strongly encoded.

Conclusion: Supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while partially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features, though the irregular, multi-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for full interpretability. The model provides a foundation for future interpretable generative models in CTG analysis.

Abstract: Objective: To develop and interpret a supervised variational autoencoder
(VAE) model for classifying cardiotocography (CTG) signals based on pregnancy
outcomes, addressing interpretability limits of current deep learning
approaches. Methods: The OxMat CTG dataset was used to train a VAE on
five-minute fetal heart rate (FHR) segments, labeled with postnatal outcomes.
The model was optimised for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction,
incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation (TC)
constraints to structure the latent space. Performance was evaluated using area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean squared
error (MSE). Interpretability was assessed using coefficient of determination,
latent traversals and unsupervised component analyses. Results: The model
achieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level,
where predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both
reconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related
features (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned
with model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were
less strongly encoded. Traversals revealed clear signal changes for baseline
features, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised
decompositions corroborated these patterns. Findings: This work demonstrates
that supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while
partially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features. The irregular,
multi-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for disentangling
physiological components, distinguishing CTG from more periodic signals such as
ECG. Although full interpretability was not achieved, the model supports
clinically useful outcome prediction and provides a basis for future
interpretable, generative models.

*Jack Wilkie,Hanan Hindy,Christos Tachtatzis,Robert Atkinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLAN introduces a novel contrastive learning approach for network intrusion detection that treats augmented samples as negative views (malicious) while using other benign samples as positive views, improving both accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised ML requires large labeled datasets, while anomaly detection methods suffer from high false positive rates. Self-supervised learning shows promise but existing approaches use data augmentation for positive views and treat other samples as negative.

Method: Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative pairs (CLAN) - treats augmented samples as negative views (representing malicious distributions) while using other benign samples as positive views during pretraining on benign traffic.

Result: Outperforms existing self-supervised and anomaly detection techniques in binary classification on Lycos2017 dataset. Achieves superior multi-class classification performance when fine-tuned on limited labeled data.

Conclusion: CLAN provides an effective self-supervised learning paradigm for network intrusion detection that enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency, making it practical for real-world applications with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity.
While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance,
their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many
real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on
benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive
rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques
have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by
learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In
particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the
distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it
between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive
views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In
contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative
pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented
samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious
distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This
approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after
pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and
anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when
fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves
superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing
self-supervised models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device real-time data distribution shifts challenge lightweight model generalization, and current data-intensive fine-tuning approaches are computationally expensive and impractical for post-deployment scenarios.

Method: Uses a neural adapter in the cloud to generate parameter editing matrices from real-time device data, clustering models into prototypes that are dynamically refined through backpropagation-free parameter editing with cross-layer knowledge transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments on vision and recommendation tasks across multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and generality in adapting to data distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Persona provides an efficient framework for enhancing on-device model generalization without post-deployment retraining, addressing critical real-time data shift challenges through prototype-based parameter editing.

Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the
generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often
overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive
and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we
introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,
backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model
generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural
adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time
device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data
distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The
prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,
facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer
knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter
changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and
recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and
generality.

### [129] [AI for Scientific Discovery is a Social Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06580)
*Georgia Channing,Avijit Ghosh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that the main barriers to AI's impact on scientific discovery are social and institutional rather than technical, highlighting four key challenges that require community-building and equitable infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address why AI benefits remain unevenly distributed in scientific discovery despite technical advances, focusing on social and institutional barriers rather than purely technical obstacles.

Method: The paper analyzes and identifies four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, misaligned research priorities, data fragmentation, and infrastructure inequities, arguing these stem from cultural and organizational practices.

Result: The analysis reveals that technical innovation alone is insufficient, and that addressing these barriers requires intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure.

Conclusion: AI for science should be reframed as a collective social project where sustainable collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for technical progress, rather than focusing solely on speculative "AI scientists".

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet its
benefits remain unevenly distributed. While technical obstacles such as scarce
data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computation are significant,
we argue that the primary barriers are social and institutional. Narratives
that defer progress to speculative "AI scientists," the undervaluing of data
and infrastructure contributions, misaligned incentives, and gaps between
domain experts and machine learning researchers all constrain impact. We
highlight four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, research
priorities misaligned with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and
infrastructure inequities. We argue that their roots lie in cultural and
organizational practices. Addressing them requires not only technical
innovation but also intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary
education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for
reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable
collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for
technical progress.

### [130] [Information-Theoretic Bounds and Task-Centric Learning Complexity for Real-World Dynamic Nonlinear Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06599)
*Sri Satish Krishna Chaitanya Bulusu,Mikko Sillanpää*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical framework for modeling dynamic nonlinear systems using structured decomposition, variance analysis, and complexity bounds, showing static and dynamic distortions cannot be minimized simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit coupled static and dynamic distortions that pose major challenges for data-driven modeling, requiring a more foundational theoretical approach.

Method: Uses structured decomposition, variance analysis, directional lower bounds on interactions, behavioral indicators, memory finiteness index, and power-based conditions linking to thermodynamics.

Result: Develops a Behavioral Uncertainty Principle showing static/dynamic trade-off, proves systems resist complete decomposition, establishes variance-complexity theorems, and explains empirical benefits of structured residual learning.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, theoretically grounded framework for modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems with broad applicability and explains improved generalization, reduced parameters, and lower training costs.

Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and
dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for
data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in
structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity
bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between
measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces
to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities
for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a
memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a
measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law
of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical
bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty
Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be
minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist
complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic
effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance
to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a
model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance
components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual
learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower
training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization
experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable,
theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI system (HAO) automates patient summary generation for Molecular Tumor Boards using LLM agents, with TBFact framework for evaluation, achieving 94% high-importance information capture and enabling secure local deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual patient summary creation for MTBs is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to information omissions, requiring automated solutions.

Method: Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO) coordinates multi-agent clinical workflow using LLMs; TBFact framework uses model-as-judge approach to evaluate summary comprehensiveness and succinctness.

Result: HAO captured 94% of high-importance information with 0.84 TBFact recall under strict criteria; TBFact enables data-free evaluation without sharing sensitive clinical data.

Conclusion: HAO and TBFact provide reliable, scalable support for MTBs through automated patient summary generation and robust evaluation framework.

Abstract: Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology
specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal
treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary,
typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon,
or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records
into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is
often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical
information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent
Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that
coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and
comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient
summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic
variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate
the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these
evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework
designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated
summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board
discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results
show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including
partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict
entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free
evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing
sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation
for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of GCNs for inductive node classification in dynamic graphs, deriving generalization bounds that account for data dependency and non-stationarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graphs are dynamic with evolving nodes and connections, but previous theoretical studies based on transductive learning fail to adequately model temporal evolution and structural dynamics.

Method: PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of one-layer and two-layer graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent and non-identically distributed data points.

Result: Derived novel generalization bounds that incorporate data dependency and non-stationarity effects, established sufficient conditions for generalization gap convergence to zero with increasing nodes, and revealed that two-layer GCNs require stronger graph topology assumptions.

Conclusion: This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing
graph-structured data across various applications. A critical aspect of
real-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually
added and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical
studies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to
adequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this
paper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent
and non-identically distributed data points. We derive novel generalization
bounds for one-layer GCNs that explicitly incorporate the effects of data
dependency and non-stationarity, and establish sufficient conditions under
which the generalization gap converges to zero as the number of nodes
increases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two-layer GCNs, and reveal
that it requires stronger assumptions on graph topology to guarantee
convergence. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding
and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.

*Chen Xie,Gaofeng Wu,Kaidong Wang,Zihao Zhu,Xiaoshu Luo,Yan Liang,Feiyu Quan,Ruoxi Wu,Xianghui Huang,Han Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BEAM is a novel deep learning framework that uses multi-view EEG signals to objectively predict empathy levels in young children (4-6 years), outperforming traditional methods by capturing both cognitive and emotional dimensions through spatio-temporal feature extraction and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional empathy assessment methods rely on subjective self-reports or observer labeling, which are biased and fail to objectively capture empathy formation processes. EEG offers objectivity but current approaches only extract static patterns, missing temporal dynamics.

Method: Proposed Brainwave Empathy Assessment Model (BEAM) with three components: 1) LaBraM-based encoder for spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) feature fusion module to integrate multi-view EEG signals, and 3) contrastive learning module to enhance class separation.

Result: BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics when validated on the CBCP dataset, demonstrating superior performance in empathy level prediction.

Conclusion: BEAM provides an objective tool for empathy assessment in young children and offers preliminary insights for early interventions in children's prosocial development.

Abstract: Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional
development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often
only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to
bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG
offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract
static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment
Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM
leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional
dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a
LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a
feature fusion module to integrate complementary information from multi-view
signals, and 3) a contrastive learning module to enhance class separation.
Validated on the CBCP dataset, BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
multiple metrics, demonstrating its potential for objective empathy assessment
and providing a preliminary insight into early interventions in children's
prosocial development.

*Xiaolu Fu,Ziyuan Bao,Eiman Kanjo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajAware is an RL-based routing framework for VANETs that addresses dynamic topologies and edge device constraints through action space pruning, graph cross-attention, and trajectory-aware prediction, achieving near-optimal performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VANETs face routing challenges due to dynamic topologies, incomplete observations, and limited edge device resources. Existing RL approaches assume fixed structures and require retraining, making them unsuitable for constrained hardware deployment.

Method: Three-component framework: (1) action space pruning to reduce neighbor options while maintaining two-hop reachability, (2) graph cross-attention to map pruned neighbors to global context for generalization, (3) trajectory-aware prediction using historical routes and junction info for real-time position estimation under partial observations.

Result: Evaluated in SUMO simulator with real-world city maps using leave-one-city-out setup. Achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.

Conclusion: TrajAware provides an effective RL-based solution for VANET routing that addresses the limitations of existing approaches, offering generalization across network sizes and efficient deployment on resource-constrained edge hardware.

Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a crucial component of intelligent
transportation systems; however, routing remains challenging due to dynamic
topologies, incomplete observations, and the limited resources of edge devices.
Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph
structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them
unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an
RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware
integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant
neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse
of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to
the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse
network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical
routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial
observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using
real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that
TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while
maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lightweight steering vectors trained with RL can match fine-tuning performance while remaining interpretable. Analysis shows last-layer vectors act as token-substitution biases on first tokens, while penultimate-layer vectors work through MLP/unembedding to up-weight process words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reasoning training reshapes language model computations, particularly through lightweight steering vectors that offer interpretability while maintaining performance.

Method: Used reinforcement-learning trained steering vectors inserted into residual stream, analyzed with logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses on two models.

Result: Found last-layer vectors behave like token-substitution biases concentrated on first generated tokens, while penultimate-layer vectors act through MLP/unembedding to preferentially up-weight process words and structure symbols.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled framework for interpreting behavioral changes induced by reasoning training using lightweight, interpretable steering vectors.

Abstract: The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes language-model
computations remain poorly understood. We study lightweight steering vectors
inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a
reinforcement-learning objective, which can match full fine-tuning performance
while retaining the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using
logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses, we analyze two models
and find: (i) the last-layer steering vector behaves like a token-substitution
bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens
such as "To" and "Step"; and (ii) the penultimate-layer steering vector leaves
attention patterns largely unchanged and instead acts through the MLP and
unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols.
These results establish a principled framework for interpreting the behavioral
changes induced by reasoning training.

*Victor Toscano-Duran,Rocio Gonzalez-Diaz,Miguel A. Gutiérrez-Naranjo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Barycentric Neural Network (BNN) - a small shallow network using barycentric coordinates for exact representation of continuous piecewise linear functions, combined with new length-weighted persistent entropy loss for superior approximation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational costs of deep/overparameterized networks by creating small shallow networks that can exactly represent continuous piecewise linear functions and provide flexible approximations in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Uses fixed base points and barycentric coordinates to define BNN structure, introduces length-weighted persistent entropy (LWPE) as stable topological feature, and optimizes base points directly rather than internal weights.

Result: Achieves superior and faster approximation performance compared to classical loss functions (MSE, RMSE, MAE, log-cosh) in resource-constrained settings with limited base points and training epochs.

Conclusion: BNN combined with LWPE loss provides flexible, interpretable, and computationally efficient function approximation, enabling exact representation of continuous piecewise linear functions with strict continuity.

Abstract: While it is well-established that artificial neural networks are
\emph{universal approximators} for continuous functions on compact domains,
many modern approaches rely on deep or overparameterized architectures that
incur high computational costs. In this paper, a new type of \emph{small
shallow} neural network, called the \emph{Barycentric Neural Network} ($\BNN$),
is proposed, which leverages a fixed set of \emph{base points} and their
\emph{barycentric coordinates} to define both its structure and its parameters.
We demonstrate that our $\BNN$ enables the exact representation of
\emph{continuous piecewise linear functions} ($\CPLF$s), ensuring strict
continuity across segments. Since any continuous function over a compact domain
can be approximated arbitrarily well by $\CPLF$s, the $\BNN$ naturally emerges
as a flexible and interpretable tool for \emph{function approximation}. Beyond
the use of this representation, the main contribution of the paper is the
introduction of a new variant of \emph{persistent entropy}, a topological
feature that is stable and scale invariant, called the \emph{length-weighted
persistent entropy} ($\LWPE$), which is weighted by the lifetime of topological
features. Our framework, which combines the $\BNN$ with a loss function based
on our $\LWPE$, aims to provide flexible and geometrically interpretable
approximations of nonlinear continuous functions in resource-constrained
settings, such as those with limited base points for $\BNN$ design and few
training epochs. Instead of optimizing internal weights, our approach directly
\emph{optimizes the base points that define the $\BNN$}. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves \emph{superior and faster approximation
performance} compared to classical loss functions such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and
log-cosh.

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review of generalization in graph anomaly detection (GAD), addressing limitations of traditional methods that assume identical training/testing distributions and lack adaptability to real-world scenarios with shifting data distributions and scarce training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios with shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic review by tracing the evolution of generalization in GAD, formalizing problem settings, developing a systematic taxonomy, and providing an up-to-date comprehensive review of existing generalized GAD methods.

Result: The paper establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding generalization in GAD through systematic taxonomy and review of current methods.

Conclusion: The authors identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire research in generalization for graph anomaly detection, highlighting it as an emerging field with significant potential.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted increasing attention in recent
years for identifying malicious samples in a wide range of graph-based
applications, such as social media and e-commerce. However, most GAD methods
assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to
specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such
as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications.
To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the
generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that
leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or
developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple
applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is
still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of
generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD
and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic
taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive
review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we
identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire
future research in this emerging field.

TL;DR: A probabilistic theory of intelligent agency showing that weighted logarithmic pooling enables strict welfare improvement for all agents, with applications to LLM alignment phenomena like the Luigi/Waluigi effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a principled mathematical framework for understanding how subagents coalesce into coherent higher-level entities, with applications to AI alignment in neural models and agentic systems.

Method: Represent agents as outcome distributions with epistemic utility measured by log score. Define compositions through weighted logarithmic pooling. Prove theoretical results about unanimity and analyze properties like cloning invariance, continuity, and openness.

Result: Strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or binary outcomes but possible with three+ outcomes. Framework reveals agentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs where benevolent personas induce antagonistic counterparts, and manifest-then-suppress strategies yield better misalignment reduction.

Conclusion: The theory provides novel implications for alignment in agentic AI systems by formalizing how subagents can form coherent entities, with practical applications to understanding and mitigating alignment issues in large language models.

Abstract: We develop a theory of intelligent agency grounded in probabilistic modeling
for neural models. Agents are represented as outcome distributions with
epistemic utility given by log score, and compositions are defined through
weighted logarithmic pooling that strictly improves every member's welfare. We
prove that strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or in binary
outcome spaces, but possible with three or more outcomes. Our framework admits
recursive structure via cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, while
tilt-based analysis rules out trivial duplication. Finally, we formalize an
agentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs using our theory: eliciting a benevolent
persona ("Luigi'") induces an antagonistic counterpart ("Waluigi"), while a
manifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields strictly larger first-order
misalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone. These results
clarify how developing a principled mathematical framework for how subagents
can coalesce into coherent higher-level entities provides novel implications
for alignment in agentic AI systems.

TL;DR: LR-GWN is a novel graph neural network that combines local polynomial approximations with spectral parameterization to effectively capture both short-range and long-range interactions in graphs, outperforming existing wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wavelet-based graph neural networks are limited by finite-order polynomial approximations that restrict their receptive fields and hinder long-range information propagation across graphs.

Method: Decomposes wavelet filters into complementary local and global components: local aggregation uses efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through flexible spectral domain parameterization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid design successfully unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework, addressing the central challenge of modeling long-range interactions in graph machine learning.

Abstract: Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across
distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning.
Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a
principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing
wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial
approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range
propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which
decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local
aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range
interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization.
This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a
principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves
state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range
benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

TL;DR: A simple algorithm that learns local routing policies from few samples on a single graph, generalizing to geometric random graphs. Uses DNNs for efficient packet forwarding with domain knowledge integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the all-pairs near-shortest path problem efficiently by learning generalizable routing policies that work across various geometric random graphs with minimal training data.

Method: Train deep neural networks using domain knowledge for feature selection and policy design. Input features include distance-to-destination and node stretch. Uses single graph sampling for generalizable learning.

Result: Learned a policy matching Greedy Forwarding when using only distance-to-destination, and developed GreedyTensile routing (using both features) that outperforms greedy forwarding. Achieved explainable, ultra-low latency operation through symbolic interpretation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully learns efficient and generalizable routing policies with minimal data, demonstrating both replication of known optimal policies and development of new superior routing strategies with explainable DNN interpretations.

Abstract: We propose a simple algorithm that needs only a few data samples from a
single graph for learning local routing policies that generalize across a rich
class of geometric random graphs in Euclidean metric spaces. We thus solve the
all-pairs near-shortest path problem by training deep neural networks (DNNs)
that let each graph node efficiently and scalably route (i.e., forward) packets
by considering only the node's state and the state of the neighboring nodes.
Our algorithm design exploits network domain knowledge in the selection of
input features and design of the policy function for learning an approximately
optimal policy. Domain knowledge also provides theoretical assurance that the
choice of a ``seed graph'' and its node data sampling suffices for
generalizable learning. Remarkably, one of these DNNs we train -- using
distance-to-destination as the only input feature -- learns a policy that
exactly matches the well-known Greedy Forwarding policy, which forwards packets
to the neighbor with the shortest distance to the destination. We also learn a
new policy, which we call GreedyTensile routing -- using both
distance-to-destination and node stretch as the input features -- that almost
always outperforms greedy forwarding. We demonstrate the explainability and
ultra-low latency run-time operation of Greedy Tensile routing by symbolically
interpreting its DNN in low-complexity terms of two linear actions.

Motivation: Fine-tuning LVLMs for human alignment and specific tasks remains challenging despite pretraining progress

Method: Explores Deep Reinforcement Learning (using reward signals) and Direct Preference Optimization (direct policy alignment) frameworks

Result: Categorizes approaches, examines preference data sources and reward signals, identifies challenges like scalability and safety

Conclusion: DRL and DPO contribute significantly to developing robust, human-aligned multimodal models

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or multimodal large language models
represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling
systems to understand and generate content across both visual and textual
modalities. While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress,
fine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific
tasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for
this aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using
reward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO
directly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an
explicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs,
highlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human
preferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive
multimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of
preference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as
scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.
The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to
the evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.

TL;DR: Proposes gcGAIL model for individual travel behavior modeling using group effects and generative adversarial imitation learning, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individual travel behavior modeling is crucial for urban mobility regulation but faces data challenges with MDP approaches - limited data quantity, spatial-temporal coverage, and situational diversity.

Method: Group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) that leverages shared behavioral patterns among passenger groups to improve modeling efficiency.

Result: gcGAIL outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks (AIRL, GAIL, conditional GAIL) in accuracy, generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Robust to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity.

Conclusion: gcGAIL enables effective prediction of individual behavior responses over time, providing basis for personalized incentives and sustainable behavior changes in urban mobility.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling individual travel behavior responses is crucial
for urban mobility regulation and policy evaluation. The Markov decision
process (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior
modeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is
highly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal
coverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a
group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model
that improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared
behavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using
a public transport fare-discount case study and compare against
state-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results
demonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel
behavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust
to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining
strong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented
passenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at
any time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable

*Bhavya Agrawalla,Michal Nauman,Khush Agarwal,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Floq introduces iterative computation to TD-learning by parameterizing Q-functions as velocity fields trained with flow-matching techniques, enabling better capacity scaling and performance improvements in RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern ML uses dense supervision for intermediate computations (like teacher forcing in language models), which enables learning complex functions. This motivates applying iterative computation to temporal difference methods in RL, which typically use monolithic value function representations.

Method: Parameterizes Q-function using a velocity field and trains it with flow-matching techniques from generative modeling. The velocity field is trained with TD-learning objective that bootstraps from values produced by a target velocity field through multiple steps of numerical integration.

Result: Across challenging offline RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly 1.8x and scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures.

Conclusion: Floq demonstrates the potential of iterative computation for value learning in RL, providing more fine-grained control and better scaling of Q-function capacity through appropriate setting of integration steps.

Abstract: A hallmark of modern large-scale machine learning techniques is the use of
training objectives that provide dense supervision to intermediate
computations, such as teacher forcing the next token in language models or
denoising step-by-step in diffusion models. This enables models to learn
complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we
investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD)
methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value
functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq
(flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function
using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching,
typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow
is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced
by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical
integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling
of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately
setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline
RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly
1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures,
highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.

*Sukumar Kishanthan,Asela Hevapathige*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AxelSMOTE is a novel agent-based oversampling method that addresses class imbalance by modeling data instances as autonomous agents using Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional oversampling methods have limitations: they treat features independently, lack similarity controls, limit diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively in imbalanced datasets.

Method: AxelSMOTE uses agent-based modeling with four innovations: trait-based feature grouping, similarity-based probabilistic exchange, Beta distribution blending, and controlled diversity injection to generate realistic synthetic samples.

Result: Experiments on eight imbalanced datasets show that AxelSMOTE outperforms state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: AxelSMOTE successfully overcomes the drawbacks of traditional oversampling techniques by leveraging agent-based interactions and cultural dissemination principles, providing superior performance in handling class imbalance.

Abstract: Class imbalance in machine learning poses a significant challenge, as skewed
datasets often hinder performance on minority classes. Traditional oversampling
techniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several
drawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls,
limit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To
overcome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based
approach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex
interactions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE
implements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve
correlations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for
meaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic
interpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.
Experiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms
state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Tarhib Al Azad,Shahana Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a robust OOD detection framework that integrates loss correction techniques with low-rank and sparse decomposition to handle noisy training labels, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise significantly degrades out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance, but existing methods fail to address this challenge effectively. Current approaches combining noise-robust methods with OOD detection are insufficient.

Method: Integrates loss correction techniques from noisy label learning with low-rank and sparse decomposition methods from signal processing to create a robust OOD detection framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection techniques, especially under severe noisy label conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the critical challenge of robust OOD detection under noisy training labels, providing an effective solution that combines techniques from different domains.

Abstract: Robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable component of
modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, especially in safety-critical
applications where models must identify inputs from unfamiliar classes not seen
during training. While OOD detection has been extensively studied in the
machine learning literature--with both post hoc and training-based
approaches--its effectiveness under noisy training labels remains
underexplored. Recent studies suggest that label noise can significantly
degrade OOD performance, yet principled solutions to this issue are lacking. In
this work, we demonstrate that directly combining existing label noise-robust
methods with OOD detection strategies is insufficient to address this critical
challenge. To overcome this, we propose a robust OOD detection framework that
integrates loss correction techniques from the noisy label learning literature
with low-rank and sparse decomposition methods from signal processing.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art OOD detection
techniques, particularly under severe noisy label settings.

*Praneet Suresh,Jack Stanley,Sonia Joseph,Luca Scimeca,Danilo Bzdok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer models hallucinate when input uncertainty increases, activating input-insensitive semantic features that lead to coherent but incorrect outputs, with hallucinations predictable from internal concept patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how and when hallucinations arise in transformer models as generative AI systems become more prevalent in high-stakes applications, where their occasional volatility impedes trust and adoption.

Method: Used sparse autoencoders to capture concept representations in pre-trained transformer models under experimentally controlled input uncertainty scenarios, including pure-noise inputs, and conducted targeted steering to confirm functional integrity.

Result: Found that the number of semantic concepts grows as input becomes more unstructured, with transformers prone to activate coherent but input-insensitive features leading to hallucinations. Identified meaningful concepts triggered by pure noise and showed hallucinations can be reliably predicted from internal concept patterns.

Conclusion: Provides insights into transformer internal processing mechanics with immediate implications for AI alignment, safety, adversarial attack surfaces, and automatic quantification of hallucination risk.

Abstract: As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science,
business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an
acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity
of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI
solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when
hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept
representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with
experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic
experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer
model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the
face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes
prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to
hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide
variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate
activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we
confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the
output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept
patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights
on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for
aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for
potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic
quantification of a model's hallucination risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of consensus metrics for evaluating deep generative models in financial time series simulation, which is crucial for stress testing and decision-making under uncertainty.

Method: Uses nested optimal transport distance (time-causal variant of optimal transport) that is robust to financial decision tasks like hedging and optimal stopping. Also develops a statistically consistent, parallelizable computation algorithm.

Result: Achieves substantial speedups over existing approaches for computing the proposed evaluation metric.

Conclusion: The nested optimal transport distance provides a robust evaluation framework for financial time series generative models, with practical computational efficiency for real-world applications.

Abstract: Simulating realistic financial time series is essential for stress testing,
scenario generation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Despite advances in
deep generative models, there is no consensus metric for their evaluation. We
focus on generative AI for financial time series in decision-making
applications and employ the nested optimal transport distance, a time-causal
variant of optimal transport distance, which is robust to tasks such as
hedging, optimal stopping, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
statistically consistent, naturally parallelizable algorithm for its
computation, achieving substantial speedups over existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RT-HCP algorithm addresses slow inference in model-based RL for robot control by providing action sequences to maintain control frequency, offering superior sample efficiency and performance trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-based RL methods are sample efficient but suffer from slow inference times that prevent meeting robot control frequency requirements, creating a need for solutions that maintain both efficiency and real-time performance.

Method: Proposed a general framework for handling inference delays where slow controllers provide action sequences to feed control-hungry robotic platforms without execution gaps. Developed RT-HCP algorithm that optimizes the trade-off between performance, sample efficiency and inference time.

Result: RT-HCP demonstrated superior performance in experiments learning controllers directly on a high-frequency FURUTA pendulum platform, successfully addressing both sample efficiency and inference time challenges.

Conclusion: RT-HCP provides an excellent solution for real-time robot control by effectively managing inference delays while maintaining sample efficiency, making it suitable for learning controllers directly on robotic platforms with high frequency requirements.

Abstract: Learning a controller directly on the robot requires extreme sample
efficiency. Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the most sample
efficient, but they often suffer from a too long inference time to meet the
robot control frequency requirements. In this paper, we address the sample
efficiency and inference time challenges with two contributions. First, we
define a general framework to deal with inference delays where the slow
inference robot controller provides a sequence of actions to feed the
control-hungry robotic platform without execution gaps. Then, we compare
several RL algorithms in the light of this framework and propose RT-HCP, an
algorithm that offers an excellent trade-off between performance, sample
efficiency and inference time. We validate the superiority of RT-HCP with
experiments where we learn a controller directly on a simple but high frequency
FURUTA pendulum platform. Code: github.com/elasriz/RTHCP

### [149] [Asynchronous Message Passing for Addressing Oversquashing in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06777)
*Kushal Bose,Swagatam Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed asynchronous GNN framework with node centrality-based batching to address oversquashing in long-range tasks, achieving 5% and 4% improvements on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer from oversquashing in long-range interactions due to bottlenecks in message propagation. Graph rewiring methods compromise inductive bias and increase complexity.

Method: Asynchronous node feature updates using centrality-based batching, processing information sequentially across layers to avoid simultaneous channel compression.

Result: Achieved 5% improvement on REDDIT-BINARY and 4% improvement on Peptides-struct datasets for graph classification tasks.

Conclusion: Asynchronous message passing with centrality-based batching effectively alleviates oversquashing while maintaining theoretical feature sensitivity bounds.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from Oversquashing, which occurs when
tasks require long-range interactions. The problem arises from the presence of
bottlenecks that limit the propagation of messages among distant nodes.
Recently, graph rewiring methods modify edge connectivity and are expected to
perform well on long-range tasks. Yet, graph rewiring compromises the inductive
bias, incurring significant information loss in solving the downstream task.
Furthermore, increasing channel capacity may overcome information bottlenecks
but enhance the parameter complexity of the model. To alleviate these
shortcomings, we propose an efficient model-agnostic framework that
asynchronously updates node features, unlike traditional synchronous message
passing GNNs. Our framework creates node batches in every layer based on the
node centrality values. The features of the nodes belonging to these batches
will only get updated. Asynchronous message updates process information
sequentially across layers, avoiding simultaneous compression into
fixed-capacity channels. We also theoretically establish that our proposed
framework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds compared to standard
synchronous approaches. Our framework is applied to six standard graph datasets
and two long-range datasets to perform graph classification and achieves
impressive performances with a $5\%$ and $4\%$ improvements on REDDIT-BINARY
and Peptides-struct, respectively.

*Vittorio Giammarino,Ruiqi Ni,Ahmed H. Qureshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-informed regularization for offline goal-conditioned RL using Eikonal PDE to improve value learning and generalization in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline GCRL faces challenges with limited dataset coverage and long-horizon generalization, especially in costly domains like autonomous navigation where interactive data collection is unsafe.

Method: Proposes Physics-informed (Pi) regularized loss derived from Eikonal PDE, integrated with Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL) to create Pi-HIQL, encouraging value functions to align with cost-to-go structures.

Result: Significant improvements in performance and generalization, particularly in stitching regimes and large-scale navigation tasks.

Conclusion: Physics-informed regularization grounded in continuous-time optimal control provides effective geometric inductive bias for offline GCRL, enhancing value learning and task generalization.

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise
for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting
interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in
practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the
state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on
these challenges, we propose a Physics-informed (Pi) regularized loss for value
learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and
which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike
generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our
formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value
functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is
broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be
integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with
Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Physics-informed
HIQL (Pi-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and
generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale
navigation tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes safe-by-coevolution framework R²AI that combines resistance to known threats with resilience to unforeseen risks through adversarial learning and continuous safety-capability coevolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the growing gap between rapidly advancing AI capabilities and lagging safety progress, highlighting limitations of existing reactive safety approaches.

Method: Introduces R²AI framework with fast/slow safe models, safety wind tunnel for adversarial simulation/verification, and continual feedback loops for safety-capability coevolution.

Result: Provides a scalable proactive framework for maintaining safety in dynamic environments, addressing both immediate vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks.

Conclusion: Safe-by-coevolution offers a practical path forward for AI safety that can scale with advancing capabilities toward AGI/ASI through continuous adversarial learning processes.

Abstract: In this position paper, we address the persistent gap between rapidly growing
AI capabilities and lagging safety progress. Existing paradigms divide into
``Make AI Safe'', which applies post-hoc alignment and guardrails but remains
brittle and reactive, and ``Make Safe AI'', which emphasizes intrinsic safety
but struggles to address unforeseen risks in open-ended environments. We
therefore propose \textit{safe-by-coevolution} as a new formulation of the
``Make Safe AI'' paradigm, inspired by biological immunity, in which safety
becomes a dynamic, adversarial, and ongoing learning process. To operationalize
this vision, we introduce \texttt{R$^2$AI} -- \textit{Resistant and Resilient
AI} -- as a practical framework that unites resistance against known threats
with resilience to unforeseen risks. \texttt{R$^2$AI} integrates \textit{fast
and slow safe models}, adversarial simulation and verification through a
\textit{safety wind tunnel}, and continual feedback loops that guide safety and
capability to coevolve. We argue that this framework offers a scalable and
proactive path to maintain continual safety in dynamic environments, addressing
both near-term vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks as AI advances
toward AGI and ASI.

*William Xu,Yiwei Lu,Yihan Wang,Matthew Y. R. Yang,Zuoqiu Liu,Gautam Kamath,Yaoliang Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates why certain test samples are more vulnerable to targeted data poisoning attacks and proposes three predictive criteria to assess attack difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Targeted data poisoning attacks pose a serious threat as they can manipulate predictions for specific test samples while being easy to deploy with high success rates, raising the need to understand what makes certain samples more susceptible.

Method: The authors introduce three predictive criteria for targeted data poisoning difficulty: ergodic prediction accuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and poison budget, and conduct experiments to validate these metrics.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metrics effectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning attacks across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides practitioners with valuable insights for vulnerability assessment and enhances understanding of data poisoning attacks through effective predictive criteria.

Abstract: Targeted data poisoning attacks pose an increasingly serious threat due to
their ease of deployment and high success rates. These attacks aim to
manipulate the prediction for a single test sample in classification models.
Unlike indiscriminate attacks that aim to decrease overall test performance,
targeted attacks present a unique threat to individual test instances. This
threat model raises a fundamental question: what factors make certain test
samples more susceptible to successful poisoning than others? We investigate
how attack difficulty varies across different test instances and identify key
characteristics that influence vulnerability. This paper introduces three
predictive criteria for targeted data poisoning difficulty: ergodic prediction
accuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and
poison budget. Our experimental results demonstrate that these metrics
effectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning
attacks across diverse scenarios, offering practitioners valuable insights for
vulnerability assessment and understanding data poisoning attacks.

TL;DR: SEELE is a novel RLVR framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty by appending adaptive-length hints to optimize learning efficiency, outperforming previous methods by significant margins on math reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods suffer from exploration inefficiency due to mismatches between problem difficulty and model capability - models fail on overly difficult problems and learn little from simple ones.

Method: SEELE appends adaptive-length hints to problems, using multi-round rollout sampling and item response theory modeling to dynamically determine optimal hint length that keeps problems in the high-efficiency learning region.

Result: Outperforms GRPO by +11.8 points and SFT by +10.5 points, surpassing the best previous supervision-aided approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic difficulty adjustment through adaptive hinting significantly improves exploration efficiency and reasoning capabilities in LLMs, making RLVR more effective.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable
success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration
inefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the
model's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems
are overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are
too simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by
quantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.
Building on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR
framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the
high-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint
(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous
hint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint
length for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the
optimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In
each round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs
collected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next
round. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem
difficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration
efficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5
points, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided
approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel gradient-based optimization approach for neutron reflectometry data analysis using automatic differentiation to enable efficient and physically intuitive parameter estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutron reflectometry requires solving inverse modeling problems that are inefficient for large datasets or complex structures, and existing machine learning surrogates lose physical intuition.

Method: Uses automatic differentiation to compute exact gradients of the error function with respect to parameters, enabling gradient descent optimization on the forward reflection model itself.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on oxide quartz films and robust co-fitting for complex organic LED multilayer devices.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient, physically intuitive alternative to traditional optimization and ML approaches, with an open-source differentiable reflectometry library for broader application.

Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and
interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the
physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density,
roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is
inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g.
lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models
have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines.
Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when
replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a
novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by
performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein,
automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of
the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these
quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful
modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited
in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case
studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz
film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of
organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library
of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so
that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.

TL;DR: Two-layer neural networks can learn arbitrary word operations in finite groups and exhibit grokking behavior by finding low-rank tensor implementations using group representation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural networks can learn complex group operations and exhibit grokking phenomena, particularly focusing on the mechanisms behind learning word operations in finite groups.

Method: Reframe the problem as learning a 3-tensor, show it's typically low-rank, decompose along triplets of self-conjugate group representations, and analyze through a more tractable surrogate model. Study network's ability to find low-rank implementations under gradient descent.

Result: Networks can learn arbitrary word operations in finite groups by finding low-rank tensor implementations, effectively implementing efficient matrix multiplication similar to Strassen's method, and exhibit grokking behavior during this process.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into how neural networks achieve efficient implementations of group operations through low-rank tensor decompositions and explains the grokking phenomenon in this context, with implications for understanding network learning mechanisms.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a simple two-layer neural network with
standard activation functions can learn an arbitrary word operation in any
finite group, provided sufficient width is available and exhibits grokking
while doing so. To explain the mechanism by which this is achieved, we reframe
the problem as that of learning a particular $3$-tensor, which we show is
typically of low rank. A key insight is that low-rank implementations of this
tensor can be obtained by decomposing it along triplets of basic self-conjugate
representations of the group and leveraging the fusion structure to rule out
many components. Focusing on a phenomenologically similar but more tractable
surrogate model, we show that the network is able to find such low-rank
implementations (or approximations thereof), thereby using limited width to
approximate the word-tensor in a generalizable way. In the case of the simple
multiplication word, we further elucidate the form of these low-rank
implementations, showing that the network effectively implements efficient
matrix multiplication in the sense of Strassen. Our work also sheds light on
the mechanism by which a network reaches such a solution under gradient
descent.

### [157] [Outcome-based Exploration for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06941)
*Yuda Song,Julia Kempe,Remi Munos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL improves LLM reasoning but reduces diversity. Outcome-based exploration with UCB-style bonuses and batch penalties maintains accuracy while preserving diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL post-training enhances reasoning accuracy but causes systematic diversity loss, which undermines real-world performance where diversity is critical for test-time scaling.

Method: Propose outcome-based exploration with two algorithms: historical exploration (UCB-style bonuses for rare answers) and batch exploration (penalizing within-batch repetition).

Result: Experiments on math reasoning tasks with Llama and Qwen models show both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity collapse.

Conclusion: Outcome-based exploration provides a practical RL approach that enhances reasoning without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,
which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields
substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation
diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is
critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL
post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce
effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our
study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,
where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and
(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a
limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose
outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final
outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,
which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch
exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time
diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models
demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity
collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based
exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these
contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning
without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how players can strategically conceal their map abstractions in competitive scenarios, particularly in defense contexts where understanding an opponent's environmental perception can be exploited.

Method: Modeled as a Bayesian game where Defender selects barrier configurations based on beliefs about Attacker's abstraction, while Attacker chooses trajectories to obfuscate its abstraction. Solved using a bilinear programming approach integrating Bayesian inference, strategic planning, and belief manipulation.

Result: Purposeful abstraction concealment emerges as an effective strategy for Attackers to improve performance. Simulations show Attackers can shape Defender beliefs to induce suboptimal barrier placements, gaining strategic advantage.

Conclusion: Strategic concealment of environmental abstractions provides a meaningful advantage in competitive games, with bilinear programming effectively solving the Bayesian game formulation and demonstrating practical benefits for the concealing player.

Abstract: This paper investigates the strategic concealment of map abstractions used by
the players in competitive games. We consider a defense scenario in which one
player (the Defender) seeks to infer and exploit the abstraction used by the
other player (the Attacker). The interaction between the two players is modeled
as a Bayesian game: the Defender selects a barrier configuration, i.e., a
placement of obstacles that can obstruct the Attacker's movement, based on its
belief about the Attacker's abstraction, while the Attacker chooses a
trajectory that may intentionally obfuscate its own abstraction of the
environment to mislead the Defender. We show that purposeful abstraction
concealment naturally emerges from this formulation as a means of improving the
Attacker's performance. To solve the game, we propose a bilinear programming
approach that integrates Bayesian inference, strategic planning, and belief
manipulation. Simulations demonstrate that, by shaping the Defender's belief,
the Attacker can induce suboptimal Defender barrier placement, thereby gaining
a strategic advantage.

### [159] [Systematic Evaluation of Multi-modal Approaches to Complex Player Profile Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05624)
*Jason Starace,Terence Soule*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Multi-modal classification combining behavioral telemetry and semantic context achieves 21% accuracy for 36 player profiles, significantly outperforming behavioral-only approaches (10% accuracy) but showing limitations without conversational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional player modeling uses simplified 5-10 category taxonomies that fail to capture player diversity, and behavioral clustering cannot distinguish players with different motivations who exhibit similar actions.

Method: Systematic evaluation using 19,413 gameplay sessions from an AI-controlled text-based RPG, comparing behavioral-only baselines with multi-modal approaches that integrate action sequences and semantic descriptions using LSTM models processing action-text pairs.

Result: Multi-modal LSTM achieved 21% accuracy (vs 10% for behavioral-only), with non-neutral profiles reaching 42% accuracy (15x above random) while neutral profiles dropped to 25% (9x above random). Behavioral data alone plateaus near 10% for 36 categories.

Conclusion: Personality-based adaptation requires conversational interaction as predefined choices cannot capture intent. Multi-modal integration enables better player understanding but has limits without access to reasoning, establishing benchmarks for complex player modeling at scale.

Abstract: Modern adaptive games require nuanced player understanding, yet most models
use simplified 5-10 category taxonomies that fail to capture diversity.
Behavioral clustering cannot distinguish players with different motivations who
act similarly. We present a systematic evaluation of multi-modal classification
at scale, combining behavioral telemetry with semantic context to support 36
player profiles. Using 19,413 gameplay sessions from an AI-controlled
text-based RPG, we compared behavioral-only baselines with multi-modal
approaches that integrate action sequences and semantic descriptions.
Traditional clustering achieved only 10% accuracy for 36-category
classification, limited by semantic conflation where opposite actions produced
identical features. Our multi-modal LSTM processing action-text pairs improved
accuracy to 21%, showing both potential and limits of non-conversational data.
Analysis by behavioral complexity revealed that non-neutral profiles reached
42% accuracy (15x above random), while neutral profiles dropped to 25% (9x
above random). Identical actions such as "help the merchant" cannot reveal
whether a player is neutral or strategically waiting. Without access to
reasoning, even multi-modal models struggle, though above-baseline results
confirm a meaningful signal. Since prediction beyond 20 categories remains
unexplored, our findings establish benchmarks for complex player modeling.
Behavioral data alone plateaus near 10% for 36 categories, while multi-modal
integration enables 25%. For designers, this shows that personality-based
adaptation requires conversational interaction, as predefined choices cannot
capture intent. Our evaluation at 36-category scale offers guidance for
building adaptive games that better understand their players.

*Lukas Beckenbauer,Johannes-Lucas Loewe,Ge Zheng,Alexandra Brintrup*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Orchestrator is a novel multi-agent system framework that uses attention-inspired coordination and reflective benchmarking to improve performance in complex, non-linear tasks with partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in LLM-enhanced multi-agent systems where partial observability and poor coordination limit performance in complex, non-linear tasks.

Method: Proposes Orchestrator framework with monitoring mechanism to track agent-environment dynamics, using attention-inspired self-emergent coordination and active inference benchmarks to optimize system behavior.

Result: Evaluated on maze puzzles of increasing complexity, demonstrating improved coordination and performance in dynamic, non-linear environments with long-horizon objectives.

Conclusion: Orchestrator effectively mitigates partial observability effects and enables more efficient approximation of global task solutions through enhanced coordination mechanisms.

Abstract: Complex, non-linear tasks challenge LLM-enhanced multi-agent systems (MAS)
due to partial observability and suboptimal coordination. We propose
Orchestrator, a novel MAS framework that leverages attention-inspired
self-emergent coordination and reflective benchmarking to optimize global task
performance. Orchestrator introduces a monitoring mechanism to track
agent-environment dynamics, using active inference benchmarks to optimize
system behavior. By tracking agent-to-agent and agent-to-environment
interaction, Orchestrator mitigates the effects of partial observability and
enables agents to approximate global task solutions more efficiently. We
evaluate the framework on a series of maze puzzles of increasing complexity,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing coordination and performance in
dynamic, non-linear environments with long-horizon objectives.

### [161] [MAPF-HD: Multi-Agent Path Finding in High-Density Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06374)
*Hiroya Makino,Seigo Ito*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Proposes PHANS method for multi-agent path finding in high-density environments, solving MAPF problems in seconds instead of minutes/hours like ILP approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MAPF methods struggle with high agent density scenarios where optimizing paths for all agents simultaneously becomes computationally expensive, making them impractical for real-world applications like warehouses.

Method: Phased Null-Agent Swapping (PHANS) - a heuristic approach that incrementally swaps positions between agents and empty vertices to efficiently resolve path conflicts in dense environments.

Result: PHANS solves MAPF-HD problems within seconds to tens of seconds, even in large environments with over 700 cells, significantly outperforming ILP-based methods that take tens to hundreds of seconds for smaller grids.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables practical application of multi-agent path finding in high-density real-world scenarios like warehouse logistics, traffic management, and crowd control by dramatically reducing computation time while maintaining solution quality.

Abstract: Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) involves planning efficient paths for
multiple agents to move simultaneously while avoiding collisions. In typical
warehouse environments, agents are often sparsely distributed along aisles.
However, increasing the agent density can improve space efficiency. When the
agent density is high, we must optimize the paths not only for goal-assigned
agents but also for those obstructing them. This study proposes a novel MAPF
framework for high-density environments (MAPF-HD). Several studies have
explored MAPF in similar settings using integer linear programming (ILP).
However, ILP-based methods require substantial computation time to optimize all
agent paths simultaneously. Even in small grid-based environments with fewer
than $100$ cells, these computations can incur tens to hundreds of seconds.
These high computational costs render these methods impractical for large-scale
applications such as automated warehouses and valet parking. To address these
limitations, we introduce the phased null-agent swapping (PHANS) method. PHANS
employs a heuristic approach to incrementally swap positions between agents and
empty vertices. This method solves the MAPF-HD problem within seconds to tens
of seconds, even in large environments containing more than $700$ cells. The
proposed method can potentially improve efficiency in various real-world
applications such as warehouse logistics, traffic management, or crowd control.

*Arthur Casals,Anarosa A. F. Brandão*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: HECATE is an ECS-based framework that bridges distributed systems engineering with multiagent systems development, reducing the need for specialized agent knowledge by leveraging familiar DS patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify multiagent systems development by integrating agent concepts into distributed systems domain and reducing the requirement for specialized agent knowledge.

Method: Uses Entity-Component-System architectural pattern with data-oriented design to implement multiagent systems from a distributed systems perspective.

Result: Developed a framework architecture with core components that supports different agent models while minimizing agent-specific knowledge requirements.

Conclusion: HECATE successfully bridges distributed systems and MAS development, making MAS engineering more accessible through familiar DS patterns and standards.

Abstract: This paper introduces HECATE, a novel framework based on the
Entity-Component-System (ECS) architectural pattern that bridges the gap
between distributed systems engineering and MAS development. HECATE is built
using the Entity-Component-System architectural pattern, leveraging
data-oriented design to implement multiagent systems. This approach involves
engineering multiagent systems (MAS) from a distributed systems (DS)
perspective, integrating agent concepts directly into the DS domain. This
approach simplifies MAS development by (i) reducing the need for specialized
agent knowledge and (ii) leveraging familiar DS patterns and standards to
minimize the agent-specific knowledge required for engineering MAS. We present
the framework's architecture, core components, and implementation approach,
demonstrating how it supports different agent models.

### [163] [Nanobot Algorithms for Treatment of Diffuse Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06893)
*Noble Harasha,Nancy Lynch*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Three nanobot algorithms for targeted drug delivery to multiple cancer sites: KM (natural signals), KMA (amplified signals), and KMAR (repulsion from treated sites). KMAR shows best performance across all cancer patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve targeted drug delivery for diffuse cancers with multiple sites by developing coordinated nanobot swarms that can allocate drug payloads according to site demands.

Method: Mathematical model of nanobot behavior with movement based on experimental nanoparticle data. Three algorithms: KM (follows natural chemical signals), KMA (amplifies signals), KMAR (adds repulsion from treated sites). Simulations across different cancer arrangements.

Result: KM successful unless weak signals cause slow treatment. KMA improves speed but reduces success except for concentrated patterns. KMAR shows great performance, robustness, and adaptability across all cancer patterns.

Conclusion: KMAR algorithm with repulsion mechanism provides the most effective and adaptable approach for nanobot-based drug delivery to multiple cancer sites, demonstrating superior coordination and treatment outcomes.

Abstract: Motile nanosized particles, or "nanobots", promise more effective and less
toxic targeted drug delivery because of their unique scale and precision. We
consider the case in which the cancer is "diffuse", dispersed such that there
are multiple distinct cancer sites. We investigate the problem of a swarm of
nanobots locating these sites and treating them by dropping drug payloads at
the sites. To improve the success of the treatment, the drug payloads must be
allocated between sites according to their "demands"; this requires extra
nanobot coordination. We present a mathematical model of the behavior of the
nanobot agents and of their colloidal environment. This includes a movement
model for agents based upon experimental findings from actual nanoparticles in
which bots noisily ascend and descend chemical gradients. We present three
algorithms: The first algorithm, called KM, is the most representative of
reality, with agents simply following naturally existing chemical signals that
surround each cancer site. The second algorithm, KMA, includes an additional
chemical payload which amplifies the existing natural signals. The third
algorithm, KMAR, includes another additional chemical payload which counteracts
the other signals, instead inducing negative chemotaxis in agents such that
they are repelled from sites that are already sufficiently treated. We present
simulation results for all algorithms across different types of cancer
arrangements. For KM, we show that the treatment is generally successful unless
the natural chemical signals are weak, in which case the treatment progresses
too slowly. For KMA, we demonstrate a significant improvement in treatment
speed but a drop in eventual success, except for concentrated cancer patterns.
For KMAR, our results show great performance across all types of cancer
patterns, demonstrating robustness and adaptability.
