However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings.

Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by\nthe individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency\ncomputing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,\nallowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of\ncomputing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across\nthe cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing\ncontext, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers\nmanifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.\nIn this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to\ncloud robotic manipulation.

To address these issues, we propose the\nMultimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,\nwhich mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment\nas a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality\nvariations.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two\ntasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a\ndynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of\n81%, while preserving the accuracy.

Although numerous physically based and machine\nlearning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and\ncomputational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major\nchallenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological\nPrediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that\nleverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first\napplies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 \"uncalibrated\" catchment-based\nconceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear\nregression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that\nensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the\nrequired BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged\nbasins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from\n87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta\nEfficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)\nbut required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%\nof basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower\nuncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).\nThese results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not\nnecessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is\nassembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER\nprovides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge\nprediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide\nrange of regions."}
