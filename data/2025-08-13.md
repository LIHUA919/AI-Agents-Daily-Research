### [1] [Topos Theory for Generative AI and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08293)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel generative AI architectures (GAIAs) using topos theory, leveraging category theory to design compositional structures for LLMs, and validates their theoretical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new architectures for LLMs by applying category theory, specifically topos theory, to create more flexible and powerful compositional structures beyond traditional linear or mixture-of-experts designs.

Method: Uses universal constructions in category theory (pullback, pushout, (co)equalizers, etc.) to derive new LLM architectures, and theoretically validates their properties by proving the category of LLMs is (co)complete and forms a topos.

Result: The category of LLMs is shown to be (co)complete and forms a topos, enabling the design of novel architectures with properties like exponential objects and subobject classifiers.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of category theory, particularly topos theory, in advancing LLM architectures through theoretically grounded compositional structures.

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

### [2] [Topos Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08295)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Topos causal models (TCMs) leverage topos category properties for causal inference, enabling solutions for complex causal diagrams, interventions via subobject classifiers, and reasoning about causal equivalences using exponential objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that topos category properties (completeness, subobject classifiers, exponential objects) are central to causal inference, offering new tools for modeling and solving causal problems.

Method: Define TCMs using topos properties, prove their (co)completeness, and apply these properties to causal interventions, approximations, and equivalences.

Result: TCMs provide a framework for solving arbitrary causal diagrams via (co)limits, modeling interventions with subobject classifiers, and reasoning about causal operations using exponential objects.

Conclusion: TCMs, as a topos, offer a powerful categorical framework for causal inference, with internal logic enabling formal reasoning about causal models.

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

### [3] [An Efficient Application of Goal Programming to Tackle Multiobjective Problems with Recurring Fitness Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08297)
*Rodrigo Lankaites Pinheiro,Dario Landa-Silva,Wasakorn Laesanklang,Ademir Aparecido Constantino*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method combining multiobjective algorithms and Goal Programming is proposed to efficiently solve similar problem instances in constrained many-objective scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of obtaining good approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems, especially when problem instances share similarities in fitness landscapes.

Method: Solve one instance with expensive multiobjective algorithms, then use Goal Programming and single-objective algorithms for similar instances. Three goal-based objective functions are employed.

Result: Effective results on benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time windows, achieving good solutions quickly.

Conclusion: The methodology leverages multiobjective algorithm effectiveness and Goal Programming efficiency for similar problem instances, yielding good compromise solutions.

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

### [4] [LLM-BI: Towards Fully Automated Bayesian Inference with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08300)
*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs to automate Bayesian inference tasks, demonstrating success in eliciting priors and specifying model structures from natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian inference requires expertise in specifying priors and likelihoods, limiting its adoption. This paper aims to automate these steps using LLMs.

Method: Introduces LLM-BI, a pipeline for automating Bayesian workflows. Tests it in two experiments: eliciting priors (Experiment I) and specifying full model structures (Experiment II) for Bayesian linear regression.

Result: LLMs successfully elicited priors and specified model structures from natural language, validating their potential for automating Bayesian workflows.

Conclusion: LLMs can automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, paving the way for automated probabilistic programming pipelines.

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

### [5] [First Ask Then Answer: A Framework Design for AI Dialogue Based on Supplementary Questioning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08308)
*Chuanruo Fu,Yuncheng Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FATA is a new interaction paradigm for LLMs that proactively asks users supplementary questions before answering, improving response quality and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail with incomplete or ill-specified queries, needing a better way to gather comprehensive user input.

Method: FATA uses prompting to generate multidimensional supplementary questions upfront, integrates user responses, and employs sophisticated prompting for improved answers.

Result: FATA outperforms baseline prompts by ~40% and shows better stability than expert prompts.

Conclusion: FATA enhances LLM performance by scaffolding user input, emphasizing completeness and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

### [6] [What Breaks Knowledge Graph based RAG? Empirical Insights into Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08344)
*Dongzhuoran Zhou,Yuqicheng Zhu,Xiaxia Wang,Hongkuan Zhou,Yuan He,Jiaoyan Chen,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current KG-RAG evaluation practices, proposes a new benchmark method, and reveals limitations in reasoning under missing knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KG-RAG evaluations are flawed due to direct answer retrieval in benchmarks, inconsistent metrics, and lenient matching, obscuring true reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces a general benchmark construction method and evaluation protocol to assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge incompleteness.

Result: Current KG-RAG methods show limited reasoning with missing knowledge, rely on memorization, and vary in generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and protocol highlight KG-RAG's reasoning gaps, urging improved evaluation and model design.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

### [7] [UrzaGPT: LoRA-Tuned Large Language Models for Card Selection in Collectible Card Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08382)
*Timo Bertram*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UrzaGPT, a domain-adapted LLM, improves drafting decisions in Magic: The Gathering, achieving 66.2% accuracy with fine-tuning, outperforming zero-shot LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models underperform in CCGs like Magic: The Gathering due to partial observability and evolving card sets. UrzaGPT aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Fine-tuned an open-weight LLM (Low-Rank Adaptation) on annotated draft logs to adapt to game expansions and leverage language modeling.

Result: UrzaGPT achieved 66.2% accuracy with 10,000 steps, surpassing zero-shot LLMs (43%) but not domain-specific models.

Conclusion: LLMs like UrzaGPT can enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs, though further improvements are needed.

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

### [8] [Bilevel MCTS for Amortized O(1) Node Selection in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08385)
*Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bilevel MCTS modification and Tree Collapsing to improve the efficiency of node selection in classical planning, achieving amortized O(1) runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS in classical planning suffers from high runtime complexity (O(log N)) for node selection due to large search depths, unlike in game tree search where it's negligible.

Method: Introduces a bilevel MCTS modification with best-first search from selected leaf nodes and Tree Collapsing to reduce action selection steps.

Result: Achieves amortized O(1) runtime for node selection, matching traditional queue-based OPEN lists, and enhances performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address the bottleneck in MCTS for classical planning, improving efficiency.

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

### [9] [Solver-Aided Expansion of Loops to Avoid Generate-and-Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08442)
*Niklas Dewally,Özgür Akgün*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method to optimize constraint model compilation by avoiding full enumeration of induction variables, using solver-based computation for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard approaches inefficiently generate all combinations of induction variables, even when most are irrelevant, slowing down compilation.

Method: Uses a solver to compute only necessary combinations of induction variables, avoiding full enumeration.

Result: Produces the same model as conventional flattening but with significantly faster compilation.

Conclusion: Improves efficiency in translating high-level models to solver-ready form, especially for large domains with selective preconditions.

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

### [10] [OverFill: Two-Stage Models for Efficient Language Model Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08446)
*Woojeong Kim,Junxiong Wang,Jing Nathan Yan,Mohamed Abdelfattah,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OverFill decouples prefill and decode stages in LLM inference to optimize efficiency and accuracy, outperforming pruned models by up to 83.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs and inefficiencies in LLMs due to uniform handling of prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages.

Method: OverFill uses a full model for prefill and switches to a dense pruned model for decode, leveraging parallel processing and sequential token generation.

Result: OverFill configurations (3B-to-1B and 8B-to-3B) outperform pruned models by 83.2% and 79.2%, respectively, matching performance of same-sized models with less training data.

Conclusion: OverFill effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in LLM inference, offering a practical solution for deployment challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

### [11] [A Fast GRASP Metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc TSP with MIP-Based Construction and Multi-Neighborhood Local Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08477)
*Joan Salvà Soler,Grégoire de Lambertye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A GRASP-based metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) achieves near-optimal solutions efficiently, outperforming Gurobi on synthetic data and ranking top in competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The TA-TSP models dynamic arc costs in scenarios like warehouse operations, requiring efficient solutions for real-time routing with state-dependent costs.

Method: Combines construction heuristics (using MIP) with multi-neighborhood local search (2-Opt, Swap, Relocate) to solve TA-TSP.

Result: Achieved 0.77% and 0.40% optimality gaps on competition instances and 11.3% better solutions than Gurobi on synthetic data.

Conclusion: The method is effective for real-time routing with dynamic costs, as demonstrated by its competition performance.

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel
costs.

### [12] [Beyond Ordinal Preferences: Why Alignment Needs Cardinal Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08486)
*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ordinal preference data is insufficient for optimal LLM alignment; cardinal feedback is needed. A new dataset of 25,000 cardinal judgments improves model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods rely on ordinal preference data, which lacks the granularity to resolve tradeoffs and identify the most preferred model.

Method: Proves the limitation of ordinal data, introduces cardinal feedback via willingness-to-pay elicitations, and releases a dataset of 25,000 cardinal judgments.

Result: Incorporating cardinal feedback outperforms ordinal-only methods, prioritizing high-impact improvements and achieving better performance on benchmarks like Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: Cardinal feedback is essential for optimal LLM alignment, addressing fundamental limitations of ordinal data.

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

*Szymon Jakubicz,Karol Kuźniak,Jan Wawszczak,Paweł Gora*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Improved POMO (POMO+) for better performance in combinatorial problems like VRP, showing faster convergence and better results on CVRPLIB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance POMO's performance in solving combinatorial problems, particularly VRP variants, by leveraging initial nodes more effectively.

Method: Developed POMO+, an improved version of POMO, using initial nodes for more informed solutions.

Result: POMO+ converges faster and achieves better results, validated on CVRPLIB for instances up to 100 customers.

Conclusion: POMO+ advances RL-based solutions for combinatorial problems, with potential for further improvements.

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

### [14] [Large Language Models as Oracles for Ontology Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08500)
*Sviatoslav Lushnei,Dmytro Shumskyi,Severyn Shykula,Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz,Artur d'Avila Garcez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to validate uncertain ontology alignments as an alternative to costly human experts, evaluating performance on OAEI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human involvement in ontology alignment is expensive, especially for large ontologies, prompting the need for alternatives like LLMs.

Method: LLMs validate uncertain alignments identified by ontology alignment systems, tested on OAEI tasks with various prompt templates.

Result: LLM performance is evaluated against simulated Oracles, showing feasibility for reducing human effort.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively validate uncertain alignments, offering a scalable alternative to human experts.

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

*Yuchen Li,Cong Lin,Muhammad Umair Nasir,Philip Bontrager,Jialin Liu,Julian Togelius*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GVGAI-LLM is a video game benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reasoning and problem-solving, featuring diverse arcade-style games to test spatial reasoning and planning. It uses a game description language for rapid creation and ASCII representations for efficiency. Metrics like meaningful step ratio and step efficiency assess model behavior, revealing LLMs' persistent limitations in spatial reasoning. Structured prompting and spatial grounding help but don't solve the benchmark, making it a testbed for advancing LLM research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' reasoning and problem-solving capabilities in tasks differing from existing benchmarks, focusing on spatial reasoning and planning.

Method: Uses the General Video Game AI framework with a game description language for rapid game creation and ASCII representations for efficiency. Defines metrics like meaningful step ratio and step efficiency.

Result: LLMs show persistent limitations in spatial reasoning and planning, with spatial and logical errors. Interventions like structured prompting improve performance but don't solve the benchmark.

Conclusion: GVGAI-LLM serves as a reproducible testbed for advancing LLM research, particularly in agentic behavior and contextual reasoning, highlighting unresolved challenges.

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

*Arshia Ilaty,Hossein Shirazi,Hajar Homayouni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SynLLM is a framework using LLMs to generate synthetic medical data with structured prompts, ensuring clinical validity and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Restricted access to real medical data hinders research; synthetic data offers a solution but lacks realism and privacy safeguards.

Method: SynLLM employs 20 open-source LLMs with four prompt types (example-driven to rule-based) for controlled generation, evaluated across statistical, clinical, and privacy metrics.

Result: Rule-based prompts balance privacy and quality best. SynLLM shows LLMs can produce clinically valid, privacy-conscious synthetic medical data.

Conclusion: Well-designed prompts and robust evaluation enable LLMs to generate high-quality, privacy-aware synthetic medical data, advancing healthcare research.

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

*Zhichao Wang,Xinhai Chen,Qinglin Wang,Xiang Gao,Qingyang Zhang,Menghan Jia,Xiang Zhang,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UGM2N is an unsupervised, generalizable mesh movement network that improves simulation accuracy and efficiency by dynamically relocating mesh nodes, outperforming traditional and supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mesh movement techniques are computationally complex and inflexible, while supervised learning methods struggle with generalization across diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.

Method: UGM2N uses unsupervised mesh adaptation with localized geometric feature learning and a physics-constrained loss function (M-Uniform loss) for nodal-level equidistribution.

Result: The network shows equation-agnostic generalization, geometric independence, scalability, and consistent superiority over existing methods, including error reduction without mesh tangling.

Conclusion: UGM2N effectively addresses the limitations of traditional and supervised methods, offering robust and efficient mesh adaptation for diverse PDEs and geometries.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

TL;DR: AgriGPT is a specialized LLM ecosystem for agriculture, featuring a scalable data engine, Tri-RAG for enhanced reasoning, and AgriBench-13K for evaluation, outperforming general-purpose LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited application of LLMs in agriculture due to lack of domain-specific models, datasets, and evaluation frameworks.

Method: Develop AgriGPT with a multi-agent data engine (Agri-342K dataset), Tri-RAG (dense/sparse retrieval + knowledge graph reasoning), and AgriBench-13K for evaluation.

Result: AgriGPT outperforms general-purpose LLMs in domain adaptation and reasoning.

Conclusion: AgriGPT offers a modular, extensible framework for domain-specialized LLMs, with open release to empower agricultural communities.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

*HuanYu Yang,Fengming Zhu,YangFan Wu,Jianmin Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'diminution' to reduce the grounding bottleneck in Answer Set Programming (ASP) by selecting subsets of the Herbrand universe, improving performance and grounding file size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The grounding bottleneck in ASP, caused by large Herbrand universes, motivates the need for a formal and generalizable strategy to improve grounding performance.

Method: The paper defines diminution as a subset of the Herbrand universe, analyzes its properties, and uses an encoding for ASP solvers to evaluate subsets. It integrates with existing grounders via domain predicates.

Result: Experiments show up to 70% reduction in grounding time and 85% decrease in grounding file size across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: Diminution is a robust and general-purpose approach to alleviate the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting meaningful insights from complex EHR data is difficult due to sparsity, heterogeneity, and feature costs, necessitating a tailored solution.

Method: Proposes an online, cost-aware feature selection framework for EHR data, incorporating budgetary constraints and feature variability costs.

Result: The framework manages sparse, multimodal data effectively, supporting scalable and robust performance in healthcare contexts.

Conclusion: The method enhances diagnostic confidence and resource optimization by guiding incremental feature acquisition for physicians.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

*Vishakha Lall,Yisi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prompt-and-Check, a method using open-source LLMs to evaluate procedural communication compliance in simulation-based training via prompt-based inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate compliance evaluation is crucial in safety-critical domains, and current methods often lack efficiency or deployability.

Method: Uses context-rich prompts with LLMs (e.g., LLama 2 7B, Mistral 7B) to assess checklist fulfillment from transcribed verbal exchanges, tested in a maritime case study.

Result: Prompting enables effective compliance judgment without task-specific training, validated against expert annotations.

Conclusion: LLMs can augment debriefing and automated assessment in training, showcasing practical utility.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

TL;DR: A hybrid optimization solver combining machine learning (GNNs) and metaheuristics improves CVRP solutions by strategically selecting nodes for removal, enhancing performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance metaheuristic algorithms' performance in solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by reducing complexity and scaling the search space.

Method: Integrates a Node-Destroyer Model using GNNs to guide the LNS operator in metaheuristic frameworks, leveraging graph representations for strategic node removal.

Result: Improves solution quality for standard CVRP benchmarks and scales to large instances (up to 30,000 nodes) without retraining.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively boosts metaheuristic performance, offering scalable and high-quality solutions for CVRP.

Abstract: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver
developed to strengthen the performance of metaheuristic algorithms in solving
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The iterative hybrid mechanism
integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer
nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the
metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP
and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.
The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions
under similar settings.

Result: Outperforms existing models in accuracy and efficiency on JEE and other benchmarks.

Conclusion: Aryabhata is released as an open-source foundation model to enhance exam-centric learning.

Abstract: We present Aryabhata 1.0, a compact 7B parameter math reasoning model
optimized for the Indian academic exam, the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).
Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), current models often
remain unsuitable for educational use. Aryabhata 1.0 is built by merging strong

*Chen Li,Han Zhang,Zhantao Yang,Fangyi Chen,Zihan Wang,Anudeepsekhar Bolimera,Marios Savvides*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STELAR-Vision improves vision-language models by introducing topology-aware reasoning, outperforming base and larger models in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with complex multimodal tasks and verbose outputs due to reliance on chain-of-thought reasoning.

Method: Introduces TopoAug for synthetic data with diverse topologies, uses supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and proposes Frugal Learning to reduce output length.

Result: Achieves 9.7% higher accuracy than the base model, outperforms larger models by up to 28.4%, and shows strong generalization.

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision enhances reasoning and efficiency in VLMs, demonstrating superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

*Yuwei Yan,Jinghua Piao,Xiaochong Lan,Chenyang Shao,Pan Hui,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a theory-informed framework for LLM-based social agents, improving generalization and realism in social simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of a unified framework for designing general social agents, limiting their adaptability and consistency.

Method: Introduces a framework grounded in Social Cognition Theory with three modules: motivation, action planning, and learning.

Result: Achieves 75% lower deviation from real-world data; ablation shows 1.5-3.2x error increase without key modules.

Conclusion: The framework enhances agent realism and flexibility, validated by improved performance and essential module contributions.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

### [26] [Designing Memory-Augmented AR Agents for Spatiotemporal Reasoning in Personalized Task Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08774)
*Dongwook Choi,Taeyoon Kwon,Dongil Yang,Hyojun Kim,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a memory-augmented AR agent framework to enhance personalized task assistance by leveraging historical user interactions, addressing limitations in current AR systems for complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AR agents lack the ability to handle multi-step tasks requiring long-term user experience and preference understanding, due to insufficient historical interaction retention and reasoning.

Method: The framework includes four modules: Perception (multimodal sensor processing), Memory (persistent spatiotemporal storage), Spatiotemporal Reasoning (context synthesis), and Actuator (AR communication).

Result: A conceptual framework and implementation roadmap are presented, with potential applications demonstrating practical utility across domains.

Conclusion: The work aims to inspire future research for intelligent AR systems that integrate user history with adaptive, context-aware assistance.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper surveys knowledge editing in LLMs, introducing a function-based taxonomy alongside existing mechanism-focused approaches to provide a comprehensive view of the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of outdated or inaccurate knowledge in LLMs without costly retraining, focusing on how editing effectiveness varies with knowledge type.

Method: Introduces a function-based taxonomy to categorize knowledge (factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, social) and reviews editing mechanisms, evaluation tasks, and datasets.

Result: Highlights the strengths and limitations of current methods, mapping the landscape of knowledge editing in LLMs.

Conclusion: Identifies open challenges and future directions, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to knowledge editing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRainsaCK is a reusable software resource for benchmarking explanations in link prediction for Knowledge Graphs, addressing the lack of standard evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge Graphs often lack completeness, and while embedding-based link prediction methods are scalable, they lack comprehensibility. Explanation methods exist but lack standardized evaluation.

Method: GRainsaCK streamlines benchmarking tasks, from model training to explanation evaluation, using a modular and extensible design with replaceable functions.

Result: GRainsaCK provides a standardized evaluation protocol, modularity, and extensive documentation, including a tutorial, to foster reuse.

Conclusion: GRainsaCK fills a critical gap in evaluating explanations for link prediction, offering a reusable and extensible solution with comprehensive support.

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

TL;DR: E-Agent, a framework for dynamic multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (mRAG), improves accuracy by 13% and reduces redundant searches by 37% over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the rigid retrieval strategies and under-utilization of visual information in current mRAG approaches for real-world applications like news analysis.

Method: Introduces E-Agent with a mRAG planner for dynamic tool orchestration and a task executor for optimized workflows, along with the RemPlan benchmark for evaluation.

Result: E-Agent outperforms state-of-the-art mRAG methods with a 13% accuracy gain and 37% reduction in redundant searches.

Conclusion: E-Agent effectively bridges gaps in mRAG systems, offering dynamic planning and efficient execution, validated by the RemPlan benchmark.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

*Mustafa Akben,Vinayaka Gude,Haya Ajjan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs outperform humans in individual emotion recognition but are surpassed by human collective intelligence. Human-AI collaboration yields the highest accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing AI's emotional intelligence, particularly MLLMs, to improve human-AI interactions by comparing their emotion recognition abilities with humans.

Method: Evaluated MLLMs and humans using the RMET and MRMET tests, comparing individual and aggregated performances, and testing collaborative human-AI approaches.

Result: MLLMs outperformed humans individually, but human collective intelligence surpassed MLLMs. Human-AI collaboration achieved the highest accuracy.

Conclusion: Human collective intelligence and human-AI collaboration are key for advancing emotionally intelligent AI systems.

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

*Dayu Wang,Jiaye Yang,Weikang Li,Jiahui Liang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dual-agent framework improves mathematical reasoning by separating reasoning and coding tasks, reducing cognitive load interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-agent systems for mathematical reasoning impose cognitive load interference by interleaving reasoning and coding tasks.

Method: Proposes a dual-agent framework: a Reasoning Agent for problem decomposition and a Code Agent for code tasks. Training combines imitation and reinforcement learning.

Result: The dual-agent framework reduces cognitive interference and improves coordination, outperforming single-agent systems.

Conclusion: Decoupling reasoning and coding roles enhances performance and stability in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Compass-Thinker-7B, a model using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning in LLMs with reduced computational costs. It achieves strong performance in mathematics, notably 40% accuracy in AIME2024.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperscale RL experiments are costly and risky. The goal is to explore RL's potential for reasoning in LLMs with fewer resources.

Method: Compass-Thinker-7B is trained via a specialized RL pipeline using 30k verifiable math problems, with staged difficulty distributions.

Result: The model shows exceptional reasoning, outperforming same-sized RL models in math, achieving 40% accuracy in AIME2024.

Conclusion: Compass-Thinker-7B demonstrates efficient RL training for reasoning, offering insights for scaling RL to larger models.

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension
has given large language models (LLMs) unprecedented reasoning capabilities,
and Reinforcement Learning is the core technology to elicit its complex
reasoning. However, conducting RL experiments directly on hyperscale models
involves high computational costs and resource demands, posing significant
risks. We propose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the
potential of Reinforcement Learning with less computational resources and
costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the
training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL
model.Especially in the challenging AIME2024 evaluation, Compass-Thinker-7B
achieves 40% accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Implicit Reasoning Safety as a vulnerability in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and presents a dataset (Safe Semantics, Unsafe Interpretations) to study it. Simple In-Context Learning with this dataset mitigates the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety challenges in LVLMs due to flawed or hidden reasoning triggered by benign multimodal inputs.

Method: Developed the Safe Semantics, Unsafe Interpretations dataset and demonstrated mitigation using In-Context Learning.

Result: In-Context Learning with the dataset significantly reduces implicit multimodal threats.

Conclusion: Improving cross-modal implicit reasoning is urgently needed to enhance LVLM safety.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal
inputs. This paper introduces the concept of Implicit Reasoning Safety, a
vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the

### [34] [Prospect Theory Fails for LLMs: Revealing Instability of Decision-Making under Epistemic Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08992)
*Rui Wang,Qihan Lin,Jiayu Liu,Qing Zong,Tianshi Zheng,Weiqi Wang,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores whether Prospect Theory (PT) applies to Large Language Models (LLMs) and how epistemic markers influence their decision-making. It introduces a three-stage experiment and a new evaluation framework, finding PT unreliable for LLMs when uncertainty is linguistically diverse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if PT, which models human decision-making under uncertainty, applies to LLMs and how epistemic markers (e.g., 'maybe') affect their behavior.

Method: A three-stage experiment using economic questionnaires, a generalized evaluation framework for PT in LLMs, and incorporating epistemic markers with empirical probability values.

Result: PT is not consistently reliable for modeling LLMs' decision-making, especially with linguistically diverse uncertainty expressions.

Conclusion: The study highlights limitations of PT for LLMs and the impact of linguistic uncertainty, providing a framework for future research.

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

TL;DR: Intrinsic Memory Agents improve multi-agent LLM systems by addressing memory limitations with structured, evolving agent-specific memories, showing a 38.6% performance boost and better task outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent LLM systems struggle with memory consistency and role adherence due to context window limitations, hindering complex collaborative problem-solving.

Method: Introduces Intrinsic Memory Agents, using role-aligned memory templates to preserve specialized perspectives and task-relevant information.

Result: Achieves a 38.6% performance improvement on the PDDL dataset and higher quality designs in complex tasks, excelling in scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness, and documentation.

Conclusion: Structured, intrinsic memory approaches enhance multi-agent LLM systems' capabilities for structured planning tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning
tasks.

### [36] [Activation Steering for Bias Mitigation: An Interpretable Approach to Safer LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09019)
*Shivam Dubey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end system using mechanistic interpretability to detect and mitigate biases in LLMs, achieving near-perfect bias detection and real-time correction via steering vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the risk of LLMs perpetuating harmful biases, the authors propose a more direct and interpretable method than traditional opaque approaches like data filtering or post-hoc moderation.

Method: The system involves training linear probes on model activations to detect bias representations, followed by computing steering vectors to adjust activations during inference, steering outputs away from bias.

Result: Experiments on GPT-2-large show near-perfect bias detection and successful real-time mitigation, altering biased completions toward neutral alternatives.

Conclusion: The work presents a robust, reproducible system for safer, more accountable LLMs by directly addressing bias in model internals.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

*Jie Wang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FiXGBoost, a feature interaction-based XGBoost model, to predict pre-request passenger waiting time in ridesharing systems, addressing a gap in existing research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-request waiting time prediction is crucial for trip planning and improving user experience, yet it remains understudied compared to post-request prediction.

Method: The study uses a data-driven approach to analyze demand-supply dynamics, followed by feature engineering and the development of FiXGBoost, an XGBoost-based model for pre-request prediction.

Result: FiXGBoost demonstrates strong performance and explainability on a large-scale dataset with over 30 million trip records.

Conclusion: The research successfully addresses the predictability and explainability of pre-request waiting time, offering practical benefits for ridesharing platforms.

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

*Debdeep Mukherjee,Eduardo Di Santi,Clément Lefebvre,Nenad Mijatovic,Victor Martin,Thierry Josse,Jonathan Brown,Kenza Saiah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A predictive maintenance framework using deep neural networks to classify anomalies in track circuits (CVCM) before they escalate into failures, achieving 99.31% accuracy and early detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Track circuits like CVCM are safety-critical but prone to subtle, hard-to-detect anomalies that can cause cascading failures. Early detection is crucial for minimizing downtime and revenue loss.

Method: The proposed method uses deep neural networks to classify anomalies, validated on 10 CVCM failure cases. It includes conformal prediction for uncertainty estimates.

Result: Achieves 99.31% accuracy, detects anomalies within 1% of onset, and provides 99% confidence with consistent coverage across classes.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable, adaptable to other railway systems, and enhances operational reliability, complying with ISO-17359.

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

*Shixuan Sun,Siyuan Liang,Ruoyu Chen,Jianjie Huang,Jingzhi Li,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Source-aware Membership Audit (SMA) to attribute generated content in RAG/MRAG systems, addressing provenance issues and privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to reliably attribute outputs in RAG/MRAG systems, undermining accountability for privacy leaks.

Method: SMA uses semi-black-box auditing, zero-order optimization for attribution estimation, and cross-modal techniques for image inputs.

Result: SMA enables fine-grained source attribution and membership inference on image retrieval traces.

Conclusion: SMA shifts focus to content sourcing, offering a new perspective for auditing data provenance in generative systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

TL;DR: OpenCUA is an open-source framework for vision-language models (CUAs) to study capabilities, limitations, and risks. It includes annotation tools, a large-scale dataset (AgentNet), and a scalable pipeline, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open frameworks for studying CUAs, which are increasingly mediating digital interactions and executing decisions.

Method: Proposes OpenCUA with (1) annotation infrastructure for human demonstrations, (2) AgentNet dataset, and (3) a scalable pipeline for state-action pairs with Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Result: OpenCUA-32B achieves 34.8% success rate on OSWorld-Verified, surpassing GPT-4o and setting a new SOTA for open-source models.

Conclusion: OpenCUA provides tools, datasets, and models to advance open research in CUAs, demonstrating strong performance and generalization.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open
foundations for further CUA research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrowseMaster is a scalable framework using a planner-executor agent pair to balance broad search and deep reasoning, outperforming existing methods in complex information-seeking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents struggle with balancing search breadth and reasoning depth, limiting their effectiveness in information retrieval.

Method: BrowseMaster employs a programmatically augmented planner-executor pair: the planner adapts search strategies, and the executor retrieves concise evidence.

Result: BrowseMaster achieves scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: BrowseMaster effectively addresses the trade-off between search breadth and reasoning depth, excelling in complex information-seeking tasks.

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs for converting historical land patent descriptions into accurate coordinates, finding top models outperform traditional methods with cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of spatial analysis due to narrative land patent descriptions by leveraging LLMs for accurate georeferencing.

Method: Tested six OpenAI models under direct-to-coordinate and tool-augmented paradigms, comparing results with GIS-analyst and other baselines.

Result: Top model achieved a mean error of 23 km, outperforming baselines by up to 70%. Ensembles further reduced errors to 19 km.

Conclusion: LLMs offer scalable, accurate, and cost-effective solutions for historical georeferencing.

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biomedical AI struggles with understanding complex medical concepts and text-image relationships due to reliance on general foundation models and limited training data.

Method: Doctor Sun combines a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical LLM, using two-stage training (feature alignment and instruction tuning) on diverse medical datasets.

Result: The model is released alongside SunMed-VL, a bilingual medical multimodal dataset, to support further research.

Conclusion: Doctor Sun advances biomedical multimodal research by improving the integration and interpretation of medical data.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including
pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance.
However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation
LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with
limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs
struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts
and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal
generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and
interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In
particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hat-DFed, a decentralized federated learning framework addressing communication bottlenecks, resource heterogeneity, and data heterogeneity in edge computing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of communication bottlenecks, resource heterogeneity, and data heterogeneity in decentralized federated learning (DFL) for edge computing.

Method: Proposes Hat-DFed, a framework with a dual optimization problem for topology construction and a two-phase algorithm for dynamic topology optimization and model aggregation.

Result: Hat-DFed maximizes model performance while minimizing energy consumption and mitigates data heterogeneity effects.

Conclusion: Hat-DFed is an effective solution for DFL in edge computing, balancing performance and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

TL;DR: XFMNet is a multimodal fusion network for water quality prediction, integrating remote sensing and adaptive decomposition to handle temporal and spatial dynamics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Water quality prediction is challenging due to complex periodicity, nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations, especially in multi-site scenarios requiring spatial-temporal modeling.

Method: XFMNet uses adaptive downsampling, locally adaptive decomposition, and cross-attention gated fusion to integrate temporal, spatial, and ecological cues.

Result: XFMNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in real-world datasets.

Conclusion: XFMNet effectively addresses challenges in water quality prediction by capturing long-term trends and short-term fluctuations through multimodal fusion.

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six datasets, validated with three backbones and varying unlabeled ratios.

Conclusion: MoSSDA effectively handles domain shifts in time-series data, with each module contributing to performance.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

*Ningning Fu,Shengheng Liu,Weiliang Xie,Yongming Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGSTC is an online cellular traffic prediction method using multi-grained spatial-temporal features to address concept drift and sporadic traffic patterns, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current telecom industry relies on manual intervention, and existing methods overlook sporadic traffic characteristics and concept drift, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: MGSTC segments data into chunks, uses coarse-grained temporal attention for trend reference, and fine-grained spatial attention for detailed correlations, with online learning for concept drift adaptation.

Result: MGSTC consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines on four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MGSTC effectively addresses challenges in cellular traffic prediction, offering high accuracy and adaptability in continuous forecasting scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

*Mu Qiao*

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets transformer attention as Pavlovian conditioning, linking queries, keys, and values to classical conditioning elements. It provides theoretical insights on capacity, error propagation, and biological learning rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demystify the computational principles behind transformer success by drawing parallels to classical conditioning.

Method: Theoretical framework mapping attention to Pavlovian conditioning, analyzing linear attention for associative memory formation.

Result: Key findings include a capacity theorem, error propagation analysis, and insights into biologically plausible learning rules.

Conclusion: Transformer success may stem from implementing biologically optimized computational principles, not just architectural novelty.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

*Joshua R. Tempelman,Kevin Mitchell,Adam J. Wachtor,Eric B. Flynn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-conditioned generative model for hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification, improving interpretability and reducing reliance on predefined training material sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning frameworks for HSI target identification lack interpretability and are limited by predefined training libraries.

Method: The proposed method uses a probabilistic latent-variable model to learn HSI radiance distributions, employs atmospheric and background conditioning, and incorporates physics-based loss criteria and in-the-loop augmentation.

Result: The model generates emissivity distributions with uncertainty quantification and provides likely material matches, enhancing interpretability and physical consistency.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates contextual HSI scene information, captures material spectrum variations, and offers interpretable probability measures for material identification.

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

TL;DR: DAMP, with MLP-based channel mixing, outperforms DARC in generalization, suggesting robust learning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how MLP-based channel mixing improves generalization in recurrent convolutional networks.

Method: Compare DARC (simple recurrent convolutional) and DAMP (DARC with gated MLP) using the Re-ARC benchmark.

Result: DAMP outperforms DARC in in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: MLP-based channel mixing enhances robustness, making DAMP promising for neural program synthesis and hypernetworks.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks.
Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

*Dinh Triem Phan,Jérôme Bobin,Cheick Thiam,Christophe Bobin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an open-source benchmark for comparing numerical methods in γ-ray spectrometry, evaluating statistical and machine learning approaches across three scenarios. The statistical method outperforms machine learning in identification but is sensitive to signature modeling errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of common benchmarks for evaluating numerical methods in γ-ray spectrometry hinders comparison and progress.

Method: An open-source benchmark with simulated datasets, analysis codes, and metrics is used to compare statistical unmixing and machine learning approaches under three scenarios.

Result: The statistical approach outperforms machine learning in identification but is less robust to modeling errors. Machine learning is viable under uncertain conditions. Quantification is more accurate with the statistical method.

Conclusion: The statistical approach is best for known or well-modeled signatures, while machine learning is a fallback for uncertain conditions. Quantification favors the statistical method.

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

*Zihang Shao,Wentao Lei,Lei Wang,Wencai Ye,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HSA-Net, a novel framework, addresses the global-local trade-off in molecular representation learning by combining cross-attention and Graph-Mamba projectors hierarchically, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer from over-smoothing in deep layers, and existing methods fail to balance global and local feature preservation.

Method: Proposes HSA-Net with Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP) for multi-level feature projection and Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) for adaptive feature merging.

Result: HSA-Net outperforms current SOTA methods in molecular representation learning.

Conclusion: HSA-Net effectively resolves the global-local trade-off, enhancing molecular representation learning.

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Dung T. Tran,Nguyen B. Ha,Van-Dinh Nguyen,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHeRL-FL integrates split learning and hierarchical FL to reduce coordination complexity and communication costs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational heterogeneity and training burden in FL, while reducing communication costs and model aggregation complexity.

Method: Combines split learning and hierarchical model aggregation with representation learning at intermediate layers, enabling independent client and edge server training.

Result: Reduces data transmission by over 90% vs. centralized FL and HierFL, and 50% vs. SplitFed, improving efficiency in IID and non-IID settings.

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL effectively balances computational load and communication efficiency, outperforming existing hybrid FL methods.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

### [55] [Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08350)
*Artem Hnilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine (FPTM), a variant of the Tsetlin Machine with fuzzy clause evaluation, reducing clauses, memory, and training time while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The strict 'all-or-nothing' clause evaluation in Tsetlin Machines requires excessive clauses for accuracy, prompting the need for a more flexible approach.

Method: FPTM employs fuzzy clause evaluation, allowing partial contributions from literals, enabling adaptive sub-patterns and efficient pattern matching.

Result: FPTM achieves significant reductions in clauses (50x), memory, and training time (316x faster) while improving accuracy on datasets like IMDb, Fashion-MNIST, and Amazon Sales.

Conclusion: FPTM offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate alternative to traditional Tsetlin Machines, suitable for resource-constrained environments like microcontrollers.

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper justifies the scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism from first principles, linking it to Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) and revealing its forward pass as an optimal inference step and backward pass as a manifold-aware learning update.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled, mathematical justification for the SDPA mechanism, often motivated heuristically, by connecting it to EOT and reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors frame the SDPA forward pass as solving a degenerate EOT problem and prove its backward pass gradient is equivalent to an advantage-based policy gradient. They analyze the induced information geometry.

Result: The SDPA mechanism is shown to perform optimal inference (forward pass) and implement a rational, geometry-aware learning update (backward pass).

Conclusion: The work unifies SDPA as a principled mechanism, connecting its forward and backward passes to optimal inference and learning, respectively.

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

Motivation: To understand and highlight the advancements in 2D-state RNNs (FWPs), their dynamic weight mechanisms, and their potential connections to natural and artificial intelligence.

Method: Review of FWPs' technical foundations, computational characteristics, and comparisons with transformers and state space models.

Result: FWPs demonstrate dynamic weight programming for short-term memory, with parallels to brain synaptic plasticity and modern architectures like transformers.

Conclusion: FWPs bridge artificial and natural intelligence, offering insights into dynamic memory systems and their broader implications.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: DCCD-CONF is a novel framework for learning nonlinear cyclic causal graphs with unmeasured confounders, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world systems often violate assumptions of fully observed variables and acyclic graphs, especially in fields like biology. Existing methods are limited by linearity assumptions or scalability issues.

Method: DCCD-CONF alternates between optimizing graph structure and estimating confounder distribution using interventional data, maximizing log-likelihood.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in causal graph recovery and confounder identification, validated on synthetic and real-world gene datasets.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, accurate solution for nonlinear cyclic causal discovery with confounders, backed by theoretical consistency guarantees.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

Conclusion: Synergy of deep learning and metaheuristic optimization offers an effective solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and

Result: DiGNNExplainer generates realistic and faithful explanations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DiGNNExplainer addresses the limitations of current HGNN explanation methods, providing better interpretability for heterogeneous graphs.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

### [62] [Sparse Partial Optimal Transport via Quadratic Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08476)
*Khang Tran,Khoa Nguyen,Anh Nguyen,Thong Huynh,Son Pham,Sy-Hoang Nguyen-Dang,Manh Pham,Bang Vo,Mai Ngoc Tran,Mai Ngoc Tran,Dung Luong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quadratic Regularized Partial Optimal Transport (QPOT) as a sparsity-inducing alternative to entropic POT, improving flexibility and performance in applications like color transfer and domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing POT solvers rely on entropic regularization, producing dense transport plans, which limits their use in applications requiring sparsity. QPOT addresses this gap.

Method: The authors propose a novel quadratic regularization for POT, termed QPOT, to induce sparsity in transport plans.

Result: Experiments on synthetic, CIFAR-10, and real-world tasks (e.g., color transfer) show QPOT achieves sparser plans and better performance.

Conclusion: QPOT offers a viable, sparsity-friendly alternative to entropic POT, enhancing its applicability in diverse ML tasks.

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

*Jihyun Lim,Junhyuk Jo,Chanhyeok Ko,Young Min Go,Jimin Hwa,Sunwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a system-aware local SGD method for efficient neural network training in heterogeneous compute environments by workload allocation and controlled bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses inefficiency of synchronous SGD in heterogeneous systems, aiming to utilize all compute resources effectively.

Method: Introduces biased data sampling and model aggregation in local SGD, allocating workloads proportional to compute capacity.

Result: Achieves comparable or higher accuracy than synchronous SGD within the same time budget.

Conclusion: The method is scalable and adaptable to diverse heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

*Guangyin Jin,Sicong Lai,Xiaoshuai Hao,Mingtao Zhang,Jinlei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes M3-Net, a lightweight MLP-based model for traffic prediction, addressing limitations of complex spatio-temporal dependency capture in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for traffic prediction rely on complete network structures or intricate designs, hindering efficient deployment on large-scale datasets.

Method: M3-Net uses time series and spatio-temporal embeddings and introduces an MLP-Mixer with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism.

Result: Experiments on real datasets show M3-Net outperforms in prediction performance and lightweight deployment.

Conclusion: M3-Net offers a cost-effective, efficient solution for traffic prediction without complex dependencies.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

*Dahai Yu,Dingyi Zhuang,Lin Jiang,Rongchao Xu,Xinyue Ye,Yuheng Bu,Shenhao Wang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UQGNN, a Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification, for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction, outperforming existing models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatiotemporal models are deterministic or focus on single phenomena, lacking uncertainty quantification and ignoring correlations among heterogeneous urban phenomena.

Method: UQGNN combines an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module (multivariate diffusion graph convolutional network and temporal convolutional network) and a multivariate probabilistic prediction module.

Result: UQGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 5% improvement in prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification on the Shenzhen dataset.

Conclusion: UQGNN effectively addresses the limitations of existing models by capturing complex interactions and quantifying uncertainty, demonstrating superior performance in real-world datasets.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

*Keumseo Ryum,Jinu Gong,Joonhyuk Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHEFL is a federated learning framework addressing computational heterogeneity by dynamically adjusting resource allocation and introducing a novel aggregation scheme for fairness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods struggle with data/system heterogeneity and fail to fully capture model diversity, limiting communication efficiency and fairness.

Method: SHEFL allocates global models based on client resources, introduces a bias-aware aggregation scheme, and dynamically adjusts resource ratios.

Result: Experiments show SHEFL improves fairness and performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SHEFL effectively handles computational heterogeneity, enhancing FL fairness and overall performance.

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a distributed optimization algorithm for Federated Learning using augmented Lagrangian techniques, adaptable to various communication topologies, with theoretical convergence guarantees and strong performance in heterogeneous settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy-preserving distributed ML collaboration across organizations by accommodating diverse communication topologies and enhancing computational efficiency.

Method: Develops distributed optimization algorithms based on augmented Lagrangian techniques, incorporating proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation, with multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms.

Result: The framework generalizes classical optimization methods (e.g., proximal algorithm, gradient descent) and demonstrates strong performance in large-scale, heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is effective for Federated Learning, offering theoretical convergence guarantees and practical efficiency in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

### [68] [Dynamic Rank Adjustment for Accurate and Efficient Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08625)
*Hyuntak Shin,Aecheon Jung,Sunwoo Lee,Sungeun Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dynamic-rank training framework interleaves full-rank and low-rank training to prevent rank collapse, achieving computational efficiency and accuracy comparable to full-rank training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed low-rank structures hinder learning complex patterns, and rank collapse accelerates during training. Restoring rank strategically can improve performance.

Method: Interleave full-rank training epochs within low-rank training, dynamically adjusting weight matrix ranks to prevent collapse.

Result: Achieves computational efficiency like SVD-based low-rank training while matching full-rank training accuracy across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic-rank framework effectively balances efficiency and performance, mitigating rank collapse issues.

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

### [69] [Classifier Language Models: Unifying Sparse Finetuning and Adaptive Tokenization for Specialized Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08635)
*Adit Krishnan,Chu Wang,Chris Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Token-driven sparse finetuning for small language models outperforms other methods in specialized semantic classification tasks with lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized semantic classification tasks require expert annotations and high throughput, making large models impractical. Smaller, customized models are preferred.

Method: A token-driven sparse finetuning strategy identifies and finetunes a small subset of model parameters using task-specific tokens, avoiding additional parameters.

Result: Outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and prefix tuning on five tasks, with greater stability and half the training costs.

Conclusion: Token-driven sparse finetuning is effective for specialized semantic classification, offering performance and cost benefits.

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

*Peter Phan,Dhruv Agarwal,Kavitha Srinivas,Horst Samulowitz,Pavan Kapanipathi,Andrew McCallum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MiGrATe introduces online test-time training (TTT) for LLMs using GRPO, balancing exploration and exploitation without external data, outperforming baselines in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods struggle to balance exploration and exploitation in black-box optimization, and TTT with synthetic data lacks scalability.

Method: MiGrATe uses GRPO for online TTT, combining on-policy sampling with greedy and neighborhood sampling to bias policy gradients.

Result: MiGrATe outperforms inference-only and TTT baselines in word search, molecule optimization, and program induction tasks.

Conclusion: Online TTT with MiGrATe is effective for complex search tasks without external supervision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces $	ext{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view framework combining molecular structure, task, and rules views, leveraging LLMs for state-of-the-art molecular property prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing molecular representation methods like fingerprints and GNNs ignore semantic and contextual knowledge, while LLMs offer rich reasoning and prior knowledge.

Method: $	ext{M}^{2}$LLM integrates three perspectives (structure, task, rules) dynamically, using LLMs for embeddings and feature curation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks for classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs enhance molecular representation by combining encoding and reasoning, proving effective in $	ext{M}^{2}$LLM.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

*Shibin Su,Guoqiang Liang,De Cheng,Shizhou Zhang,Lingyan Ran,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Global Workspace Model (GWM) enhances ensemble learning in Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) by stabilizing models and improving adaptability under strict memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCIL faces challenges in stability and adaptability under memory constraints, which current replay and ensemble methods struggle to address.

Method: Proposes GWM, a shared implicit memory fusing student model parameters, and a multi-level collaborative distillation mechanism for knowledge alignment.

Result: Significant performance improvement on OCIL benchmarks across various memory budgets.

Conclusion: The method balances stability and plasticity, outperforming existing approaches in OCIL.

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

TL;DR: A novel conditional diffusion model for auto-bidding combines expert trajectory guidance and skip-step sampling, improving efficiency and outperforming baselines by 11.29% in conversions and 12.35% in revenue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional generative bidding lacks personalized structural information and suffers from timeliness risks due to autoregressive generation.

Method: Proposes a conditional diffusion model with expert trajectory guidance and skip-step sampling to enhance decision sequence quality and efficiency.

Result: Offline experiments and online A/B tests show significant improvements: 11.29% higher conversions and 12.35% more revenue.

Conclusion: The method addresses weaknesses in generative bidding, proving effective for auto-bidding with measurable performance gains.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

TL;DR: COGS improves neural TSP solvers' robustness by using generative sampling for training data, outperforming baselines in worst-case scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks for TSP struggle with generalization beyond synthetic data, especially in realistic distributions.

Method: COGS samples training data from a generative TSP model to enhance coverage and interpolation.

Result: COGS shows better distribution robustness, with significant gains in worst-case performance.

Conclusion: COGS addresses generalization issues in neural TSP solvers, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper proves polynomial discretization complexity for rectified flow (RF)-based models in multi-step and one-step generation, outperforming diffusion models and other popular models like VP and VE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theoretical works on RF-based models either focus on stochastic samplers or exhibit exponential complexity. This work aims to provide polynomial complexity results under realistic assumptions.

Method: The study introduces a Langevin process as a corrector in the multi-step setting and analyzes RF-based models to compare them with VP and VE models. It extends findings to one-step RF-based models.

Result: Polynomial discretization complexity is achieved for both multi-step and one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for diffusion models.

Conclusion: This work provides the first theoretical understanding of RF-based models' empirical success, highlighting their superiority over existing models in complexity and performance.

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

*Shuyi Zhang,Wei Shi,Sihang Li,Jiayi Liao,Tao Liang,Hengxing Cai,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SARM integrates a Sparse Autoencoder into reward models for interpretable, flexible, and superior alignment of LLMs with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward models lack interpretability and flexibility, hindering effective alignment of LLM behaviors with human values.

Method: SARM uses a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder to map LLM activations into an interpretable feature space, enabling transparent reward scoring.

Result: SARM provides feature-level attribution, adapts to preference shifts, and outperforms conventional reward models.

Conclusion: SARM offers a promising solution for interpretable and adaptable reward modeling in LLM alignment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

### [77] [Differentiated Information Mining: A Semi-supervised Learning Framework for GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08769)
*Long Wang,Kai Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiFac is a semi-supervised framework for GNNs that derives differentiated factors from a single source, enforces consistency, and integrates auxiliary textual knowledge to improve robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of obtaining mutually independent decision factors in SSL for GNNs, which is difficult due to scarce and non-independent information sources.

Method: DiFac extracts differentiated factors during pre-training, removes conflicting samples, ranks pseudo-labels, and integrates auxiliary textual knowledge with an accountability scoring mechanism.

Result: DiFac outperforms baselines in low-label regimes, enhancing robustness and generalization on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DiFac effectively mitigates pseudo-label bias and training collapse, offering a scalable solution for SSL in GNNs.

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

*Laura Lucaj,Alex Loosley,Hakan Jonsson,Urs Gasser,Patrick van der Smagt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces open-source templates for AI documentation to meet EU AI Act requirements, ensuring traceability, reproducibility, and compliance across the AI lifecycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI documentation templates lack coverage of the full AI lifecycle and compliance with the EU AI Act, necessitating improved solutions.

Method: The authors develop and refine open-source templates for data, models, and applications, validated through user feedback and real-world scenarios.

Result: The templates enhance traceability, reproducibility, and compliance, with successful validation in practical use cases like fairness evaluations and construction safety.

Conclusion: The templates provide a practical tool for regulatory compliance and responsible AI development, aligning with best practices.

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

*Sathiyanaryanan Sampath,Pratyush Uppuluri,Thirumaran Ekambaram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes TempOpt, an unsupervised alarm relation learning technique for telecom networks to improve root alarm identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling the enormous volume of inter-connected alarms in telecom networks is challenging for NOC engineers, requiring better methods to learn alarm relations for accurate root cause analysis.

Method: Introduces Temporal Optimization (TempOpt), a novel unsupervised technique to learn alarm relations, overcoming limitations of temporal dependency methods.

Result: TempOpt demonstrates improved quality of alarm relations compared to existing temporal dependency methods in real-world network datasets.

Conclusion: TempOpt is a practical and effective solution for learning alarm relations, aiding faster and more accurate root alarm identification in telecom networks.

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

*Zheng Zhou,Yu-Jie Xiong,Jia-Chen Zhang,Chun-Ming Xia,Xi-Jiong Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes WaveTS-B and WaveTS-M, lightweight models combining wavelet transforms and MLP for time series forecasting, addressing limitations of Transformers and MLPs. WaveTS-M excels in multi-channel datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies of Transformers (parameter-heavy, poor non-stationary feature capture) and MLPs (weak multi-channel dependency handling) in time series forecasting.

Method: WaveTS-B uses wavelet transforms with MLP for periodic and non-stationary data. WaveTS-M adds channel clustering with MoE framework for multi-channel dependencies.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on eight datasets with fewer parameters. WaveTS-M improves significantly on multi-channel data.

Conclusion: WaveTS models offer efficient, high-performance solutions for time series forecasting, especially for multi-channel data.

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for generating tailored training datasets for generative models and enhancing interpretability in design exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the constraints of large datasets and lack of interpretability in generative machine learning for design.

Method: Systematic framework for dataset construction and integration of generative models with Bayesian optimization.

Result: Validated by designing a flow battery manifold, capturing feasible designs and enabling efficient exploration.

Conclusion: Enhances the applicability of generative models in system design by improving quality and reliability.

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design
representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained
by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of
interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

*Fuyao Zhang,Xinyu Yan,Tiantong Wu,Wenjie Li,Tianxiang Chen,Yang Cao,Ran Yan,Longtao Huang,Wei Yang Bryan Lim,Qiang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Oblivionis is a framework for federated LLM training that integrates unlearning to comply with privacy regulations like GDPR, outperforming local training in balancing forgetting efficacy and model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated LLM frameworks lack mechanisms for regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR's right to be forgotten) and struggle with data quality and governance.

Method: Introduces Oblivionis, a lightweight framework unifying FL and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, incorporating 6 FL and 5 unlearning algorithms.

Result: Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with cross-algorithm comparisons guiding future LLM development.

Conclusion: Oblivionis enhances trustworthiness and regulatory compliance in federated LLM training, providing a robust pipeline for selective data removal.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

*Julian Schönberger,Maximilian Zorn,Jonas Nüßlein,Thomas Gabor,Philipp Altmann*

TL;DR: The paper proposes using genetic algorithms to identify efficient subnetworks (strong lottery tickets) in randomly initialized neural networks, achieving better accuracy and sparsity than current methods without gradient-based training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rethink deep learning paradigms by avoiding overparameterization and expensive training, focusing on scalable, efficient subnetworks.

Method: Genetic algorithms are used to find strong lottery ticket subnetworks in randomly initialized networks, tested on binary and multi-class tasks.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art in accuracy and sparsity without gradient updates, and highlights the need for better evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Genetic algorithms effectively identify strong lottery tickets, offering a scalable alternative to traditional training methods.

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

*Marcin Sendera,Amin Sorkhei,Tomasz Kuśmierczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using trainable activations in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to impose function-space priors, enhancing regularization and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Function-space priors in BNNs offer intuitive belief embedding but are challenging to impose. This work aims to address this challenge.

Method: The study uses optimization techniques with flexible activation models (e.g., Pade functions, piecewise linear functions) to accommodate complex priors.

Result: Empirical results show BNNs with flexible trainable activations can effectively achieve desired function-space priors, even with a single wide hidden layer.

Conclusion: Trainable activations enable BNNs to match intricate target distributions, overcoming challenges like identifiability and symmetries.

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper advocates for synthetic experiments in causal machine learning to rigorously evaluate methods, addressing current shortcomings in empirical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of causal machine learning methods lack reliability and robustness, limiting their practical adoption.

Method: Critically reviews existing evaluation practices and proposes principles for rigorous synthetic data experiments.

Result: Synthetic experiments are deemed essential for precise assessment and understanding of causal machine learning capabilities.

Conclusion: Adopting the proposed principles will enhance trust and broader adoption of causal machine learning methods.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APRNet, a novel deep learning model, improves time series forecasting by decoupling amplitude and phase in frequency domain, enhancing stationary feature capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to explore stationary information from complex frequency components, limiting forecasting accuracy.

Method: APRNet models amplitude-phase inter-relationships, uses a KLC module for adaptive local function fitting, and represents multivariate time series across dimensions.

Result: APRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in capturing time-varying patterns.

Conclusion: APRNet effectively decouples signal characteristics, improving stationary information capture and forecasting performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the vulnerability of class-incremental continual learning models to stage-transferred adversarial attacks, revealing high susceptibility and insufficient defense effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the overlooked security issue of adversarial attacks in continual learning, specifically stage-transferred attacks.

Method: Analyze model vulnerability using adversarial examples from earlier stages to attack later stages, examining model similarity and robustness degradation.

Result: Continual learning methods are highly susceptible to stage-transferred attacks, and existing defenses are inadequate.

Conclusion: The study highlights a critical security flaw in continual learning and calls for improved defense mechanisms against stage-transferred attacks.

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are
available at https://github.com/mcml-official/CSAT.

TL;DR: LNN-PINN improves PINNs' predictive accuracy with a liquid residual gating architecture while maintaining the original physics modeling pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs often lack accuracy in complex problems, prompting the need for architectural refinements.

Method: Introduces a lightweight gating mechanism in hidden-layer mapping without altering other components like sampling or loss.

Result: Reduced RMSE and MAE across benchmarks, with better adaptability and stability.

Conclusion: LNN-PINN is a concise, effective enhancement for PINNs in complex scientific and engineering tasks.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering
problems.

TL;DR: GenCast is a model for traffic forecasting in regions without sensors, using external knowledge and physics-informed neural networks to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic forecasting is crucial, but sensor data is often unavailable in some regions, limiting existing models' generalisability.

Method: GenCast integrates physics-informed neural networks, an external signal learning module, and a spatial grouping module to enhance forecasting.

Result: GenCast reduces forecasting errors across multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GenCast effectively addresses the challenge of forecasting in sensor-less regions by leveraging external knowledge and physical principles.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

TL;DR: GRAVITY introduces a dynamic, physics-inspired framework for vertex classification, leveraging learned interactions and adaptive receptive fields to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance vertex classification by modeling vertices as interacting objects in a potential field, dynamically adjusting interactions for better class separation.

Method: GRAVITY models vertices as exerting influence via learned interactions based on structural proximity and attribute similarity, creating a latent potential field for dynamic aggregation.

Result: GRAVITY achieves competitive performance in transductive and inductive vertex classification tasks, sharpening class boundaries.

Conclusion: GRAVITY's physics-inspired approach effectively improves vertex classification by dynamically organizing vertices in a latent potential field.

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a frequency-domain-based adversarial attack method for time series forecasting, showing current models' vulnerability to such attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in Transformer-based time series forecasting, adversarial robustness remains understudied, especially regarding frequency-domain features.

Method: Adapts a classification attack method to prediction tasks, optimizing adversarial samples with time and frequency-domain losses.

Result: Demonstrates current models' susceptibility to adversarial attacks, with the proposed method performing well on major datasets.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for adversarial robustness in time series forecasting and introduces a novel frequency-domain attack approach.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using attention weights in transformers to enhance explainable AI (XAI) methods, proposing two novel techniques for local and global explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention weights in transformers offer interpretable signals, but their potential for enriching XAI frameworks is underexplored.

Method: Two methods are developed: 1) integrating attention weights into Shapley values for local explanations, and 2) using attention weights with concept activation vectors for global explanations.

Result: Empirical evaluations show attention weights meaningfully enrich XAI frameworks, improving transformer explainability.

Conclusion: Attention weights can effectively complement XAI techniques, enhancing interpretability in transformer models.

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL) for edge intelligence systems, proposing two policies (HI-LCB and HI-LCB-lite) that achieve order-optimal regret and outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage in edge intelligence systems by optimizing when to offload inference tasks from local to remote models.

Method: Model the probability of correct local inference as a function of confidence, and propose HI-LCB and HI-LCB-lite policies based on the UCB framework.

Result: Both policies achieve $O(\log T)$ regret, outperforming existing methods with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret. HI-LCB-lite has $O(1)$ computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed policies are effective and efficient, making them suitable for resource-limited devices, as confirmed by real-world simulations.

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of designing mechanical mechanisms for specific paths is complex due to vast search spaces of topologies and parameters.

Method: MechaFormer treats mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task, learning to generate DSL strings for topology and parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy, generates diverse valid designs, and improves solution quality with sampling strategies.

Conclusion: MechaFormer's outputs enhance traditional optimizers, forming a hybrid approach for efficient, superior solutions.

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet
notoriously difficult engineering problem, characterized by a vast and complex
search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce
MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating
mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to
translate a target curve into a domain-specific language (DSL) string,
simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in
a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve intrusion detection performance by leveraging feature embedding and federated learning for privacy and localized performance.

Method: Develops FetFIDS, a transformer-based model using feature embedding, designed for federated learning scenarios.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems in federated environments.

Conclusion: FetFIDS is highly suitable for federated learning and effective for intrusion detection.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have an increasingly important role in
preventing exploitation of network vulnerabilities by malicious actors. Recent
deep learning based developments have resulted in significant improvements in
the performance of IDS systems. In this paper, we present FetFIDS, where we
explore the employment of feature embedding instead of positional embedding to
improve intrusion detection performance of a transformer based deep learning
system. Our model is developed with the aim of deployments in edge learning
scenarios, where federated learning over multiple communication rounds can
ensure both privacy and localized performance improvements. FetFIDS outperforms
multiple state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems in a federated
environment and demonstrates a high degree of suitability to federated
learning. The code for this work can be found at

*Jonas Valbjørn Andersena,Anders Peder Højer Karlsen,Markus Harboe Olsen,Nikolaj Krebs Pedersen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OPIAID is a machine learning algorithm for personalized opioid dosage prediction, optimizing pain management while reducing adverse events using EHR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve pain management by predicting personalized opioid dosages and minimizing opioid-related adverse events (ORADE).

Method: Uses causal machine learning trained on EHR data to analyze relationships between dose, patient characteristics, and outcomes.

Result: Provides personalized opioid dose recommendations based on patient-specific factors and opiate types.

Conclusion: OPIAID offers a promising approach for tailored pain management with reduced adverse effects.

Abstract: This paper introduces the OPIAID algorithm, a novel approach for predicting
and recommending personalized opioid dosages for individual patients. The
algorithm optimizes pain management while minimizing opioid related adverse
events (ORADE) by employing machine learning models trained on observational
electronic health records (EHR) data. It leverages a causal machine learning
approach to understand the relationship between opioid dose, case specific
patient and intraoperative characteristics, and pain versus ORADE outcomes. The
OPIAID algorithm considers patient-specific characteristics and the influence
of different opiates, enabling personalized dose recommendations. This paper
outlines the algorithm's methodology and architecture, and discusses key
assumptions, and approaches to evaluating its performance.

*Bisman Singh,Lucy Van Kleunen,Aaron Clauset*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper systematically evaluates link prediction methods for incomplete relational data, comparing model stacking, neural networks, and topological predictors. It finds no single best method, introduces a meta-learning algorithm for optimal performance, and highlights the impact of network characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the best link prediction approach for incomplete networks without node attributes and understand how network characteristics influence algorithm performance.

Method: A large benchmark of 550 real-world networks was used to compare four stacking algorithms, 42 topological predictors (including two new ones), and two graph neural networks under AUC and Top-k accuracy measures.

Result: No single algorithm performs best across all networks. Model stacking with random forest is highly scalable and competitive with graph neural networks. Performance depends on network traits like degree distribution and triangle density.

Conclusion: A meta-learning algorithm is introduced to select the best method for individual networks, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches and scaling well.

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

*Gabrielle Berrada,Jannik Kossen,Muhammed Razzak,Freddie Bickford Smith,Yarin Gal,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active testing scales efficiently for large language models (LLMs) using cheap surrogate models and in-context learning, reducing data needs and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational costs of active testing for large models, making it feasible for LLM evaluation.

Method: Use in-context learning to create cheap surrogate models, avoid updating them during active testing, and introduce a single-run error estimator.

Result: Effective LLM performance evaluation with less data and lower computational costs compared to standard practices.

Conclusion: Active testing can be efficiently scaled for LLMs, improving evaluation efficiency and reducing resource demands.

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

*Rylie Weaver,Massamiliano Lupo Pasini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chi-Geometry is a library for generating synthetic graph data to test GNNs' chirality prediction, enabling interpretable benchmarking and guiding new GNN designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a tool for generating synthetic graph data with controlled traits to benchmark GNNs' ability to predict chirality without confounding factors.

Method: Generates synthetic graphs with user-specified geometric/topological traits and randomized node positions/species, labeled for chirality (R/S or N/A).

Result: Demonstrated efficacy by benchmarking SOTA GNNs, leading to two new architectures: one with all-to-all connections (high accuracy, high cost) and another with a virtual node (competitive accuracy, linear cost).

Conclusion: Chi-Geometry enables better benchmarking and inspires new GNN designs, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency for chirality prediction.

Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing
and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates
synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA
GNN architectures.

*Tianyun Yang,Yunwen Li,Ziniu Li,Zhihang Lin,Ruoyu Sun,Tian Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GF-Reasoner, a model combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with formal language to improve Geometry Problem Solving (GPS), achieving 15% higher accuracy than peers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models struggle with GPS due to unreliable diagram interpretation and lack of intermediate reasoning. Symbolic solvers alone lack transparency.

Method: Integrates CoT with formal language, interleaving natural language reasoning with solver-executable code. Uses supervised fine-tuning on a synthetic dataset and solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning.

Result: GF-Reasoner outperforms peers, including larger models, with shorter, cleaner reasoning traces.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach enhances GPS accuracy and transparency, with insights on design choices for future research.

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

*Shreyas Bhat Brahmavar,Yang Li,Junier Oliva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASPIRE is a universal neural model for reasoning over heterogeneous structured data, using a set-based Transformer and semantic grounding to align features and make predictions without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data is diverse and disjoint, making it hard to build general-purpose models that work across datasets.

Method: ASPIRE combines a permutation-invariant Transformer with a semantic grounding module, using natural language, metadata, and examples to align features and make predictions.

Result: ASPIRE achieves strong performance across benchmarks and supports cost-aware feature acquisition under budget constraints.

Conclusion: ASPIRE advances universal, semantics-aware inference for structured data.

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

*Jiani Ni,He Zhao,Yibo Yang,Dandan Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MaC-Cal is a mask-based classifier calibration method using stochastic sparsity to improve DNN confidence alignment with accuracy, addressing underconfidence issues and enhancing robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor calibration in DNNs, especially in safety-critical fields like autonomous driving and healthcare, can lead to unreliable confidence estimates with serious consequences. Existing methods often overlook underconfidence errors.

Method: MaC-Cal employs a two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask retention rates based on confidence-accuracy deviation.

Result: MaC-Cal outperforms in calibration performance and robustness under data corruption.

Conclusion: MaC-Cal provides a practical and effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

TL;DR: A novel zero-shot framework (CARES) and dataset (MERP) for detecting surgical errors in robotic prostatectomy, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical error detection methods lack sufficient training data and struggle with methodological constraints, especially in robotic-assisted surgery (RAS).

Method: CARES uses adaptive, error-specific Chain-of-Thought prompts and risk-aware routing to assign tasks to expertise-matched reasoning pathways. It decomposes analysis into temporal, spatial, and procedural agents.

Result: CARES achieves 54.3 mF1 on RARP and 52.0 mF1 on MERP, outperforming zero-shot methods by up to 14% and matching trained models.

Conclusion: CARES and MERP provide a robust, zero-shot solution for surgical error detection, with publicly available dataset and code.

Abstract: Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) introduces complex challenges that current
surgical error detection methods struggle to address effectively due to limited
training data and methodological constraints. Therefore, we construct MERP
(Multi-class Error in Robotic Prostatectomy), a comprehensive dataset for error
detection in robotic prostatectomy with frame-level annotations featuring six
clinically aligned error categories. In addition, we propose CARES
(Collaborative Agentic Reasoning for Error Detection in Surgery), a novel
zero-shot clinically-informed and risk-stratified agentic reasoning
architecture for multi-class surgical error detection. CARES implements
adaptive generation of medically informed, error-specific Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompts across multiple expertise levels. The framework employs
risk-aware routing to assign error task to expertise-matched reasoning pathways
based on complexity and clinical impact. Subsequently, each pathway decomposes
surgical error analysis into three specialized agents with temporal, spatial,
and procedural analysis. Each agent analyzes using dynamically selected prompts
tailored to the assigned expertise level and error type, generating detailed
and transparent reasoning traces. By incorporating clinically informed
reasoning from established surgical assessment guidelines, CARES enables
zero-shot surgical error detection without prior training. Evaluation
demonstrates superior performance with 54.3 mF1 on RARP and 52.0 mF1 on MERP
datasets, outperforming existing zero-shot approaches by up to 14% while
remaining competitive with trained models. Ablation studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: MARTA is a framework for training MARL agents to handle agent failures by learning resilient policies through adversarial training with a malfunction budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring MARL policies remain effective despite inevitable agent failures in real-world deployments.

Method: Uses an adversarial Markov game with a malfunction budget, where an adversary disables agents in high-risk states, and agents learn joint responses.

Result: Theoretically converges to a Markov perfect equilibrium; empirically outperforms benchmarks in fault tolerance.

Conclusion: MARTA provides a robust, practical solution for fault-tolerant MARL policies.

Abstract: In multi-agent systems, the safe and reliable execution of tasks often
depends on agents correctly coordinating their actions. However, in real-world
deployments, failures of computational components are inevitable, presenting a
critical challenge: ensuring that multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
policies remain effective even when some agents malfunction. We propose the
Multi-Agent Robust Training Algorithm (MARTA), a plug-and-play framework for
training MARL agents to be resilient to potentially severe faults. MARTA
operates in cooperative multi-agent settings where agents may lose the ability
to execute their intended actions. It learns to identify failure scenarios that
are especially detrimental to system performance and equips agents with
strategies to mitigate their impact. At the heart of MARTA is a novel
adversarial Markov game in which an adversary -- modelled via \emph{Markov
switching controls} -- learns to disable agents in high-risk state regions,
while the remaining agents are trained to \emph{jointly} best-respond to such
targeted malfunctions. To ensure practicality, MARTA enforces a malfunction
budget, constraining the adversary to a fixed number of failures and learning
robust policies accordingly. We provide theoretical guarantees that MARTA
converges to a Markov perfect equilibrium, ensuring agents optimally counteract
worst-case faults. Empirically, we show that MARTA achieves state-of-the-art
fault-tolerant performance across benchmark environments, including Multi-Agent
Particle World and Level-Based Foraging.
