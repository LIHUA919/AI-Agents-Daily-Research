User events can be broadly categorized into\npersonal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which\ninvolve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically\nmodeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and\ngraph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both\nevent types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them\ntogether. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior\ncan be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence\nor a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and\nprediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational\nevents. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a\nunified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from\nincorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods\nleave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support\nfurther research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this\ndirection."}

To resolve this dichotomy, we\nintroduce \\textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that\nachieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.\nGrounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion\ndynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear\noperators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions.

This availability has\nmotivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.\n  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional\ntraining, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically\nactivate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy\nor insufficiency that degrade performance.\n  In this paper, we propose \\texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that\nperforms adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural\nproperties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank\nparameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,\n\\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their\nROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the\ntoken level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative\nROCs.\n  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \\texttt{HiLoRA} selects the\nmost relevant LoRAs with high probability.\n  Extensive experiments show that \\texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial\nimprovements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\\small\n$55\\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference\nthroughput."}

This is a critical\nlimitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining\ntemporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose\nTime-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to\ntime-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models\ninter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating\ntemporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to\nclassical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three\nvideo-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video\nsuper-resolution.

Given that time series data can exhibit different\npatterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven\nbeneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a\nsingle scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information\nindependently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the\ndynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.\nMoreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding\nwindows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual\ninformation. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time\nseries Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window\nmodeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that\nreconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing\ncross-scale associations.

Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined\nproblems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously\nfitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these\ntasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce\ndynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging\nthe recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained\nmodels that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,\nthe drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot\nmode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen\nweights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,\nsimulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning.

These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are\nspecifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL\ndivergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the\nL0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes.

Existing algorithms for\nachieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods\nthat optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain\nomniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based\napproaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case\" loss in an online\nfashion.
