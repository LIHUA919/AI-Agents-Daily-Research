### [1] [ExaCraft: Dynamic Learning Context Adaptation for Personalized Educational Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09931)
*Akaash Chatterjee,Suman Kundu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ExaCraft is an AI system that generates personalized learning examples by adapting to learners' dynamic context through user profiles and real-time behavior analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing educational AI tools lack focus on generating adaptive examples that respond to learners' changing understanding and needs.

Method: Uses Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API via Chrome extension, combining user profiles with real-time learner behavior analysis.

Result: Developed a system that adapts to five key learning context aspects (struggle indicators, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals).

Conclusion: ExaCraft demonstrates evolving examples from basic to advanced concepts, responding to various learning patterns and use cases.

Abstract: Learning is most effective when it's connected to relevant, relatable examples that resonate with learners on a personal level. However, existing educational AI tools don't focus on generating examples or adapting to learners' changing understanding, struggles, or growing skills. We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals. Our demonstration will show how ExaCraft's examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns in different use cases.

*Maya Grace Torii,Takahito Murakami,Shuka Koseki,Yoichi Ochiai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Suzume-chan, an embodied AI agent using RAG to create warmer knowledge sharing through physical presence and dialogue


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital tools lack the sense of connection needed for deep understanding despite improving information access

Method: Developed Suzume-chan prototype - a soft AI agent using Social Presence Theory, running locally with language model and RAG

Result: Reduces psychological distance through spoken explanations and conversational interaction

Conclusion: Embodied Information Hubs can make knowledge sharing more human-centered by creating stronger social presence

Abstract: Access to expert knowledge often requires real-time human communication. Digital tools improve access to information but rarely create the sense of connection needed for deep understanding. This study addresses this issue using Social Presence Theory, which explains how a feeling of "being together" enhances communication. An "Embodied Information Hub" is proposed as a new way to share knowledge through physical and conversational interaction. The prototype, Suzume-chan, is a small, soft AI agent running locally with a language model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It learns from spoken explanations and responds through dialogue, reducing psychological distance and making knowledge sharing warmer and more human-centered.

### [3] [Exploring Health Misinformation Detection with Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09935)
*Chih-Han Chen,Chen-Han Tsai,Yu-Shao Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two-stage framework combining agreement scoring and multi-agent debate improves health misinformation detection


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health misinformation proliferation online requires effective verification through both evidence retrieval and rigorous reasoning

Method: Stage 1: LLMs evaluate retrieved articles to compute aggregated agreement score. Stage 2: If consensus low, multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence

Result: Superior performance compared to baseline methods

Conclusion: Combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning adds value for complex verification tasks

Abstract: Fact-checking health-related claims has become increasingly critical as misinformation proliferates online. Effective verification requires both the retrieval of high-quality evidence and rigorous reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for health misinformation detection: Agreement Score Prediction followed by Multi-Agent Debate. In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance. When this score indicates insufficient consensus-falling below a predefined threshold-the system proceeds to a second stage. Multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence and generate well-reasoned verdicts with explicit justifications. Experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the value of combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning for complex verification tasks.

### [4] [Echo-CoPilot: A Multi-View, Multi-Task Agent for Echocardiography Interpretation and Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09944)
*Moein Heidari,Mohammad Amin Roohi,Armin Khosravi,Ilker Hacihaliloglu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Echo-CoPilot is a multi-view, multi-task AI agent that uses LLM orchestration and specialized echocardiography tools to automate comprehensive echocardiogram interpretation, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current echocardiography interpretation is manual and cognitively demanding, while existing foundation models operate in isolation without providing unified clinical assessments.

Method: Develop a ReAct-style agent that decomposes clinician queries, invokes specialized tools for view recognition, segmentation, measurement, disease prediction, and report synthesis, then integrates outputs into guideline-aware answers.

Result: Achieved 50.8% accuracy on MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models, with qualitative success in borderline clinical cases.

Conclusion: Echo-CoPilot demonstrates effective unification of specialized tools through LLM orchestration for comprehensive echocardiography interpretation, with potential to augment clinical workflow.

Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

*Sha Li,Ayush Sadekar,Nathan Self,Yiqi Su,Lars Andersland,Mira Chaplin,Annabel Zhang,Hyoju Yang,James B Henderson,Krista Wigginton,Linsey Marr,T. M. Murali,Naren Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciEx is a modular framework that addresses LLM limitations in scientific literature extraction by decoupling parsing, retrieval, extraction, and aggregation components for better accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based tools struggle with scientific literature's challenges: long-context documents, multi-modal content, inconsistent information across publications, and rapidly changing data schemas, making re-architecting existing systems difficult.

Method: SciEx employs a modular framework that decouples key components like PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation, designed to be extensible with new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms.

Result: The framework was evaluated on three scientific topics and showed ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently, providing practical insights into LLM-based scientific information extraction.

Conclusion: SciEx demonstrates that a modular, decoupled framework can effectively address the limitations of current LLM-based extraction pipelines for scientific literature, while also revealing both strengths and limitations of current approaches in handling complex scientific data extraction at scale.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly touted as powerful tools for automating scientific information extraction. However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. We evaluate SciEx on datasets spanning three scientific topics for its ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently. Our findings provide practical insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM-based pipelines.

### [7] [DynaMate: An Autonomous Agent for Protein-Ligand Molecular Dynamics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10034)
*Salomé Guilbert,Cassandra Masschelein,Jeremy Goumaz,Bohdan Naida,Philippe Schwaller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DynaMate is a multi-agent framework that automates molecular dynamics simulations for proteins and protein-ligand systems, enabling error correction and binding affinity calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplify the technical complexity of MD setup (parameterization, input preparation, software configuration) to make MD simulations more accessible for drug discovery and protein engineering.

Method: A modular multi-agent framework with three specialized modules for experiment planning, simulation execution, and result analysis, integrating dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and self-correction.

Result: Successfully performed full MD simulations across twelve benchmark systems, corrected runtime errors iteratively, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions.

Conclusion: DynaMate automates and standardizes MD workflows, paving the way for scalable, time-efficient molecular modeling in biomolecular and drug design applications.

Abstract: Force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are indispensable for probing the structure, dynamics, and functions of biomolecular systems, including proteins and protein-ligand complexes. Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results. We evaluated its performance across twelve benchmark systems of varying complexity, assessing success rate, efficiency, and adaptability. DynaMate reliably performed full MD simulations, corrected runtime errors through iterative reasoning, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions. This automated framework paves the way toward standardized, scalable, and time-efficient molecular modeling pipelines for future biomolecular and drug design applications.

*Yan Zhuang,Jiawei Ren,Xiaokang Ye,Jianzhi Shen,Ruixuan Zhang,Tianai Yue,Muhammad Faayez,Xuhong He,Ziqiao Ma,Lianhui Qin,Zhiting Hu,Tianmin Shu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SWR is a photorealistic urban simulation platform with multi-robot support, featuring two challenging benchmarks that expose limitations in current AI models for robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotics research focuses on indoor scenarios, lacking realistic urban environments needed for developing generalist robots capable of handling complex outdoor tasks.

Method: Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes with dynamic elements like pedestrians and traffic systems, supporting multi-robot control and communication.

Result: Two benchmarks were created: multimodal instruction-following navigation and multi-agent search tasks, where state-of-the-art models struggle significantly.

Conclusion: Current AI models lack the robust perception, reasoning, and planning capabilities required for realistic urban robotics tasks, highlighting the need for more advanced solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown promising results in developing generalist robotics that can perform diverse tasks in open-ended scenarios given multimodal inputs. However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including vision-language models (VLMs), struggle with our tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities necessary for urban environments.

### [9] [Parallel Decoder Transformer: Model-Internal Parallel Decoding with Speculative Invariance via Note Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10054)
*Logan Robbins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PDT introduces parallel decoder transformer with speculative note conditioning to enable parallel decoding in frozen LLMs, achieving 77.8% precision in coverage prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in LLMs creates latency bottleneck; existing parallel methods suffer from coherence drift due to lack of cross-stream communication.

Method: PDT uses lightweight SNC adapters to allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via shared latent space, formulating coordination as speculative consensus problem.

Result: Achieves 77.8% precision in coverage prediction and recovers approximate serial semantics without modifying base model weights.

Conclusion: PDT establishes scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) is inherently sequential, creating a latency bottleneck that scales linearly with output length. While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.
  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \textbf{77.8\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights. This establishes PDT as a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation.

### [10] [Mind the Gap! Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10058)
*Dani Roytburg,Beck Miller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a significant structural divide between AI safety and AI ethics research communities, showing minimal collaboration and reliance on a few key bridging papers for cross-disciplinary exchange.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that the conceptual disagreement about AI alignment between safety (focused on existential risks) and ethics (focused on current harms) is reflected in institutional and collaborative structures, hindering integrated progress.

Method: Conducted a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025) to measure collaboration patterns and connectivity between safety and ethics research.

Result: Over 80% of collaborations occur within either safety or ethics communities; cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated (5% of papers account for over 85% of bridging links). Removing key brokers sharply increases segregation.

Conclusion: Integration of technical safety with normative ethics through shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed methods is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.

Abstract: While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, "aligned" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.
  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.

### [11] [Linear socio-demographic representations emerge in Large Language Models from indirect cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10065)
*Paul Bouchaud,Pedro Ramaciotti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs form linear demographic representations from names/occupations with stereotypical directions, influencing model behavior despite passing bias tests; poses fairness risks at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners from indirect cues like names and occupations, and understand how these representations influence model behavior and fairness.

Method: Probing residual streams across layers of four transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) using explicit demographic disclosure, then testing on implicit cues (names and occupations), using linear representations to explain demographic inferences.

Result: LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics where stereotypical attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions; (1) probes trained on explicit disclosures predict demographics from implicit cues; (2) names activate census-aligned gender/race representations; (3) occupations trigger workforce-statistics-correlated representations; (4) these representations shape downstream behaviors (e.g., career recommendations).

Conclusion: Even models that pass standard bias benchmarks can still harbor and leverage implicit demographic biases, with significant fairness implications for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: We investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners inferred from indirect cues such as names and occupations. We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale.

### [12] [Interpretable Embeddings with Sparse Autoencoders: A Data Analysis Toolkit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10092)
*Nick Jiang,Xiaoqing Sun,Lisa Dunlap,Lewis Smith,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAE embeddings offer cost-effective, controllable alternative to LLMs/dense embeddings for text corpus analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing large-scale text corpora rely on costly LLM-based techniques or dense embedding models, which lack control over properties of interest.

Method: Propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: interpretable concept-based representations.

Result: SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs, more controllable than dense embeddings. Enable insights like semantic dataset differences and concept correlations. Case studies show practical applications.

Conclusion: SAEs position as versatile tools for unstructured data analysis, highlighting importance of interpreting models through their data.

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale text corpora is a core challenge in machine learning, crucial for tasks like identifying undesirable model behaviors or biases in training data. Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding "trigger" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data.

*Soorya Ram Shimgekar,Abhay Goyal,Lam Yin Cheung,Roy Ka-Wei Lee,Koustuv Saha,Pi Zonooz,Navin Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers developed a computational framework to analyze conspiratorial narratives in Singapore Telegram groups, finding they integrate into everyday discussions across multiple topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conspiratorial discourse is embedded in digital communication but difficult to study systematically.

Method: Two-stage framework: fine-tuned RoBERTa-large for conspiracy classification (F1=0.866), then built signed belief graphs and developed SiBeGNN with Sign Disentanglement Loss for embeddings.

Result: Identified 7 narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages; SiBeGNN achieved superior clustering (cDBI=8.38) vs baselines (13.60-67.27) with 88% expert agreement.

Conclusion: Conspiratorial messages permeate routine discussions, challenging assumptions about online radicalization; framework advances belief-driven discourse analysis.

Abstract: Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.
  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.

*Mesafint Fanuel,Mahmoud Nabil Mahmoud,Crystal Cook Marshal,Vishal Lakhotia,Biswanath Dari,Kaushik Roy,Shaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgriRegion is a specialized RAG system for agriculture that uses geospatial constraints and local knowledge to provide accurate region-specific advice, reducing contextual hallucinations by 10-20% compared to standard LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have potential for democratizing agricultural information access, but suffer from contextual hallucinations where they provide non-factual or regionally inappropriate advice due to variations in soil, climate, and local regulations. Standard approaches fail to account for geographical specificity required in agricultural advisory.

Method: This paper introduces AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. The framework includes a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism, going beyond standard semantic similarity approaches. It restricts the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforces geo-spatial constraints during retrieval to ensure local accuracy.

Result: The authors demonstrate that AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLM systems and significantly improves trust scores according to comprehensive evaluation using their novel AgriRegion-Eval benchmark dataset of 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields.

Conclusion: The proposed AgriRegion framework provides an effective solution to the problem of contextual hallucinations in LLMs for agriculture, delivering region-specific, trustworthy advice by integrating geospatial constraints and verified knowledge sources. This approach substantially enhances the reliability of AI-driven agricultural advisory systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in democratizing access to information. However, in the domain of agriculture, general-purpose models frequently suffer from contextual hallucination, which provides non-factual advice or answers are scientifically sound in one region but disastrous in another due to variations in soil, climate, and local regulations. We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields. Experiments demonstrate that AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLMs systems and significantly improves trust scores according to a comprehensive evaluation.

*Alexander Wan,Kevin Klyman,Sayash Kapoor,Nestor Maslej,Shayne Longpre,Betty Xiong,Percy Liang,Rishi Bommasani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index shows a significant decline in transparency (average score dropped from 58 to 40/100), with companies being most opaque about training data/compute and model impacts. IBM is best (95), while xAI and Midjourney are worst (14). Policy interventions may be needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how transparency practices of foundation model developers are evolving as these companies become increasingly important, and to assess the impact of new transparency indicators and policies.

Method: Annual index evaluation using updated indicators (including new ones for data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring) to score companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time.

Result: Transparency progress has deteriorated significantly, with average score dropping from 58 (2024) to 40 (2025). Companies are most opaque about training data, compute, and post-deployment impacts. IBM scored highest (95), while xAI and Midjourney scored lowest (14).

Conclusion: Foundation model transparency has worsened despite growing policy mandates. More aggressive policy interventions are needed to address critical information gaps, as current voluntary measures are insufficient.

Abstract: Foundation model developers are among the world's most important companies. As these companies become increasingly consequential, how do their transparency practices evolve? The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index is the third edition of an annual effort to characterize and quantify the transparency of foundation model developers. The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders. As policymakers around the world increasingly mandate certain types of transparency, this work reveals the current state of transparency for foundation model developers, how it may change given newly enacted policy, and where more aggressive policy interventions are necessary to address critical information deficits.

TL;DR: CP-Env is a controllable agentic hospital environment for evaluating LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways, addressing limitations of current benchmarks that focus on static exams or isolated dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks inadequately evaluate LLMs in dynamic clinical scenarios, which involve complex decision-making and transitions between different stages of medical care.

Method: CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, constructing scenarios from triage to multidisciplinary team meetings, enabling branching and long-horizon task execution following real hospital adaptive flow.

Result: Most models struggle with pathway complexity, exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details. Excessive reasoning steps can be counterproductive, while top models show reduced tool dependency through internalized knowledge.

Conclusion: CP-Env advances medical AI agents development through comprehensive end-to-end clinical evaluation, with benchmark and tools provided for further research.

Abstract: Medical care follows complex clinical pathways that extend beyond isolated physician-patient encounters, emphasizing decision-making and transitions between different stages. Current benchmarks focusing on static exams or isolated dialogues inadequately evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical scenarios. We introduce CP-Env, a controllable agentic hospital environment designed to evaluate LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways. CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, constructing scenarios ranging from triage and specialist consultation to diagnostic testing and multidisciplinary team meetings for agent interaction. Following real hospital adaptive flow of healthcare, it enables branching, long-horizon task execution. We propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, and Professional Ethics. Results reveal that most models struggle with pathway complexity, exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details. Interestingly, excessive reasoning steps can sometimes prove counterproductive, while top models tend to exhibit reduced tool dependency through internalized knowledge. CP-Env advances medical AI agents development through comprehensive end-to-end clinical evaluation. We provide the benchmark and evaluation tools for further research and development at https://github.com/SPIRAL-MED/CP-Env.

### [18] [An exploration for higher efficiency in multi objective optimisation with reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10208)
*Mehmet Emin Aydin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposal of a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach to optimize operator sequences in search algorithms, addressing a gap in multi-objective optimization literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiency challenges in optimization algorithms due to suboptimal operator sequences; limited research on multi-objective cases despite prior work on single-objective optimization.

Method: Generalization approach using multi-objective reinforcement learning to learn from experiences and determine effective operator sequences.

Result: The approach is outlined as promising but partially developed, with some stages completed and others remaining for future work.

Conclusion: Multi-objective reinforcement learning shows potential to enhance optimization efficiency, though further implementation and validation are needed.

Abstract: Efficiency in optimisation and search processes persists to be one of the challenges, which affects the performance and use of optimisation algorithms. Utilising a pool of operators instead of a single operator to handle move operations within a neighbourhood remains promising, but an optimum or near optimum sequence of operators necessitates further investigation. One of the promising ideas is to generalise experiences and seek how to utilise it. Although numerous works are done around this issue for single objective optimisation, multi-objective cases have not much been touched in this regard. A generalised approach based on multi-objective reinforcement learning approach seems to create remedy for this issue and offer good solutions. This paper overviews a generalisation approach proposed with certain stages completed and phases outstanding that is aimed to help demonstrate the efficiency of using multi-objective reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends Predict-and-Search framework to parametric mixed-integer programs with identity-aware learning for better handling of heterogeneous variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Predict-and-Search methods are limited to binary problems and ignore fixed variables commonly found in practical applications.

Method: Proposes ID-PaS framework that incorporates identity-aware machine learning to handle heterogeneous variables in parametric MIPs.

Result: ID-PaS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and original PaS framework on real-world large-scale problems.

Conclusion: The identity-aware learning approach successfully extends Predict-and-Search methods to more practical mixed-integer optimization problems.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MIPs) are powerful and flexible tools for modeling a wide range of real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Predict-and-Search methods operate by using a predictive model to estimate promising variable assignments and then guiding a search procedure toward high-quality solutions. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating machine learning (ML) into the Predict-and-Search framework significantly enhances its performance. Still, it is restricted to binary problems and overlooks the presence of fixed variables that commonly arise in practical settings. This work extends the Predict-and-Search (PaS) framework to parametric MIPs and introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enables the ML model to handle heterogeneous variables more effectively. Experiments on several real-world large-scale problems demonstrate that ID-PaS consistently achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and PaS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel reverse thinking framework improves LLMs' ability to detect missing information by transforming it into backward reasoning, outperforming traditional forward methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with missing information, leading to incomplete responses and errors. Forward reasoning methods like CoT and ToT fail to systematically recover omitted details.

Method: Proposes a reverse thinking framework that guides LLMs through backward reasoning to identify necessary conditions and missing elements.

Result: Experimental results show substantial performance gains over traditional forward reasoning methods.

Conclusion: Reverse thinking enhances LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness, offering a promising direction for handling missing information.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various reasoning tasks, yet they often struggle with problems involving missing information, exhibiting issues such as incomplete responses, factual errors, and hallucinations. While forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) have shown success in structured problem-solving, they frequently fail to systematically identify and recover omitted information. In this paper, we explore the potential of reverse thinking methodologies to enhance LLMs' performance on missing information detection tasks. Drawing inspiration from recent work on backward reasoning, we propose a novel framework that guides LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements. Our approach transforms the challenging task of missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem, significantly improving model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our reverse thinking approach achieves substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods, providing a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness.

*Waleed Razzaq,Izis Kankaraway,Yun-Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NAC introduces a biologically plausible continuous-time attention mechanism derived from C. elegans neuronal circuits, offering three computation modes and sparse interactions while maintaining theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention mechanisms improve RNN representation learning but cannot handle continuous-time modeling due to discrete nature.

Method: Reformulates attention computation as ODE solution using sparse gates derived from neuronal circuits, with three computation modes and selective Top-K interactions.

Result: NAC matches or outperforms baselines in accuracy across irregular time-series, autonomous driving, and industrial applications.

Conclusion: NAC successfully bridges discrete attention with continuous-time modeling while maintaining efficiency and biological plausibility.

Abstract: Attention improves representation learning over RNNs, but its discrete nature limits continuous-time (CT) modeling. We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically plausible CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing \textit{C. elegans} Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring mechanism. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \textit{content-target} and \textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared with several CT baselines.

TL;DR: A framework for analyzing VLMs' internal mechanisms focusing on attention heads' functional roles in multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite VLMs' strong performance on benchmarks, they remain largely uninterpretable black boxes.

Method: Proposed CogVision dataset with step-by-step subquestions to probe attention heads' functions using chain-of-thought paradigm.

Result: Identified sparse functional heads across VLM families that mediate hierarchical organization and are critical for multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: Findings provide insights for designing more human-aligned VLMs with better interpretability.

Abstract: Despite excelling on multimodal benchmarks, vision-language models (VLMs) largely remain a black box. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.

TL;DR: Framework for trustworthy AI orchestration integrating governance, human input, audit trails, and semantic coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between AI technical capabilities and institutional accountability by embedding governance into AI ecosystems.

Method: Proposes Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI within a Control-Panel architecture, drawing from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance.

Result: A unified assurance framework that ensures AI systems are verifiable, transparent, reproducible, and under meaningful human control.

Conclusion: Trustworthiness can be systematically engineered into AI systems through integrated governance architectures.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly assume consequential decision-making roles, a widening gap has emerged between technical capabilities and institutional accountability. Ethical guidance alone is insufficient to counter this challenge; it demands architectures that embed governance into the execution fabric of the ecosystem. This paper presents the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI, a comprehensive assurance framework that integrates human input, semantic coherence, audit and provenance integrity into a unified Control-Panel architecture. Unlike conventional agentic AI initiatives that primarily focus on AI-to-AI coordination, the proposed framework provides an umbrella of governance to the entire AI components, their consumers and human participants. By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.

*Quanmin Wei,Penglin Dai,Wei Li,Bingyi Liu,Xiao Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfoCom: An information-aware collaborative perception framework that reduces communication overhead from MB to KB scale while maintaining near-lossless performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental communication-performance trade-off in collaborative perception, particularly overcoming practical network constraints that limit existing approaches.

Method: Introduces an information purification paradigm using extended Information Bottleneck principles, featuring Information-Aware Encoding, Sparse Mask Generation, and Multi-Scale Decoding.

Result: Achieves 440-fold and 90-fold communication reduction per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP respectively, while maintaining near-lossless perception across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: InfoCom establishes a theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception, demonstrating feasibility of KB-scale communication without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Precise environmental perception is critical for the reliability of autonomous driving systems. While collaborative perception mitigates the limitations of single-agent perception through information sharing, it encounters a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing communication-efficient approaches typically assume MB-level data transmission per collaboration, which may fail due to practical network constraints. To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively.

TL;DR: Proposes a user-feedback-driven continual adaptation framework for Vision-and-Language Navigation that integrates human corrections to improve performance and stability, outperforming strong baselines on GSA-R2R.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GSA-VLN frameworks rely solely on unsupervised adaptation and exclude valuable user feedback, which limits realism and adaptation quality in real-world deployment.

Method: Extends GSA-VLN with a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that converts navigation instructions and corrective signals into environment-aligned training data, and incorporates a memory-bank warm-start mechanism to reuse prior knowledge.

Result: Experiments on GSA-R2R benchmark show consistent improvements over baselines like GR-DUET, with enhanced navigation success and path efficiency, and stable early navigation via memory-bank warm start.

Conclusion: The proposed user-feedback-driven adaptation framework effectively improves VLN agents' navigation performance by integrating human feedback into continual learning, offering a robust and generalizable solution for real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to navigate complex environments by following natural-language instructions. General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions.

TL;DR: ACE fixes Marginal Path Collapse in ratio-of-densities steering, turning unstable heterogeneous expert composition into reliable controllable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the previously unformalized failure mode called Marginal Path Collapse in ratio-of-densities steering methods, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets.

Method: 1. Derives a simple path existence criterion predicting exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents. 2. Introduces Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents, guaranteeing a valid probability path.

Result: ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models on both synthetic 2D benchmarks and flexible-pose scaffold decoration tasks.

Conclusion: The ratio-of-densities method for inference-time steering has a fundamental flaw called Marginal Path Collapse, but the authors provide a complete solution through theoretical analysis and practical correction (ACE), transforming this approach from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for compositional generation.

Abstract: Inference-time steering enables pretrained diffusion/flow models to be adapted to new tasks without retraining. A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models. Our work turns ratio-of-densities steering with heterogeneous experts from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for controllable generation.

TL;DR: REMISVFU enables efficient client-level unlearning in Vertical Federated Learning systems by collapsing encoder outputs to random anchors and optimizing retention/forgetting losses through orthogonal projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning and are ineffective for Vertical Federated Learning's feature-partitioned architecture.

Method: Proposes representation misdirection framework where forgetting party collapses encoder output to random anchor; server jointly optimizes retention loss and forgetting loss using orthogonal projection.

Result: Suppresses back-door attack success to natural class-prior level with only ~2.5% clean accuracy sacrifice, outperforming SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: REMISVFU provides effective plug-and-play solution for client-level unlearning in VFL systems while maintaining utility.

Abstract: Data-protection regulations such as the GDPR grant every participant in a federated system a right to be forgotten. Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EmerFlow is a framework that uses LLMs and meta-learning to create effective embeddings for emerging items with limited interaction data


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods oversimplify the challenge of recommending emerging items by assuming they have few historical interactions, failing to balance item uniqueness with shared patterns

Method: LLM-empowered representation learning that enriches emerging item features through reasoning, aligns representations with existing embedding space, and refines embeddings via meta-learning using new interactions

Result: Extensive experiments show EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse domains including movies and pharmaceuticals

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully learns expressive embeddings for emerging items from limited interactions by combining LLM reasoning with meta-learning approaches

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the challenge of recommending emerging items, whose interactions gradually accumulate over time. Existing methods often overlook this dynamic process, typically assuming that emerging items have few or even no historical interactions. Such an assumption oversimplifies the problem, as a good model must preserve the uniqueness of emerging items while leveraging their shared patterns with established ones. To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: AgentProg: A program-guided approach using program structure and belief states to manage mobile GUI agent context efficiently, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile GUI agents for long-horizon task automation face context overhead from expanding interaction history, and existing context management techniques often lose vital semantic information.

Method: Reframe interaction history as a program with variables and control flow to guide context retention/discard decisions, plus integrate a global belief state mechanism for partial observability and environmental adaptation.

Result: State-of-the-art success rates on AndroidWorld and extended long-horizon task benchmarks, with robust performance while baselines degrade catastrophically.

Conclusion: AgentProg provides a principled context management solution that overcomes limitations of prior methods, maintaining efficiency and robustness in long-horizon mobile task automation.

Abstract: The rapid development of mobile GUI agents has stimulated growing research interest in long-horizon task automation. However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation.

TL;DR: Proposes SaEI method using selective-adversarial entropy intervention during RL sampling to enhance vision-language models' reasoning capabilities by improving response diversity without distorting factual knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based finetuning methods only intervene in entropy during policy optimization but ignore entropy intervention during RL sampling, which could boost performance by improving response diversity.

Method: Selective-adversarial Entropy Intervention (SaEI) with two components: 1) Entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) formulating entropy as adversarial objective for gradient-based visual input attacks, and 2) Token-selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize attack effectiveness without distorting factual knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show significant improvement in policy exploration and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: SaEI effectively enhances policy entropy during RL sampling to boost VLM reasoning capabilities through improved exploration of answer space.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has become a common choice in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Considering existing RL- based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing stud- ies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token- selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the ef- fectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities. Code will be released once the paper is accepted.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel string-based representation of graph adjacency matrices using simple instructions, making graphs compatible with deep learning language models while maintaining structural patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph representations (based on adjacency matrices) are not amenable to processing by powerful deep learning language models that specialize in text processing. There's a need to bridge graph structures with text-based deep learning approaches.

Method: Proposes a new method to represent graphs by transforming adjacency matrices into strings of simple instructions. These instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step in a reversible manner (graphs can be converted to strings and vice versa).

Result: The representation is compact and maintains local structural patterns of graphs. A tentative computational experiment shows favorable results. The transformation enables graph processing by deep learning language models.

Conclusion: This string-based graph representation could boost graph processing capabilities of deep learning models by making graphs compatible with text-based language model architectures while preserving structural information.

Abstract: The representation of graphs is commonly based on the adjacency matrix concept. This formulation is the foundation of most algebraic and computational approaches to graph processing. The advent of deep learning language models offers a wide range of powerful computational models that are specialized in the processing of text. However, current procedures to represent graphs are not amenable to processing by these models. In this work, a new method to represent graphs is proposed. It represents the adjacency matrix of a graph by a string of simple instructions. The instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step. The transformation is reversible, i.e. given a graph the string can be produced and vice versa. The proposed representation is compact and it maintains the local structural patterns of the graph. Therefore, it is envisaged that it could be useful to boost the processing of graphs by deep learning models. A tentative computational experiment is reported, with favorable results.

*Hojun Lee,Mijin Koo,Yeji Song,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAFAP introduces trajectory alignment via adversarial perturbations to achieve effective targeted data protection in diffusion models by controlling the entire training trajectory rather than just snapshots


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protection methods for text-to-image models only degrade image quality passively and lack stable control, while existing TDP approaches suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching limitations

Method: TAFAP uses trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent transformations throughout fine-tuning, controlling both identity and visual patterns

Result: TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality

Conclusion: This work enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have made fine-tuning text-to-image models for personalization increasingly accessible, but have also raised significant concerns regarding unauthorized data usage and privacy infringement. Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality. This work enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how adversarial PDF manipulation can exploit LLM-based peer review systems to flip 'Reject' decisions to 'Accept', proposing a new evaluation metric (WAVS) and demonstrating successful attacks across 13 language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the growing integration of LLMs in scientific peer review, including both individual reviewer use and formal institutional deployment, raising concerns about system vulnerabilities to strategic manipulation.

Method: The authors curated 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to test adversarial PDF manipulation, evaluating them across 13 language models including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek.

Result: Results show that obfuscation strategies like 'Maximum Mark Magyk' successfully manipulate review scores, achieving concerning decision flip rates even in large-scale AI models, demonstrating significant vulnerability in LLM-as-a-Judge systems.

Conclusion: The study reveals critical vulnerabilities in AI-powered peer review systems to adversarial manipulation, highlighting the need for more robust defenses and providing tools (dataset and framework) for future research on this security threat.

Abstract: The landscape of scientific peer review is rapidly evolving with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the "Lazy Reviewer" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these "LLM-as-a-Judge" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept," for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models. We will release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate more research on this topic.

*Lim Chien Her,Ming Yan,Yunshu Bai,Ruihao Li,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agent architecture enables zero-shot parameter tuning for PCG tools without model training, allowing natural language control over complex content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PCG systems require precise parameter configuration but lack intuitive controls. Off-the-shelf LLMs struggle to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict technical parameters needed for content generation.

Method: A training-free system with two LLM agents (Actor and Critic) working iteratively to interpret natural language instructions, reason over tool parameters, and refine configurations autonomously.

Result: The approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid 3D environments from natural language descriptions, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG.

Conclusion: LLM agent architectures can be effectively adapted for PCG parameter tuning without task-specific fine-tuning, offering a scalable method for complex creative software control.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) offers scalable methods for algorithmically creating complex, customizable worlds. However, controlling these pipelines requires the precise configuration of opaque technical parameters. We propose a training-free architecture that utilizes LLM agents for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a natural language interface for PCG tools, off-the-shelf models often fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications. Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions. These results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools. By shifting the burden from model training to architectural reasoning, our method offers a scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning.

TL;DR: InternGeometry is a medalist-level LLM agent for solving IMO geometry problems using iterative proposition/verification cycles and dynamic memory, achieving gold-medal performance with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing AI approaches in geometry problem-solving by developing an LLM agent capable of handling IMO-level problems using novel auxiliary constructions.

Method: Iterative proposal of propositions/constructions, verification with symbolic engine, reflection on feedback, dynamic memory for extensive interactions, and Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL).

Result: Solves 44/50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding average gold medalist score (40.9) using only 13K training examples (0.004% of AlphaGeometry 2's data).

Conclusion: Demonstrates LLM agents' potential for expert-level geometry tasks, capable of novel auxiliary constructions not found in human solutions.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents exhibit strong mathematical problem-solving abilities and can even solve International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems with the assistance of formal proof systems. However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NormCode is a semiformal language that prevents context pollution in multistep LLM workflows by enforcing strict data isolation between steps and separating semantic operations from syntactic ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address context pollution issues in multistep LLM workflows where accumulated information causes hallucinations, confusion, and loss of task constraints.

Method: Introduce NormCode with three isomorphic formats (.ncds, .ncd, .ncn) for plan construction, execution, and verification. Use strict separation between semantic (non-deterministic LLM reasoning) and syntactic (deterministic data restructuring) operations.

Result: Validated through two demonstrations: base X addition algorithm achieving 100% accuracy on arbitrary length inputs, and self-hosting of NormCode's five-phase compiler pipeline.

Conclusion: NormCode enables auditable AI workflows with transparent cost and reliability tracing, addressing critical needs in high-stakes domains like legal, medical, and financial applications.

Abstract: Multistep workflows that chain large language model (LLM) calls suffer from context pollution: as information accumulates across steps, models hallucinate, confuse intermediate outputs, and lose track of task constraints. We present NormCode, a semiformal language for constructing plans of inferences, structured decompositions where each step operates in data isolation and receives only explicitly passed inputs, which eliminates crossstep contamination by design. NormCode enforces a strict separation between semantic operations (LLMdriven reasoning, nondeterministic) and syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring), enabling precise cost and reliability tracing. The language exists in three isomorphic formats: .ncds for human authoring, .ncd for machine execution, and .ncn for human verification, supporting progressive formalization from sketch to production. We validate NormCode through two demonstrations: (1) a base X addition algorithm achieving 100 percent accuracy on arbitrary length inputs, and (2) self hosted execution of NormCode's own five phase compiler pipeline. The working orchestrator provides dependency driven scheduling, SQLite backed checkpointing, and loop management, making AI workflows auditable by design and addressing a critical need for transparency in high stakes domains such as legal reasoning, medical decision making, and financial analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Phythesis integrates LLMs with physics-guided optimization for automated energy-efficient data center layout design


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional simulation-based DC design scales poorly, while AI methods lack physics considerations

Method: Iterative bi-level optimization: LLM generates plausible layouts, physics optimization selects optimal parameters

Result: 57.3% higher generation success rate and 11.5% PUE improvement over LLM-only baseline

Conclusion: Combining LLMs with physics optimization enables effective automated DC design meeting operational objectives

Abstract: Data center (DC) infrastructure serves as the backbone to support the escalating demand for computing capacity. Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.

TL;DR: scRCL framework uses contrastive learning with cell-gene interactions to improve unsupervised cell type identification in single-cell omics data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering methods for single-cell omics often focus only on intrinsic cellular structure while ignoring cell-gene associations, limiting their ability to distinguish closely related cell types.

Method: Proposes scRCL (Refinement Contrastive Learning) framework that incorporates: 1) Two contrastive distribution alignment components to reveal cellular structures using cell-cell relationships, and 2) A refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing cell-gene associations.

Result: Extensive experiments on single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets show scRCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Biological analyses confirm recovered populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures.

Conclusion: scRCL effectively incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations, demonstrating superior performance in unsupervised cell type identification.

Abstract: Unsupervised cell type identification is crucial for uncovering and characterizing heterogeneous populations in single cell omics studies. Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Moreover, downstream biological analyses confirm that the recovered cell populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures, further validating the biological relevance of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAPTAIN is a training-free framework that mitigates memorization in diffusion models by modifying latent features during denoising, using frequency-based noise initialization, optimal timestep identification, and feature injection from reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns, and existing mitigation methods struggle to reduce memorization without compromising prompt alignment.

Method: CAPTAIN applies frequency-based noise initialization, identifies optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection, localizes memorized regions, and injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions.

Result: Experiments show CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.

Conclusion: CAPTAIN effectively mitigates memorization in diffusion models without compromising prompt fidelity and visual quality, offering a practical training-free solution for privacy and copyright protection.

Abstract: Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns as these systems are increasingly deployed at scale. Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt. We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.

TL;DR: Value diversity enhances stability and creativity in LLM-based multi-agent systems but has diminishing returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how value diversity shapes collective behavior in AI communities.

Method: Multi-agent simulations using Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values for value elicitation and constitution formation.

Result: Value diversity improves value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and increases creative principles, though extreme heterogeneity causes instability.

Conclusion: Value diversity is a key factor for AI capability, linking AI systems with sociological institutional emergence.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLM) based multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, the collective behaviors, e.g., collective intelligence, of such artificial communities have drawn growing attention. This work aims to answer a fundamental question: How does diversity of values shape the collective behavior of AI communities? Using naturalistic value elicitation grounded in the prevalent Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, we constructed multi-agent simulations where communities with varying numbers of agents engaged in open-ended interactions and constitution formation. The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance. However, these effects also show diminishing returns: extreme heterogeneity induces instability. This work positions value diversity as a new axis of future AI capability, bridging AI ability and sociological studies of institutional emergence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hardware-aware NAS framework for optimizing early-exit networks with strengthened exit branches, achieving higher accuracy with same/lower computational costs compared to SOTA approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-exit networks reduce computation for simpler inputs but require careful balancing of efficiency and performance. Existing NAS methods focus on exit positioning without optimizing exit branch architecture.

Method: Propose hardware-aware NAS that optimizes both exit branch depth/layer types and adaptive threshold tuning, evaluated on CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN datasets.

Result: Framework designs early-exit networks achieving higher accuracy with same/lower average MACs than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Comprehensive optimization of exit branch architecture through NAS significantly improves early-exit network performance for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Early-exit networks are effective solutions for reducing the overall energy consumption and latency of deep learning models by adjusting computation based on the complexity of input data. By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

*Manon Kempermann,Sai Suresh Macharla Vasu,Mahalakshmi Raveenthiran,Theo Farrell,Ingmar Weber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that current LLM safety evaluations fail to account for individual context in high-stakes domains like finance and health, showing that context-aware evaluation methods are necessary for vulnerable populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM safety evaluations focus on universal risks rather than context-dependent harms for individual users in high-stakes domains.

Method: Evaluated financial and health advice from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles with varying vulnerability levels, comparing context-blind versus context-aware evaluations.

Result: Identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators, with safety scores dropping from 5/7 to 3/7 for high-vulnerability users when context was considered. Context disclosure in user prompts alone did not improve safety ratings.

Conclusion: Effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires assessing responses against diverse user profiles rather than relying solely on context disclosure, demanding approaches distinct from universal-risk frameworks.

Abstract: Safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) typically focus on universal risks like dangerous capabilities or undesirable propensities. However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks. We publish our code and dataset to aid future developments.

TL;DR: RL with clinically-grounded rewards enhances CXR interpretation in vision-language models, achieving SOTA performance on report generation and visual grounding, but explicit 'thinking' doesn't provide additional benefits beyond SFT+RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effects of reinforcement learning and explicit intermediate reasoning ('thinking') in a chest X-ray vision-language model, addressing limitations of purely supervised fine-tuning approaches that optimize next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality.

Method: Conducting large-scale SFT on CXR data to build a RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by cold-start SFT to equip the model with basic thinking ability, then applying Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding. Experiments are run on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants with and without thinking.

Result: RL provides additional gains on both report generation and visual grounding tasks, while explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. The RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.

Conclusion: While strong supervised fine-tuning remains crucial for baseline performance, reinforcement learning with clinically-grounded rewards provides additional gains on chest X-ray report generation and visual grounding tasks, outperforming baseline models and achieving state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation in multiple aspects. However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReMe introduces a dynamic memory framework for LLM agents that actively refines experiences through distillation, adaptive reuse, and utility-based refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static memory frameworks suffer from passive accumulation, lacking dynamic reasoning capabilities for lifelong learning.

Method: Multi-faceted distillation extracts patterns, context-adaptive reuse tailors insights, and utility-based refinement maintains memory quality.

Result: ReMe outperforms larger models, showing memory-scaling effects and efficient lifelong learning.

Conclusion: ReMe bridges static storage and dynamic reasoning, offering a computation-efficient pathway for agent evolution.

Abstract: Procedural memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to internalize "how-to" knowledge, theoretically reducing redundant trial-and-error. However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a "passive accumulation" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning. We release our code and the $\texttt{reme.library}$ dataset to facilitate further research.

TL;DR: CA-GPT, a specialized AI for OCT-guided PCI, outperformed both general ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians in procedure planning and assessment, showing higher agreement with expert decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address operator-dependent variability in OCT interpretation and lack of domain-specific reliability in general AI by evaluating a specialized large model for PCI guidance.

Method: Single-center analysis comparing procedural decisions from CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians against expert records using 10 metrics for 96 patients undergoing OCT-guided PCI.

Result: CA-GPT showed significantly higher agreement scores than both comparators in pre-PCI planning (median 5 vs 3/4) and post-PCI assessment (5 vs 4/5), with particular superiority in stent selection metrics.

Conclusion: CA-GPT provides standardized, reliable OCT interpretation that can augment operator expertise and optimize PCI outcomes, demonstrating superiority over general AI and junior physicians.

Abstract: Background: While intravascular imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography (OCT), improves percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes, its interpretation is operator-dependent. General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.
  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.
  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.
  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases. This approach provides a standardized and reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation, demonstrating significant potential to augment operator expertise and optimize OCT-guided PCI.

### [47] [Replace, Don't Expand: Mitigating Context Dilution in Multi-Hop RAG via Fixed-Budget Evidence Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10787)
*Moshe Lahmy,Roi Yozevitch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAL-RAG is a training-free controller that uses a "replace, don't expand" strategy to improve multi-hop retrieval by actively swapping distractors for gap-filling evidence, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG approaches for multi-hop queries often suffer from context dilution when expanding context windows. Current corrective methods (Self-RAG, CRAG, Adaptive-k) typically add more context or prune lists, which can crowd out relevant information.

Method: SEAL-RAG executes a Search → Extract → Assess → Loop cycle: performs entity-anchored extraction to build gap specifications, triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses entity-first ranking to actively replace distractors with gap-closing evidence under fixed retrieval depth k.

Result: On HotpotQA (k=3): +3-13 pp improvement in answer correctness and +12-18 pp in evidence precision over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA (k=5): +8.0 pp accuracy over Adaptive-k with 96% evidence precision vs 22% for CRAG. Gains are statistically significant (p<0.001).

Conclusion: SEAL-RAG's fixed-k replacement strategy provides predictable costs while optimizing top-k slots for precision over breadth, effectively combating context dilution in multi-hop retrieval scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often fail on multi-hop queries when the initial retrieval misses a bridge fact. Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\textbf{S}earch $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E}xtract $\rightarrow$ \textbf{A}ssess $\rightarrow$ \textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \textbf{HotpotQA} and \textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \textbf{96\%} evidence precision compared to 22\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth. We release our code and data at https://github.com/mosherino/SEAL-RAG.

*Wang Lu,Yao Zhu,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introducing HAROOD: a comprehensive benchmark for human activity recognition (HAR) in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, addressing cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time variations with modular implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD algorithms in HAR lack comprehensive testing across diverse distribution shift scenarios, creating uncertainty about their effectiveness and necessity.

Method: Developed a benchmark with 4 OOD scenarios, 6 datasets, 16 methods (CNN/Transformer-based), and 2 model selection protocols via extensive experiments.

Result: No single OOD method consistently outperforms others, revealing significant room for improvement in HAR under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: HAROOD provides a modular, extensible framework to advance OOD research in HAR, with findings underscoring the need for more robust algorithms.

Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) mines activity patterns from the time-series sensory data. In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR. Our implementation is released and can be found at https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/HAROOD.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agile Deliberation framework helps users refine vague visual concepts through iterative borderline case exposure and structured deliberation, outperforming automated and manual baselines with higher F1 scores and better user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-in-the-loop approaches assume users have clear concept understanding from the start, but in reality users often begin with vague ideas that need iterative refinement through concept deliberation - a practice discovered from content moderation experts.

Method: Two-stage deliberation framework: (1) concept scoping decomposes initial concept into structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align image classifier with evolving user intent.

Result: 18 user sessions (1.5h each) showed Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation. Participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.

Conclusion: Agile Deliberation successfully supports evolving and subjective concepts through structured deliberation, demonstrating practical value for applications requiring vision classifiers for visual concepts where user understanding evolves iteratively.

Abstract: From content moderation to content curation, applications requiring vision classifiers for visual concepts are rapidly expanding. Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through "concept deliberation", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called "Agile Deliberation" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.

### [50] [V-OCBF: Learning Safety Filters from Offline Data via Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10822)
*Mumuksh Tayal,Manan Tayal,Aditya Singh,Shishir Kolathaya,Ravi Prakash*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V-OCBF framework learns neural Control Barrier Functions from offline data without dynamics models, using finite-difference barrier updates and expectile objectives to ensure safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Safe Offline RL methods only enforce soft constraints without forward invariance guarantees, while traditional CBFs require manual design or full system knowledge.

Method: Learns neural CBF via recursive finite-difference barrier updates from offline demonstrations, incorporates expectile-based objective constraints, and synthesizes safe control using Quadratic Programming.

Result: Substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods across case studies while maintaining strong task performance.

Conclusion: V-OCBF enables scalable offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous systems requires controllers that satisfy hard, state-wise constraints without relying on online interaction. While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.

### [51] [LLMs Can Assist with Proposal Selection at Large User Facilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10895)
*Lijie Ding,Janell Thomson,Jon Taylor,Changwoo Do*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively rank scientific proposals with performance comparable to humans at much lower cost, while enabling advanced analyses like similarity assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human proposal reviewing suffers from inconsistency and bias, while rigorous pairwise comparison methods are impractical due to quadratic workload.

Method: Used LLMs with pairwise preference-based ranking on proposal data from three beamlines at SNS/ORNL, comparing against human rankings and assessing publication potential.

Result: LLM rankings strongly correlate with human rankings (Spearman ρ≈0.2-0.8, improving to ≥0.5 after outlier removal) and match human performance in identifying high-publication-potential proposals at 100x lower cost.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a scalable, cost-effective alternative to human review that maintains quality while enabling additional analytical capabilities beneficial for review committees.

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) can enhance the proposal selection process at large user facilities, offering a scalable, consistent, and cost-effective alternative to traditional human review. Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $ρ\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\geq 0.5$ after 10\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less. Beyond ranking, LLMs enable advanced analyses that are challenging for humans, such as quantitative assessment of proposal similarity via embedding models, which provides information crucial for review committees.

*Muhammad Umair Haider,Hammad Rizwan,Hassan Sajjad,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A node-level pruning framework for circuit discovery in LLMs that uses learnable multi-granularity masks with sparsity penalties to identify minimal subnetworks more efficiently than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing circuit discovery methods rely on iterative edge pruning, which is computationally expensive and limited to coarse-grained units, overlooking finer structures like individual neurons.

Method: Introduces learnable masks across multiple granularity levels (from blocks to neurons) within a unified optimization objective, using granularity-specific sparsity penalties to enable comprehensive compression in a single fine-tuning run.

Result: Identifies smaller circuits than prior methods, shows many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant while maintaining performance, and has 5-10x lower memory footprint by avoiding intermediate activation storage.

Conclusion: The proposed node-level pruning framework addresses scalability and granularity limitations of existing circuit discovery approaches, enabling more efficient and precise identification of minimal functional subnetworks.

Abstract: Circuit discovery aims to identify minimal subnetworks that are responsible for specific behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches primarily rely on iterative edge pruning, which is computationally expensive and limited to coarse-grained units such as attention heads or MLP blocks, overlooking finer structures like individual neurons. We propose a node-level pruning framework for circuit discovery that addresses both scalability and granularity limitations. Our method introduces learnable masks across multiple levels of granularity, from entire blocks to individual neurons, within a unified optimization objective. Granularity-specific sparsity penalties guide the pruning process, allowing a comprehensive compression in a single fine-tuning run. Empirically, our approach identifies circuits that are smaller in nodes than those discovered by prior methods; moreover, we demonstrate that many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant, while still maintaining task performance. Furthermore, our method has a significantly lower memory footprint, 5-10x, as it does not require keeping intermediate activations in the memory to work.

TL;DR: This paper establishes a correspondence between POMDP agents and quantum process functions, showing dual interpretations where the process function can represent either the environment or the agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge concepts between artificial intelligence (specifically POMDP agents) and quantum information theory (process functions), revealing structural similarities and enabling cross-domain insights.

Method: Identify agent policies and memory updates in POMDPs as one-input process functions, using the link product for interaction. Extend this to multi-agent systems via decentralized POMDPs.

Result: A precise mapping showing that POMDP agents correspond to process functions, with dual interpretations (physics view: process function as environment; AI view: as agent).

Conclusion: The correspondence unifies AI and quantum frameworks, suggesting that process functions provide a natural model for multi-agent POMDPs and enabling future interdisciplinary applications.

Abstract: We establish a precise correspondence between decision-making agents in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and one-input process functions, the classical limit of higher-order quantum operations. In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments. We extend this perspective to multi-agent systems by identifying observation-independent decentralized POMDPs as natural domains for multi-input process functions.

TL;DR: HGC-Herd: Training-free heterogeneous graph condensation framework using feature propagation and class-wise herding for efficient representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HGNNs face scalability challenges on large graphs due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional features. Existing condensation methods are designed for homogeneous graphs and suffer from computational overhead.

Method: Proposes HGC-Herd with lightweight feature propagation for multi-hop relational context encoding and class-wise herding mechanism to identify representative nodes per class.

Result: Experimental validation on ACM, DBLP, and Freebase shows comparable/superior accuracy to full-graph training with significantly reduced runtime and memory consumption.

Conclusion: HGC-Herd provides practical value for efficient and scalable heterogeneous graph representation learning by maintaining semantic and structural fidelity while optimizing resource usage.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have demonstrated strong capability in modeling complex semantics across multi-type nodes and relations. However, their scalability to large-scale graphs remains challenging due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional node features. Existing graph condensation approaches, such as GCond, are primarily developed for homogeneous graphs and rely on gradient matching, resulting in considerable computational, memory, and optimization overhead. We propose HGC-Herd, a training-free condensation framework that generates compact yet informative heterogeneous graphs while maintaining both semantic and structural fidelity. HGC-Herd integrates lightweight feature propagation to encode multi-hop relational context and employs a class-wise herding mechanism to identify representative nodes per class, producing balanced and discriminative subsets for downstream learning tasks. Extensive experiments on ACM, DBLP, and Freebase validate that HGC-Herd attains comparable or superior accuracy to full-graph training while markedly reducing both runtime and memory consumption. These results underscore its practical value for efficient and scalable heterogeneous graph representation learning.

TL;DR: DEFCON framework uses Graph Attention Networks to quantify soccer defenders' contributions by measuring how they affect opponents' Expected Possession Value


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional soccer analytics focus on visible defensive actions but miss defenders' true impact in preventing dangerous opportunities before they arise

Method: Proposes DEFCON framework using Graph Attention Networks to estimate success probability and expected value of attacking options, calculating EPV changes

Result: DEFCON's player credits show strong positive correlations with market valuations when tested on Eredivisie data

Conclusion: DEFCON provides comprehensive defensive evaluation with practical applications for in-game analysis and spatial assessments

Abstract: Evaluating defensive performance in soccer remains challenging, as effective defending is often expressed not through visible on-ball actions such as interceptions and tackles, but through preventing dangerous opportunities before they arise. Existing approaches have largely focused on valuing on-ball actions, leaving much of defenders' true impact unmeasured. To address this gap, we propose DEFCON (DEFensive CONtribution evaluator), a comprehensive framework that quantifies player-level defensive contributions for every attacking situation in soccer. Leveraging Graph Attention Networks, DEFCON estimates the success probability and expected value of each attacking option, along with each defender's responsibility for stopping it. These components yield an Expected Possession Value (EPV) for the attacking team before and after each action, and DEFCON assigns positive or negative credits to defenders according to whether they reduced or increased the opponent's EPV. Trained on 2023-24 and evaluated on 2024-25 Eredivisie event and tracking data, DEFCON's aggregated player credits exhibit strong positive correlations with market valuations. Finally, we showcase several practical applications, including in-game timelines of defensive contributions, spatial analyses across pitch zones, and pairwise summaries of attacker-defender interactions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BAMBO is a Bayesian adaptive optimization framework that automatically constructs LLM Pareto sets via optimal block partitioning, overcoming limitations of existing merging approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging techniques fail at constructing Pareto sets for LLM capability-efficiency trade-offs: model-level methods yield sparse suboptimal solutions, layer-wise approaches suffer from dimensional intractability.

Method: Introduces BAMBO framework with Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy formulated as 1D clustering problem solved via dynamic programming, integrated within evolutionary loop with qEHVI acquisition function.

Result: Demonstrates superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontiers than baselines, enabling agile model selection for diverse operational constraints.

Conclusion: BAMBO provides an effective automated solution for constructing LLM Pareto sets by intelligently partitioning models to balance search granularity and computational feasibility.

Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

*Marvin Alles,Xingyuan Zhang,Patrick van der Smagt,Philip Becker-Ehmck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent-action world models learn from both action-labeled and action-free data by aligning control signals with inferred latent actions, achieving strong performance with far fewer labeled samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans learn efficiently by combining direct interaction with passive observation, while standard world models are limited by their reliance on action-labeled data which is often scarce.

Method: Introduce a family of latent-action world models that learn a shared latent action representation, enabling a single dynamics model to train on both action-conditioned and large-scale unlabeled trajectories.

Result: On DeepMind Control Suite, the approach achieves strong performance while using about 10x fewer action-labeled samples compared to purely action-conditioned baselines.

Conclusion: Latent actions enable efficient world model training by bridging offline RL and action-free learning, demonstrating the value of combining passive and interactive data.

Abstract: Inspired by how humans combine direct interaction with action-free experience (e.g., videos), we study world models that learn from heterogeneous data. Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.

TL;DR: Paper introduces Cluster-DAGs to encode prior knowledge for causal discovery, creating Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI algorithms that outperform baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal discovery methods struggle with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. Incorporating prior knowledge can significantly aid the causal discovery process.

Method: They propose the Cluster-DAG framework for encoding prior knowledge and introduce two modified constraint-based algorithms: Cluster-PC for fully observed settings and Cluster-FCI for partially observed settings.

Result: Empirical evaluation on simulated data shows that Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI outperform their baseline counterparts (PC and FCI) when no prior knowledge is used.

Conclusion: Cluster-DAGs provide a flexible and effective framework for incorporating prior knowledge in causal discovery, leading to improved performance over baseline methods without such knowledge.

Abstract: Finding cause-effect relationships is of key importance in science. Causal discovery aims to recover a graph from data that succinctly describes these cause-effect relationships. However, current methods face several challenges, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. Incorporating prior knowledge about the system can aid causal discovery. In this work, we leverage Cluster-DAGs as a prior knowledge framework to warm-start causal discovery. We show that Cluster-DAGs offer greater flexibility than existing approaches based on tiered background knowledge and introduce two modified constraint-based algorithms, Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI, for causal discovery in the fully and partially observed setting, respectively. Empirical evaluation on simulated data demonstrates that Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI outperform their respective baselines without prior knowledge.

TL;DR: HB-SGE is a robust first-order optimization method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation to prevent divergence on ill-conditioned and non-convex problems where NAG and standard momentum fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerated gradient methods like NAG achieve fast convergence on well-conditioned problems but often diverge on ill-conditioned or non-convex landscapes due to aggressive momentum accumulation.

Method: Combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation using local Taylor approximations to estimate future gradient directions, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability.

Result: On ill-conditioned quadratics (κ=50), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while SGD and NAG diverge. On non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE converges in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge in 10 steps.

Conclusion: While NAG remains faster on well-conditioned problems, HB-SGE provides a robust alternative with speedup over SGD across diverse landscapes, requiring only O(d) memory overhead and same hyperparameters as standard momentum.

Abstract: Accelerated gradient methods like Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) achieve faster convergence on well-conditioned problems but often diverge on ill-conditioned or non-convex landscapes due to aggressive momentum accumulation. We propose Heavy-Ball Synthetic Gradient Extrapolation (HB-SGE), a robust first-order method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation. Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $κ=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps. While NAG remains faster on well-conditioned problems, HB-SGE provides a robust alternative with speedup over SGD across diverse landscapes, requiring only $O(d)$ memory overhead and the same hyperparameters as standard momentum.

*Skyler Wu,Aymen Echarghaoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: New MRPO weighting strategies improve preference accuracy, but single-reference DPO often outperforms multiple-reference methods, questioning their practical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MRPO weighting methods are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance.

Method: Proposal of four new weighting strategies for MRPO: two offline (using held-out validation), one online (sliding-window estimator), and one online (Thompson Sampling as K-armed bandit).

Result: All four new strategies outperform current MRPO methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy; surprisingly, single-reference DPO using 6 of 7 references consistently outperforms all multiple-reference approaches.

Conclusion: Multiple-reference methods may not be practically superior to single-reference DPO despite theoretical appeal; careful weighting strategies are crucial but may not justify added complexity.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is integral for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy. More thought-provokingly, however, we find that single-reference DPO, using any of 6 out of 7 references, consistently outperforms all tested multiple-reference approaches -- calling into question the practical appeal of multiple-reference approaches.

Motivation: To enable unsupervised pre-training for RL agents without task-specific rewards by focusing on state entropy maximization (SEM), allowing learning of a prior policy for downstream tasks.

Method: SEMDICE: a principled off-policy algorithm that directly optimizes the policy in the space of stationary distributions to compute a single, stationary Markov state-entropy-maximizing policy from any off-policy dataset.

Result: Experiments show SEMDICE outperforms baseline algorithms in maximizing state entropy and achieves the best adaptation efficiency for downstream tasks among SEM-based unsupervised RL pre-training methods.

Conclusion: SEMDICE effectively enables unsupervised RL pre-training by maximizing state entropy from off-policy data, providing efficient adaptation to downstream tasks.

Abstract: In the unsupervised pre-training for reinforcement learning, the agent aims to learn a prior policy for downstream tasks without relying on task-specific reward functions. We focus on state entropy maximization (SEM), where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the entropy of the state stationary distribution. In this paper, we introduce SEMDICE, a principled off-policy algorithm that computes an SEM policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset, which optimizes the policy directly within the space of stationary distributions. SEMDICE computes a single, stationary Markov state-entropy-maximizing policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMDICE outperforms baseline algorithms in maximizing state entropy while achieving the best adaptation efficiency for downstream tasks among SEM-based unsupervised RL pre-training methods.

TL;DR: A three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using multiple small LLMs outperforms individual models on Portuguese datasets without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs under-perform in NER for lower-resource languages like Portuguese, and no single model dominates all tasks, motivating ensemble approaches.

Method: A novel three-step ensemble pipeline using similarly capable, locally run LLMs with a heuristic to select optimal model combinations using minimal annotated data.

Result: Outperforms individual LLMs in four out of five Portuguese NER datasets and shows cross-dataset effectiveness.

Conclusion: Advances scalable, low-resource, and zero-shot NER by effectively combining multiple small LLMs without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks through in-context learning but often under-perform in Named Entity Recognition (NER), especially for lower-resource languages like Portuguese. While open-weight LLMs enable local deployment, no single model dominates all tasks, motivating ensemble approaches. However, existing LLM ensembles focus on text generation or classification, leaving NER under-explored. In this context, this work proposes a novel three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using similarly capable, locally run LLMs. Our method outperforms individual LLMs in four out of five Portuguese NER datasets by leveraging a heuristic to select optimal model combinations with minimal annotated data. Moreover, we show that ensembles obtained on different source datasets generally outperform individual LLMs in cross-dataset configurations, potentially eliminating the need for annotated data for the current task. Our work advances scalable, low-resource, and zero-shot NER by effectively combining multiple small LLMs without fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/Joao-Luz/local-llm-ner-ensemble.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes least-action method to find macroscopic physical law (detailed balance) in LLM generation, showing LLMs learn underlying potential functions, not general rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-driven agents show empirical success but lack theoretical understanding; need theoretical framework to unify macroscopic dynamics of complex AI systems beyond engineering practices.

Method: Proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate generative directionality by experimentally measuring transition probabilities between LLM-generated states and statistically analyzing detailed balance.

Result: Discovery of detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating implicit learning of potential functions that transcend LLM architectures and prompt templates—the first macroscopic physical law independent of model specifics.

Conclusion: Based on experiments, the authors discover detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating generation is not achieved by general rule learning, but by implicitly learning underlying potential functions that transcend architectures and prompts, representing the first macroscopic physical law independent of model details.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven agents are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for solving complex problems. Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.

Motivation: Transformers face scalability issues due to quadratic complexity in large-scale time series forecasting tasks.

Method: Replaces self-attention with learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficients to capture multi-scale patterns efficiently.

Result: Achieves comparable/better accuracy than Transformers while significantly reducing memory usage on 13 benchmarks.

Conclusion: DB2-TransF provides a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires models that can efficiently capture complex temporal dependencies, especially in large-scale and high-dimensional settings. While Transformer-based architectures excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity poses limitations on scalability and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DB2-TransF, a novel Transformer-inspired architecture that replaces the self-attention mechanism with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer. This wavelet-based module efficiently captures multi-scale local and global patterns and enhances the modeling of correlations across multiple time series for the time series forecasting task. Extensive experiments on 13 standard forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy to conventional Transformers, while substantially reducing memory usage for the time series forecasting task. The obtained experimental results position DB2-TransF as a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

TL;DR: SoTra introduces soft-token trajectory forecasting with risk-aware decoding to mitigate exposure bias in clinical time series forecasting, reducing clinical risk by 15-18% in glucose and blood pressure applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard autoregressive models trained with teacher forcing suffer from exposure bias, leading to unstable multi-step forecasts that are unsuitable for safety-critical predictive control in clinical settings.

Method: Soft-Token Trajectory Forecasting (SoTra) propagates continuous probability distributions (soft tokens) to mitigate exposure bias and learn calibrated, uncertainty-aware trajectories, combined with a risk-aware decoding module that minimizes expected clinical harm.

Result: In glucose forecasting, SoTra reduces average zone-based risk by 18%; in blood-pressure forecasting, it lowers effective clinical risk by approximately 15%.

Conclusion: SoTra demonstrates significant risk reduction in clinical forecasting applications, supporting its use in safety-critical predictive control systems for diabetes and hemodynamic management.

Abstract: Autoregressive forecasting is central to predictive control in diabetes and hemodynamic management, where different operating zones carry different clinical risks. Standard models trained with teacher forcing suffer from exposure bias, yielding unstable multi-step forecasts for closed-loop use. We introduce Soft-Token Trajectory Forecasting (SoTra), which propagates continuous probability distributions (``soft tokens'') to mitigate exposure bias and learn calibrated, uncertainty-aware trajectories. A risk-aware decoding module then minimizes expected clinical harm. In glucose forecasting, SoTra reduces average zone-based risk by 18\%; in blood-pressure forecasting, it lowers effective clinical risk by approximately 15\%. These improvements support its use in safety-critical predictive control.

Conclusion: Graph-based propagation through Text2Graph achieves sustainable text classification with competitive results at reduced environmental cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become effective zero-shot classifiers, but their high computational requirements and environmental costs limit their practicality for large-scale annotation in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. To support more sustainable workflows, we present \textsc{Text2Graph}, an open-source Python package that provides a modular implementation of existing text-to-graph classification approaches. The framework enables users to combine LLM-based partial annotation with Graph Neural Network (GNN) label propagation in a flexible manner, making it straightforward to swap components such as feature extractors, edge construction methods, and sampling strategies. We benchmark \textsc{Text2Graph} on a zero-shot setting using five datasets spanning topic classification and sentiment analysis tasks, comparing multiple variants against other zero-shot approaches for text classification. In addition to reporting performance, we provide detailed estimates of energy consumption and carbon emissions, showing that graph-based propagation achieves competitive results at a fraction of the energy and environmental cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: address fundamental challenges in medical AI including domain shifts, rare-class conditions, lack of transparency, and bias against infrequent pathologies

Method: integrates deep vision models with clinician-derived expert knowledge using symbolic components as clinical priors and regularizers

Result: 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization, 10% improvement in F1 score for rare class, substantial outperformance of deep learning baselines

Conclusion: MedXAI delivers clinically aligned explanations while achieving superior in-domain and cross-domain performance, particularly for rare diseases in multimodal medical AI.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a fundamental challenge in medical AI, particularly un- der domain shifts and rare-class conditions. Deep learning mod- els often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Med- ical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician- derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare- class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading. Ex periments on ten multicenter datasets show consistent gains, including a 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and a 10% improvmnet in F1 score of rare class, substantially outperforming strong deep learning baselines. Ablations confirm that the symbolic components act as effective clinical priors and regularizers, improving robustness under distribution shift. MedXAI delivers clinically aligned explanations while achieving superior in-domain and cross-domain performance, particularly for rare diseases in multimodal medical AI.

*Sangli Teng,Hang Liu,Jingyu Song,Koushil Sreenath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CHyLL learns continuous neural representations of hybrid systems without segmentation by reformulating state space as a quotient manifold


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with mode switching and flow discontinuities in hybrid systems

Method: Learns singularity-free neural embedding and continuous flow simultaneously using differential topology

Result: Accurately predicts flows, identifies topological invariants, and applies to optimal control

Conclusion: CHyLL provides superior continuous representation of hybrid systems without explicit mode switching

Abstract: Learning the flows of hybrid systems that have both continuous and discrete time dynamics is challenging. The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems. Finally, we apply CHyLL to the stochastic optimal control problem.

TL;DR: A novel entropy estimator for small data sets that combines decomposability with unseen outcome estimation to reduce bias


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable entropy estimation from undersampled data where number of examples may be smaller than possible outcomes

Method: Uses decomposability property combined with missing mass and unseen outcome estimation to compensate for negative bias

Result: Outperforms classical estimators in undersampled regimes and comparable to state-of-the-art methods

Conclusion: Proposed estimator effectively addresses bias in small-sample entropy estimation

Abstract: Reliable data-driven estimation of Shannon entropy from small data sets, where the number of examples is potentially smaller than the number of possible outcomes, is a critical matter in several applications. In this paper, we introduce a discrete entropy estimator, where we use the decomposability property in combination with estimations of the missing mass and the number of unseen outcomes to compensate for the negative bias induced by them. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms some classical estimators in undersampled regimes, and performs comparably with some well-established state-of-the-art estimators.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome sparsity and computational complexity in traditional feature engineering, and to address the underperformance of deep learning models on tabular biological data, a more effective representation method for molecular sequences is needed.

Method: The method transforms molecular sequences into images using Chaos Game Representation (CGR) for 2D mapping, followed by Rips complex construction to capture both local and global topological features from pairwise distances.

Result: The proposed method achieves 86.8% accuracy on breast cancer datasets and 94.5% on lung cancer datasets, outperforming vector-based, sequence language models, and existing image-based approaches.

Conclusion: The introduction of a topological approach for molecular sequence analysis effectively addresses the limitations of traditional feature engineering and deep learning methods, resulting in a more robust framework for molecular sequence classification.

Abstract: Traditional feature engineering approaches for molecular sequence classification suffer from sparsity issues and computational complexity, while deep learning models often underperform on tabular biological data. This paper introduces a novel topological approach that transforms molecular sequences into images by combining Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with Rips complex construction from algebraic topology. Our method maps sequence elements to 2D coordinates via CGR, computes pairwise distances, and constructs Rips complexes to capture both local structural and global topological features. We provide formal guarantees on representation uniqueness, topological stability, and information preservation. Extensive experiments on anticancer peptide datasets demonstrate superior performance over vector-based, sequence language models, and existing image-based methods, achieving 86.8\% and 94.5\% accuracy on breast and lung cancer datasets, respectively. The topological representation preserves critical sequence information while enabling effective utilization of vision-based deep learning architectures for molecular sequence analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: New scalable hashing-based embedding method for SARS-CoV-2 spike sequences enables faster (up to 99.81% time reduction) and accurate (86.4% accuracy) lineage classification compared to existing approaches, addressing computational bottlenecks in large-scale viral sequence analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection and characterization of COVID-19 are critical for effective clinical response and public health planning, but existing approaches face scalability limitations, high computational costs, and suboptimal performance for large sequence datasets.

Method: A scalable embedding method using hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike protein sequences, which are then used to train machine learning models for supervised lineage classification.

Result: The proposed embeddings achieved up to 86.4% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed embedding method offers a fast, efficient, and scalable solution for large-scale viral sequence analysis, achieving comparable classification accuracy with dramatic reductions in computational time.

Abstract: Early detection and characterization of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, remain critical for effective clinical response and public-health planning. The global availability of large-scale viral sequence data presents significant opportunities for computational analysis; however, existing approaches face notable limitations. Phylogenetic tree-based methods are computationally intensive and do not scale efficiently to today's multi-million-sequence datasets. Similarly, current embedding-based techniques often rely on aligned sequences or exhibit suboptimal predictive performance and high runtime costs, creating barriers to practical large-scale analysis. In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences. These embeddings are subsequently used to train a variety of machine learning models for supervised lineage classification. We conduct an extensive evaluation comparing our approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art biological sequence embedding methods across diverse metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings offer substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving up to 86.4\% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81\%. This highlights the method's potential as a fast, effective, and scalable solution for large-scale viral sequence analysis.

### [72] [Rethinking Causal Discovery Through the Lens of Exchangeability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10152)
*Tiago Brogueira,Mário Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reframes i.i.d. causal discovery in terms of the more general exchangeability assumption, showing through conceptual and empirical arguments that many existing methods rely on exchangeability. It introduces a synthetic dataset enforcing only exchangeability, which better mirrors real-world data structure, and demonstrates its predictive capability with a neural-based algorithm performing competitively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery methods are developed under distinct i.i.d. and timeseries regimes, but the i.i.d. setting should be reframed using exchangeability—a more general symmetry principle—to better align with real-world data assumptions and improve methodological foundations.

Method: The authors present a conceptual argument linking experimental causal inference's reliance on exchangeability to causal discovery, and an empirical analysis showing existing i.i.d. methods and benchmarks (e.g., Tübingen dataset) rely on exchangeability. They create a synthetic dataset enforcing only exchangeability (not i.i.d.) and train a neural-network-based causal discovery algorithm on it.

Result: The exchangeable synthetic dataset mirrors the statistical structure of the real-world Tübingen dataset more closely than i.i.d. synthetic datasets. The proposed neural algorithm, trained solely on this dataset, performs similarly to state-of-the-art i.i.d. methods on the real-world benchmark.

Conclusion: Reframing i.i.d. causal discovery under exchangeability is conceptually and empirically justified, leading to more realistic synthetic data and competitive algorithms, suggesting exchangeability should replace i.i.d. as a foundational assumption in causal discovery.

Abstract: Causal discovery methods have traditionally been developed under two distinct regimes: independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and timeseries data, each governed by separate modelling assumptions. In this paper, we argue that the i.i.d. setting can and should be reframed in terms of exchangeability, a strictly more general symmetry principle. We present the implications of this reframing, alongside two core arguments: (1) a conceptual argument, based on extending the dependency of experimental causal inference on exchangeability to causal discovery; and (2) an empirical argument, showing that many existing i.i.d. causal-discovery methods are predicated on exchangeability assumptions, and that the sole extensive widely-used real-world "i.i.d." benchmark (the Tübingen dataset) consists mainly of exchangeable (and not i.i.d.) examples. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset that enforces only the exchangeability assumption, without imposing the stronger i.i.d. assumption. We show that our exchangeable synthetic dataset mirrors the statistical structure of the real-world "i.i.d." dataset more closely than all other i.i.d. synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the predictive capability of this dataset by proposing a neural-network-based causal-discovery algorithm trained exclusively on our synthetic dataset, and which performs similarly to other state-of-the-art i.i.d. methods on the real-world benchmark.

*Keito Inoshita,Xiaokang Zhou,Akira Kawai,Katsutoshi Yada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIEGAD is a novel data augmentation framework using cluster conditioning and hierarchical allocation to systematically fill semantically uncovered regions in imbalanced datasets, with interpolative/extrapolative synthesis and quality control via geometry constraints and LLM-as-a-Judge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses challenges in deep learning deployment where scarce data and imbalanced label distributions lead to semantically uncovered regions in real-world data distributions, causing misclassification near class boundaries and unstable model behaviors in peripheral areas. Although LLMs show potential for data augmentation, there's a lack of integrated frameworks achieving directional generation control, domain alignment, and quality assurance simultaneously.

Method: The approach constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation via a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation method (integrating class frequency and geometric indicators), and uses both interpolative and extrapolative synthesis for directional generation control, with quality monitoring through geometry-constrained filtering and an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism.

Result: Experiments on multiple classification tasks show that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real data with semantic diversity. For long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, it consistently improves F1 scores and recall, validating the balanced achievement of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality.

Conclusion: The paper presents CIEGAD as an effective and practically oriented data augmentation framework that complements semantically uncovered regions while maintaining strong alignment with real-world data distributions, with demonstrated improvements in classification performance.

Abstract: In practical deep learning deployment, the scarcity of data and the imbalance of label distributions often lead to semantically uncovered regions within the real-world data distribution, hindering model training and causing misclassification near class boundaries as well as unstable behaviors in peripheral areas. Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality. These results indicate that CIEGAD serves as a practically oriented data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving alignment with real-world data.

Motivation: HD-sEMG provides noninvasive neural interface but mapping neural activity to motor intent remains challenging.

Method: Assessed SNN vs TCN for decoding fingertip force from motor-unit firing derived from HD-sEMG using FastICA decomposition and end-to-end causal convolutions.

Result: TCN achieved 4.44% MVC RMSE (r=0.974) while SNN achieved 8.25% MVC (r=0.922) on held-out trials.

Conclusion: TCN was more accurate but SNN represents a realistic neuromorphic baseline that could close performance gap with architectural refinements.

Abstract: High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) provides a noninvasive neural interface for assistive and rehabilitation control, but mapping neural activity to user motor intent remains challenging. We assess a spiking neural network (SNN) as a neuromorphic architecture against a temporal convolutional network (TCN) for decoding fingertip force from motor-unit (MU) firing derived from HD-sEMG. Data were collected from a single participant (10 trials) with two forearm electrode arrays; MU activity was obtained via FastICA-based decomposition, and models were trained on overlapping windows with end-to-end causal convolutions. On held-out trials, the TCN achieved 4.44% MVC RMSE (Pearson r = 0.974) while the SNN achieved 8.25% MVC (r = 0.922). While the TCN was more accurate, we view the SNN as a realistic neuromorphic baseline that could close much of this gap with modest architectural and hyperparameter refinements.

TL;DR: MiniF2F-Dafny translates the mathematical reasoning benchmark miniF2F to the Dafny automated theorem prover. Dafny's automation verifies about 40-45% of problems with empty proofs, and LLMs provide hints for the rest, achieving 55.7% success with iterative correction.


<details>

Motivation: To adapt the miniF2F benchmark from interactive theorem provers to an automated one (Dafny) and explore the synergy between LLMs and automation for mathematical reasoning.

Method: Translate miniF2F to Dafny, evaluate Dafny's automation on verifying problems with empty proofs, and test 12 LLMs for providing proof hints where automation fails, using iterative error correction.

Result: Dafny verifies 99/244 (40.6%) test and 109/244 (44.7%) validation problems with empty proofs. The best LLM achieves 55.7% pass@4 success rate with hints.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective collaboration: LLMs offer high-level guidance while automation handles low-level details, with the benchmark available on GitHub.

Abstract: We present miniF2F-Dafny, the first translation of the mathematical reasoning benchmark miniF2F to an automated theorem prover: Dafny. Previously, the benchmark existed only in interactive theorem provers (Lean, Isabelle, HOL Light, Metamath). We find that Dafny's automation verifies 99/244 (40.6%) of the test set and 109/244 (44.7%) of the validation set with empty proofs--requiring no manual proof steps. For problems where empty proofs fail, we evaluate 12 off-the-shelf LLMs on providing proof hints. The best model we test achieves 55.7% pass@4 success rate employing iterative error correction. These preliminary results highlight an effective division of labor: LLMs provide high-level guidance while automation handles low-level details. Our benchmark can be found on GitHub at http://github.com/dafny-lang/miniF2F .

*Hao Shu,Jicheng Li,Yu Jin,Ling Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes LRTC-TIDT, a Hankel tensor completion method using temporal isometric delay-embedding to achieve exact recovery for non-random missing data in time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-random missing data threatens reliability of time series analysis; existing tensor completion methods lack clear low-rankness justification and exact recovery theory for non-random patterns.

Method: Uses temporal isometric delay-embedding transform to construct Hankel tensor with natural low-rankness from time series smoothness/periodicity; applies t-SVD framework for low-rank completion.

Result: Exact recovery proven under non-random sampling conditions; outperforms existing methods in simulations and real-world tasks like network flow, traffic, and temperature prediction.

Conclusion: LRTC-TIDT provides theoretically justified exact recovery for non-random missing patterns, advancing multidimensional time series analysis reliability.

Abstract: Non-random missing data is a ubiquitous yet undertreated flaw in multidimensional time series, fundamentally threatening the reliability of data-driven analysis and decision-making. Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoShu2000/LRTC-TIDT.

*Ragja Palakkadavath,Hung Le,Thanh Nguyen-Tang,Svetha Venkatesh,Sunil Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDG method improves federated learning generalization while protecting privacy through latent space inversion and important weight aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FedDG methods compromise privacy by sharing client data statistics when trying to improve global model generalization.

Method: Uses latent space inversion for domain invariance in local training and important weight aggregation strategy for model combination.

Result: Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods with reduced communication overhead in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses privacy concerns in FedDG while maintaining strong generalization capability.

Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) addresses distribution shifts among clients in a federated learning framework. FedDG methods aggregate the parameters of locally trained client models to form a global model that generalizes to unseen clients while preserving data privacy. While improving the generalization capability of the global model, many existing approaches in FedDG jeopardize privacy by sharing statistics of client data between themselves. Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy. When clients are not \emph{i.i.d}, aggregating their local models may discard certain local adaptations. To overcome this, we propose an \textbf{important weight} aggregation strategy to prioritize parameters that significantly influence predictions of local models during aggregation. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods with less communication overhead.

TL;DR: A new multimodal time series forecasting framework (AIR) uses text data to dynamically control how time series information is combined, not just as additional features. Combined with an LLM-based text refinement pipeline, it improves forecasting accuracy on real-world market data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series forecasting relies primarily on historical data, which is often insufficient for accurate predictions due to limited information in practical scenarios. Multimodal methods incorporating additional data modalities (especially text) have been explored, but existing approaches treat text as interchangeable features rather than using it to dynamically guide model behavior.

Method: 1. An Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework that leverages text data to dynamically control how multivariate time series information should be combined, rather than treating text as interchangeable auxiliary features. 2. A text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model (LLM) to convert raw text data into suitable formats for multimodal forecasting. 3. A new benchmark for multimodal forecasting experiments based on this refined pipeline.

Result: Experiments with real-world market data (crude oil prices, exchange rates) show that AIR effectively modulates time series model behavior using textual inputs. This significantly enhances forecasting accuracy across various time series forecasting tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The AIR framework demonstrates significant potential in advancing multimodal time series forecasting by effectively utilizing textual information to guide time series models. By moving beyond traditional feature-level integration and instead using text to control information routing, AIR improves forecasting accuracy across various real-world financial markets.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical task for artificial intelligence with numerous real-world applications. Traditional approaches primarily rely on historical time series data to predict the future values. However, in practical scenarios, this is often insufficient for accurate predictions due to the limited information available. To address this challenge, multimodal time series forecasting methods which incorporate additional data modalities, mainly text data, alongside time series data have been explored. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline. Experiment results with the real world market data such as crude oil price and exchange rates demonstrate that AIR effectively modulates the behavior of the time series model using textual inputs, significantly enhancing forecasting accuracy in various time series forecasting tasks.

*Duo Wang,Xinming Wang,Chao Wang,Xiaowei Yue,Jianguo Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGPs struggle with heterogeneous inputs, ignoring physics, and negative transfer. We propose a double-regularized heterogeneous GP that aligns inputs, incorporates physical insights, and adaptively selects sources via CVAE and sparsity penalty, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MGPs have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning, but they face key challenges: (1) source and target domains are often heterogeneous, making direct transfer difficult; (2) prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored, hampering domain insights and causing unstable mappings; (3) inappropriate sharing among target and sources leads to negative transfer; (4) traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified manner

Method: propose Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP): (1) trainable prior probability mapping to align heterogeneous inputs, (2) build multi-source transfer GP on latent aligned inputs, (3) integrate the structure into a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework, (4) incorporate physical insights as regularization to align with known physics, (5) impose sparsity penalty on transfer coefficients to select informative sources and suppress negative transfer

Result: extensive simulations and real-world engineering case studies validate the effectiveness of R^2-HGP, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics

Conclusion: R^2-HGP is a unified approach that effectively tackles the key challenges of heterogeneous transfer learning with MGPs: input domain heterogeneity, ignorance of physical insights, and negative transfer. It robustly integrates domain alignment, physical regularization, and adaptive source selection to consistently outperform existing methods across diverse metrics and scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework. Physical insights is further incorporated as a regularization term to ensure that the alignment results adhere to known physical knowledge. Next, within the multi-source transfer GP model, a sparsity penalty is imposed on the transfer coefficients, enabling the model to adaptively select the most informative source outputs and suppress negative transfer. Extensive simulations and real-world engineering case studies validate the effectiveness of our R^2-HGP, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: KHRONOS surrogate model combines sparse high-fidelity and low-fidelity data for fast airflow prediction with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need faster alternatives to costly aerodynamic simulations while maintaining accuracy under computational constraints.

Method: Uses variational principles, interpolation theory, tensor decomposition for parameter pruning. Compares with MLP, GNN, PINN using AirfRANS dataset.

Result: KHRONOS achieves comparable accuracy but with significantly fewer parameters and faster computation, especially with limited high-fidelity data.

Conclusion: KHRONOS effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic prediction.

Abstract: Surrogate models provide fast alternatives to costly aerodynamic simulations and are extremely useful in design and optimization applications. This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of KHRONOS and similar architectures to balance accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction.

*Vasiliki Stoumpou,Maciej Tysarowski,Talhat Azemi,Jawad Haider,Howard L. Haronian,Robert C. Hagberg,Dimitris Bertsimas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Interpretable prescriptive framework using Optimal Policy Trees provides individualized TAVR vs SAVR recommendations for aortic stenosis patients, reducing estimated 5-year mortality by 20.3% and 13.8% at two hospitals compared to clinical practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between SAVR and TAVR remains variable in clinical practice. While existing models predict postprocedural risk, there is a lack of interpretable, individualized treatment recommendations that directly optimize long-term outcomes.

Method: The authors introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework combining prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and Optimal Policy Trees (OPT). They use data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting, estimate counterfactual mortality outcomes for both SAVR and TAVR, and train a policy model that partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups to prescribe optimal treatment.

Result: If the OPT prescriptions were applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3% in Hartford and 13.8% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, demonstrating promising generalizability. The learned decision boundaries aligned with real-world outcomes and clinical observations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed interpretable prescriptive framework is the first to provide transparent, data-driven recommendations for TAVR versus SAVR that can improve estimated long-term outcomes. The OPT-based approach shows promising generalizability across different institutions and offers a more systematic, evidence-based approach to precision medicine in structural heart disease.

Abstract: Background. Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences. While existing models predict postprocedural risk, there is a lack of interpretable, individualized treatment recommendations that directly optimize long-term outcomes.
  Methods. We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk.
  Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\% in Hartford and 13.8\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution. The learned decision boundaries aligned with real-world outcomes and clinical observations.
  Interpretation. Our interpretable prescriptive framework is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide transparent, data-driven recommendations for TAVR versus SAVR that improve estimated long-term outcomes both in an internal and external cohort, while remaining clinically grounded and contributing toward a more systematic and evidence-based approach to precision medicine in structural heart disease.

### [83] [Dynamics of Agentic Loops in Large Language Models: A Geometric Theory of Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10350)
*Nicolas Tacheny*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduction of a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems with identified contractive and exploratory regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The geometric behavior of agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit complex dynamics) remains poorly understood despite their importance in LLM-based systems.

Method: Geometric framework distinguishing artifact space from embedding space, using isotonic calibration to eliminate cosine similarity bias, and controlled experiments on singular agentic loops.

Result: Identified two fundamental regimes: contractive rewriting loops that converge toward stable attractors, and exploratory summarize-negate loops that produce unbounded divergence with distinct geometric signatures.

Conclusion: Prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of agentic loops, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.

Abstract: Agentic systems built on large language models operate through recursive feedback loops, where each output becomes the next input. Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.

*Vijay Prakash S*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper simplifies ferromagnetic magnetization using straight lines continued fraction for nonlinear behavior analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To physically explain magnetization nonlinearity caused by magnetic domain alignment with external fields.

Method: Approximating magnetization nonlinearity as a continued fraction of straight lines, analyzed via nonlinear regression.

Result: The model interprets nonlinear behavior in both growing and shrinking magnetic domains.

Conclusion: Straight lines continued fraction provides effective parameter estimation for ferromagnetic magnetization nonlinearity.

Abstract: Magnetization of a ferromagnetic substance in response to an externally applied magnetic field increases with the strength of the field. This is because at the microscopic level, magnetic moments in certain regions or domains of the substance increasingly align with the applied field, while the amount of misaligned domains decreases. The alignment of such magnetic domains with an applied magnetic field forms the physical basis for the nonlinearity of magnetization. In this paper, the nonlinear function is approximated as a combination of continued fraction of straight lines. The resulting fit is used to interpret the nonlinear behavior in both growing and shrinking magnetic domains. The continued fraction of straight lines used here is an algebraic expression which can be used to estimate parameters using nonlinear regression.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Eminence, an explainable black-box backdoor framework with theoretical guarantees that achieves effective attacks with exceptionally low poison rates (<0.1%) by strategically exploiting sparse decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current backdoor attacks rely on heuristic methods with limited theoretical understanding, constraining attack predictability and adaptability.

Method: The authors conduct theoretical analysis of sparse decision boundaries, derive closed-form ambiguous regions, and develop Eminence framework that optimizes subtle triggers to exploit vulnerable boundaries.

Result: Eminence achieves >90% attack success rate with <0.1% poison rate, negligible clean-accuracy loss, and high transferability across models and datasets.

Conclusion: The work provides rigorous theoretical foundations for backdoor attacks and demonstrates that strategic margin poisoning can achieve exponential boundary manipulation effects.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) underpin critical applications yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, typically reliant on heuristic brute-force methods. Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation. Eminence maintains > 90% attack success rate, exhibits negligible clean-accuracy loss, and demonstrates high transferability across diverse models, datasets and scenarios.

*Yizhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a unified operator-theoretic framework describing neural training dynamics through gradient descent, showing that training preserves functional regularity and leads to spectral transport-dissipation PDE with self-similar solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks operate in finite-regularity regimes with heavy-tailed spectra and basis drift, requiring a rigorous mathematical framework to unify training dynamics.

Method: Derived exact evolution equations from gradient descent, applied Kato perturbation theory to get coupled mode ODEs, coarse-grained to spectral transport-dissipation PDE, analyzed weak-coupling regime solutions.

Result: Obtained asymptotic power-law drift form, self-similar PDE solutions with resolution frontier and polynomial growth, derived scaling-law exponents explaining double descent geometry, showed NTK and feature learning as PDE limits.

Conclusion: Provides unified spectral framework connecting operator geometry, optimization dynamics, and universal scaling behavior in deep networks, explaining key phenomena like double descent.

Abstract: Modern deep networks operate in a rough, finite-regularity regime where Jacobian-induced operators exhibit heavy-tailed spectra and strong basis drift. In this work, we derive a unified operator-theoretoretic description of neural training dynamics directly from gradient descent. Starting from the exact evolution $\dot e_t = -M(t)e_t$ in function space, we apply Kato perturbation theory to obtain a rigorous system of coupled mode ODEs and show that, after coarse-graining, these dynamics converge to a spectral transport--dissipation PDE \[ \partial_t g + \partial_λ(v g) = -λg + S, \] where $v$ captures eigenbasis drift and $S$ encodes nonlocal spectral coupling.
  We prove that neural training preserves functional regularity, forcing the drift to take an asymptotic power-law form $v(λ,t)\sim -c(t)λ^b$. In the weak-coupling regime -- naturally induced by spectral locality and SGD noise -- the PDE admits self-similar solutions with a resolution frontier, polynomial amplitude growth, and power-law dissipation. This structure yields explicit scaling-law exponents, explains the geometry of double descent, and shows that the effective training time satisfies $τ(t)=t^αL(t)$ for slowly varying $L$.
  Finally, we show that NTK training and feature learning arise as two limits of the same PDE: $v\equiv 0$ recovers lazy dynamics, while $v\neq 0$ produces representation drift. Our results provide a unified spectral framework connecting operator geometry, optimization dynamics, and the universal scaling behavior of modern deep networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates AI metacognition - whether deep learning models truly know what they know - and introduces meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity. The framework enables test-time model selection via a bandit-based arbiter that improves joint-inference accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human cognition exhibits metacognition (ability to assess one's own knowledge reliability), while deep learning models often show poor calibration where confidence doesn't reflect true competence. The paper addresses whether models truly know what they know.

Method: Proposes meta-d' as a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity to characterize how reliably a model's confidence predicts its accuracy. Uses this sensitivity score with a bandit-based arbiter for test-time model selection among multiple expert models.

Result: Experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models.

Conclusion: Provides a novel behavioral account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity).

Abstract: A key aspect of human cognition is metacognition - the ability to assess one's own knowledge and judgment reliability. While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task. Our experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models. This work provides a novel behavioural account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as a problem of evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity).

TL;DR: A hybrid physics-ML framework using GPR for accurate water flux prediction in forward osmosis with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FO models face challenges with parameter variability and lack of physical consistency/uncertainty quantification in data-driven approaches.

Method: GPR trained on residual error between physical model prediction and experimental data, with decomposition of predictive variance into model and input uncertainties.

Result: Achieved MAPE of 0.26% and R² of 0.999 on test data with only 120 training points.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust surrogate model for FO process optimization and digital twin development.

Abstract: Forward Osmosis (FO) is a promising low-energy membrane separation technology, but challenges in accurately modelling its water flux (Jw) persist due to complex internal mass transfer phenomena. Traditional mechanistic models struggle with empirical parameter variability, while purely data-driven models lack physical consistency and rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ). This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual). Crucially, we implement a full UQ methodology by decomposing the total predictive variance (sigma2_total) into model uncertainty (epistemic, from GPR's posterior variance) and input uncertainty (aleatoric, analytically propagated via the Delta method for multi-variate correlated inputs). Leveraging the inherent strength of GPR in low-data regimes, the model, trained on a meagre 120 data points, achieved a state-of-the-art Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.26% and an R2 of 0.999 on the independent test data, validating a truly robust and reliable surrogate model for advanced FO process optimization and digital twin development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from high complexity or restrictive assumptions.

Method: Transforms mixed constraints into pure inequalities via null space transformation, uses SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to original space.

Result: Achieves 4.27ms/item inference with 0.0025% optimality gap and 25x speedup over pandapower solver while maintaining zero constraint violations.

Conclusion: T-SKM-Net enables efficient neural network constraint satisfaction with theoretical guarantees and practical superiority.

Abstract: Neural network constraint satisfaction is crucial for safety-critical applications such as power system optimization, robotic path planning, and autonomous driving. However, existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from either high computational complexity or restrictive assumptions on constraint structures. The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction. The framework transforms mixed constraint problems into pure inequality problems through null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space, efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints. We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation. On the DCOPF case118 benchmark, our method achieves 4.27ms/item GPU serial forward inference with 0.0025% max optimality gap with post-processing mode and 5.25ms/item with 0.0008% max optimality gap with joint training mode, delivering over 25$\times$ speedup compared to the pandapower solver while maintaining zero constraint violations under given tolerance.

*Jiaxi Wu,Tiantian Zhang,Yuxing Wang,Yongzhe Chang,Xueqian Wang*

TL;DR: UACER enhances robust adversarial RL via critic ensemble and uncertainty-aware aggregation to tackle training instability from non-stationary adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust adversarial RL faces challenges with non-stationarity induced by trainable adversaries, leading to training instability and convergence difficulties in high-dimensional environments.

Method: Proposes UACER with two key strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble utilizing multiple parallel critics to stabilize Q-value estimation, and 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism using variance-derived Q-value aggregation with epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on MuJoCo control problems show UACER outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance, stability, and efficiency.

Conclusion: UACER achieves state-of-the-art performance in robust adversarial reinforcement learning, addressing key challenges of non-stationarity and training instability through integrated critic ensemble and uncertainty-aware mechanisms.

Abstract: Robust adversarial reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective paradigm for training agents to handle uncertain disturbance in real environments, with critical applications in sequential decision-making domains such as autonomous driving and robotic control. Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process. Comprehensive experiments across several MuJoCo control problems validate the superior effectiveness of UACER, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall performance, stability, and efficiency.

*Chihyeon Song,Jaewoo Lee,Jinkyoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARB is a learning-free adaptive replay buffer that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on 'on-policyness' to balance offline dataset usage with online experiences in O2O RL, improving both early stability and final performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard O2O RL methods with fixed data-mixing ratios struggle to balance early learning stability and asymptotic performance, creating a critical dilemma in managing offline datasets and online experiences.

Method: ARB uses a lightweight 'on-policyness' metric to assess trajectory alignment with current policy behavior, assigning proportional sampling weights to transitions. It's learning-free, simple to implement, and integrates seamlessly into existing O2O RL algorithms.

Result: Extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks show ARB consistently mitigates early performance degradation and significantly improves final performance across various O2O RL algorithms.

Conclusion: ARB demonstrates the importance of adaptive, behavior-aware replay buffer design in O2O RL, effectively leveraging offline data for stability while progressively focusing on relevant online experiences for better performance.

Abstract: Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) faces a critical dilemma in balancing the use of a fixed offline dataset with newly collected online experiences. Standard methods, often relying on a fixed data-mixing ratio, struggle to manage the trade-off between early learning stability and asymptotic performance. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences. Our extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that ARB consistently mitigates early performance degradation and significantly improves the final performance of various O2O RL algorithms, highlighting the importance of an adaptive, behavior-aware replay buffer design.

TL;DR: Proposes DDE framework using VAE disentangled latent space for efficient OOD reasoning on resource-constrained devices


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to deploy multi-label OOD reasoning models on resource-limited devices while preserving disentanglement properties

Method: Student-teacher distillation formalized as constrained optimization with disentanglement constraints

Result: Theoretical guarantees established using Rademacher complexity; empirical evaluation on NVIDIA hardware

Conclusion: DDE successfully compresses models while maintaining disentanglement for OOD reasoning

Abstract: Recently, the disentangled latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE) has been used to reason about multi-label out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples that are derived from different distributions than training samples. Disentangled latent space means having one-to-many maps between latent dimensions and generative factors or important characteristics of an image. This paper proposes a disentangled distilled encoder (DDE) framework to decrease the OOD reasoner size for deployment on resource-constrained devices while preserving disentanglement. DDE formalizes student-teacher distillation for model compression as a constrained optimization problem while preserving disentanglement with disentanglement constraints. Theoretical guarantees for disentanglement during distillation based on Rademacher complexity are established. The approach is evaluated empirically by deploying the compressed model on an NVIDIA

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes VML method for solving inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models without task-specific training


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods rely on approximations and are computationally demanding

Method: Variational mode-seeking loss (VML) derived from minimizing KL divergence between diffusion and measurement posteriors

Result: VML-MAP algorithm shows improved performance and computational efficiency on image restoration tasks

Conclusion: VML provides analytic solution for linear inverse problems and outperforms existing methods across datasets

Abstract: A pre-trained unconditional diffusion model, combined with posterior sampling or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation techniques, can solve arbitrary inverse problems without task-specific training or fine-tuning. However, existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods often rely on modeling approximations and can be computationally demanding. In this work, we propose the variational mode-seeking loss (VML), which, when minimized during each reverse diffusion step, guides the generated sample towards the MAP estimate. VML arises from a novel perspective of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{x}_t)$ and the measurement posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{y})$, where $\mathbf{y}$ denotes the measurement. Importantly, for linear inverse problems, VML can be analytically derived and need not be approximated. Based on further theoretical insights, we propose VML-MAP, an empirically effective algorithm for solving inverse problems, and validate its efficacy over existing methods in both performance and computational time, through extensive experiments on diverse image-restoration tasks across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: STA-Attention framework uses Top-K Sparse Autoencoders to decompose KV cache into semantic atoms, revealing Key-Value asymmetry and enabling efficient memory optimization while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The KV cache is the primary memory bottleneck in long-context LLMs, but is typically treated as an opaque numerical tensor without interpretability.

Method: Proposes Top-K Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose KV cache into interpretable semantic atoms, eliminating shrinkage bias of standard L1-regularized SAEs. Introduces Dual-Budget Strategy based on discovered Key-Value asymmetry.

Result: Experiments on Yi-6B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-32B show semantic reconstructions maintain perplexity and zero-shot performance comparable to original models.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap between mechanistic interpretability and faithful attention modeling, enabling interpretable KV cache decomposition while preserving performance.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is the primary memory bottleneck in long-context Large Language Models, yet it is typically treated as an opaque numerical tensor. In this work, we propose \textbf{STA-Attention}, a framework that utilizes Top-K Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose the KV cache into interpretable ``semantic atoms.'' Unlike standard $L_1$-regularized SAEs, our Top-K approach eliminates shrinkage bias, preserving the precise dot-product geometry required for attention. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental \textbf{Key-Value Asymmetry}: while Key vectors serve as highly sparse routers dominated by a ``Semantic Elbow,'' deep Value vectors carry dense content payloads requiring a larger budget. Based on this structure, we introduce a Dual-Budget Strategy that selectively preserves the most informative semantic components while filtering representational noise. Experiments on Yi-6B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-32B, and others show that our semantic reconstructions maintain perplexity and zero-shot performance comparable to the original models, effectively bridging the gap between mechanistic interpretability and faithful attention modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard IB methods degrade significantly under label noise due to strong reliance on accurate labels.

Method: Proposes MSC criterion with mutual information regularizer, noise-aware latent disentanglement, and three-phase training framework (Warmup, Knowledge Injection, Robust Training).

Result: Theoretically proves noise invariance and separation of clean/noisy information; experimentally shows superior robustness and efficiency under label noise.

Conclusion: LaT-IB significantly enhances robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise.

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle facilitates effective representation learning by preserving label-relevant information while compressing irrelevant information. However, its strong reliance on accurate labels makes it inherently vulnerable to label noise, prevalent in real-world scenarios, resulting in significant performance degradation and overfitting. To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a "Minimal-Sufficient-Clean" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space. Theoretically, we first derive mutual information bounds for each component of our objective including prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and moreover prove that optimizing it encourages representations invariant to input noise and separates clean and noisy label information. Furthermore, we design a three-phase training framework: Warmup, Knowledge Injection and Robust Training, to progressively guide the model toward noise-resistant representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaT-IB achieves superior robustness and efficiency under label noise, significantly enhancing robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise.

Conclusion: THeGAU framework effectively addresses HGNN limitations through joint type preservation and structure refinement, demonstrating superior performance across multiple backbones.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are effective for modeling Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), which encode complex multi-typed entities and relations. However, HGNNs often suffer from type information loss and structural noise, limiting their representational fidelity and generalization. We propose THeGAU, a model-agnostic framework that combines a type-aware graph autoencoder with guided graph augmentation to improve node classification. THeGAU reconstructs schema-valid edges as an auxiliary task to preserve node-type semantics and introduces a decoder-driven augmentation mechanism to selectively refine noisy structures. This joint design enhances robustness, accuracy, and efficiency while significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three benchmark HIN datasets (IMDB, ACM, and DBLP) demonstrate that THeGAU consistently outperforms existing HGNN methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple backbones.

Motivation: To advance constrained reinforcement learning across different domains including control problems, human preference learning, and alignment of large-scale AI models.

Method: Develops multiple algorithms: ACPO for average-cost CMDPs, e-COP for episodic CMDPs, warmPref-PS for preference-based bandits, PSPL for preference-based RL, and MOPO for language model alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees across various constrained RL settings, providing scalable tools for safe and aligned decision-making.

Conclusion: The thesis successfully unifies constrained RL across average-cost, episodic, and preference-driven paradigms, delivering both theoretical advances and practical algorithms for real-world applications.

Abstract: This thesis develops theoretical frameworks and algorithms that advance constrained reinforcement learning (RL) across control, preference learning, and alignment of large language models. The first contribution addresses constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under the average-cost criterion through the Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm. ACPO integrates sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates to ensure stable constraint handling, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees. Constrained RL is then extended to finite-horizon settings via e-COP, the first policy optimization method for episodic CMDPs. Built on an episodic policy difference lemma, e-COP offers provable performance, simplicity, and scalability in safety-critical environments. The thesis then investigates reinforcement learning from human preferences. warmPref-PS introduces a posterior sampling strategy for linear bandits that integrates offline preference data from heterogeneous raters into online learning. Explicit modeling of rater competence yields substantial regret reduction and more efficient data collection for RLHF. The PSPL algorithm further advances preference-based RL by jointly sampling reward models and transition dynamics from pairwise trajectory comparisons, providing Bayesian simple-regret guarantees and robust empirical identification of optimal policies. The final contribution applies these methods to large-scale model alignment. A multi-objective constrained optimization view yields MOPO, an iterative algorithm with closed-form updates that scales to multi-billion-parameter language models and remains robust across alignment settings. Collectively, the thesis unifies constrained RL across average-cost, episodic, and preference-driven paradigms, delivering theoretical advances and practical tools for safe and aligned decision-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BNNs offer principled uncertainty quantification but have high computational and memory overhead; applying quantization to reduce resource requirements in probabilistic models is largely unexplored.

Method: Proposes a multi-level quantization framework with three strategies—VPQ, SPQ, and JQ—using logarithmic quantization for variance parameters and specialized activation functions to preserve distributional structure.

Result: On Dirty-MNIST, BNNs quantized to 4 bits retain classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement, with Joint Quantization achieving up to 8× memory reduction over floating-point implementations.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that 4-bit quantized BNNs can maintain both accuracy and uncertainty calibration, making deployment on resource-constrained devices feasible while providing design guidelines for future analog 'Bayesian Machines'.

Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide principled uncertainty quantification but suffer from substantial computational and memory overhead compared to deterministic networks. While quantization techniques have successfully reduced resource requirements in standard deep learning models, their application to probabilistic models remains largely unexplored. We introduce a systematic multi-level quantization framework for Stochastic Variational Inference based BNNs that distinguishes between three quantization strategies: Variational Parameter Quantization (VPQ), Sampled Parameter Quantization (SPQ), and Joint Quantization (JQ). Our logarithmic quantization for variance parameters, and specialized activation functions to preserve the distributional structure are essential for calibrated uncertainty estimation. Through comprehensive experiments on Dirty-MNIST, we demonstrate that BNNs can be quantized down to 4-bit precision while maintaining both classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement. At 4 bits, Joint Quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction compared to floating-point implementations with minimal degradation in epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These results enable deployment of BNNs on resource-constrained edge devices and provide design guidelines for future analog "Bayesian Machines" operating at inherently low precision.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates attention convergence in large language models as context windows grow, introducing token-sample complexity to measure how attention approaches its infinite-token limit. It provides convergence bounds at different levels and validates findings with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With expanding context windows in LLMs, understanding attention behavior at extreme sequence lengths is crucial for model performance and scalability.

Method: The authors analyze convergence rates for attention maps and transformed token distributions, considering compactly supported and sub-Gaussian distributions. They also examine the hardmax limit.

Result: Pointwise uniform convergence of attention maps occurs at rate C(R)/√n, while transformed token distribution moments converge at rate C'(R)/n^β with β<1/2. Experimental validation on synthetic and real data supports theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical foundations for attention convergence in long sequences, highlighting practical limitations of uniform convergence and offering alternative moment-based convergence rates with better scaling properties.

Abstract: As context windows in large language models continue to expand, it is essential to characterize how attention behaves at extreme sequence lengths. We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^β$ with $β<\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $β$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution. We also examine the regime in which the attention parameter tends to infinity and the softmax approaches a hardmax, and in this setting, we establish a logarithmic rate of convergence. Experiments on synthetic Gaussian data and real BERT models on Wikipedia text confirm our predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed DCFO method for counterfactual explanations in LOF outlier detection, outperforming competitors with better proximity and validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for interpretable outlier detection, particularly for widely used methods like LOF, where existing counterfactual explanation methods fail to address unique outlier detection challenges and algorithm-specific requirements.

Method: The authors propose DCFO, which partitions the data space into regions where LOF behaves smoothly to enable gradient-based optimization for generating counterfactual explanations.

Result: Experimental validation on 50 OpenML datasets shows DCFO consistently outperforms benchmark competitors, providing superior proximity and validity of generated counterfactuals.

Conclusion: DCFO successfully addresses the interpretability gap in LOF by introducing an efficient density-based counterfactual explanation method that partitions data space for gradient optimization, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Outlier detection identifies data points that significantly deviate from the majority of the data distribution. Explaining outliers is crucial for understanding the underlying factors that contribute to their detection, validating their significance, and identifying potential biases or errors. Effective explanations provide actionable insights, facilitating preventive measures to avoid similar outliers in the future. Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is one the most popular unsupervised outlier detection methods, quantifying outlierness through relative local density. Despite LOF's widespread use across diverse applications, it lacks interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Density-based Counterfactuals for Outliers (DCFO), a novel method specifically designed to generate counterfactual explanations for LOF. DCFO partitions the data space into regions where LOF behaves smoothly, enabling efficient gradient-based optimisation. Extensive experimental validation on 50 OpenML datasets demonstrates that DCFO consistently outperforms benchmarked competitors, offering superior proximity and validity of generated counterfactuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite compositional generalization being crucial for AI models, the underlying data structures enabling this capability remain poorly understood.

Method: Formalizes compositional generalization using causal modularity principles and introduces a hierarchical data-generating process that encodes different concept levels and their interaction mechanisms.

Result: The approach enables compositional generalization supporting complex relations between concepts and proves the latent hierarchical structure is identifiable from observable data like text-image pairs.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework achieves significant improvements on benchmark datasets, advancing beyond prior work that assumed simpler interactions between composed concepts.

Abstract: Compositional generalization -- the ability to understand and generate novel combinations of learned concepts -- enables models to extend their capabilities beyond limited experiences. While effective, the data structures and principles that enable this crucial capability remain poorly understood. We propose that compositional generalization fundamentally requires decomposing high-level concepts into basic, low-level concepts that can be recombined across similar contexts, similar to how humans draw analogies between concepts. For example, someone who has never seen a peacock eating rice can envision this scene by relating it to their previous observations of a chicken eating rice.
  In this work, we formalize these intuitive processes using principles of causal modularity and minimal changes. We introduce a hierarchical data-generating process that naturally encodes different levels of concepts and their interaction mechanisms. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this approach enables compositional generalization supporting complex relations between composed concepts, advancing beyond prior work that assumes simpler interactions like additive effects. Critically, we also prove that this latent hierarchical structure is provably recoverable (identifiable) from observable data like text-image pairs, a necessary step for learning such a generative process. To validate our theory, we apply insights from our theoretical framework and achieve significant improvements on benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep generative models are opaque black boxes lacking theoretical guarantees for interpretability, hindering human understanding and control.

Method: Proposes hierarchical selection models with causal minimality constraints (sparsity/compression) to learn representations equivalent to true latent variables in diffusion vision and autoregressive language models.

Result: Applied to leading generative models, the framework successfully extracts innate hierarchical concept graphs and enables component-wise identifiable control.

Conclusion: Causal minimality provides a principled foundation for interpretable generative models, paving the way for transparent and reliable AI systems.

Abstract: Deep generative models, while revolutionizing fields like image and text generation, largely operate as opaque black boxes, hindering human understanding, control, and alignment. While methods like sparse autoencoders (SAEs) show remarkable empirical success, they often lack theoretical guarantees, risking subjective insights. Our primary objective is to establish a principled foundation for interpretable generative models. We demonstrate that the principle of causal minimality -- favoring the simplest causal explanation -- can endow the latent representations of diffusion vision and autoregressive language models with clear causal interpretation and robust, component-wise identifiable control. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models, where higher-level concepts emerge from the constrained composition of lower-level variables, better capturing the complex dependencies in data generation. Under theoretically derived minimality conditions (manifesting as sparsity or compression constraints), we show that learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process. Empirically, applying these constraints to leading generative models allows us to extract their innate hierarchical concept graphs, offering fresh insights into their internal knowledge organization. Furthermore, these causally grounded concepts serve as levers for fine-grained model steering, paving the way for transparent, reliable systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending neural operators to spherical domains is challenging due to geometric distortions and lack of flexibility in existing rotational-equivariant methods.

Method: Design framework based on spherical Green's function with absolute/relative position dependency, GSNO operator with spectral learning, and GSHNet hierarchical architecture.

Result: GSNO and GSHNet outperform state-of-the-art methods on diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: GSNO provides a principled framework bridging theory and real-world complexity for spherical operator learning.

Abstract: Neural operators offer powerful approaches for solving parametric partial differential equations, but extending them to spherical domains remains challenging due to the need to preserve intrinsic geometry while avoiding distortions that break rotational consistency. Existing spherical operators rely on rotational equivariance but often lack the flexibility for real-world complexity. We propose a general operator-design framework based on the designable spherical Green's function and its harmonic expansion, establishing a solid operator-theoretic foundation for spherical learning. Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency. To exploit GSNO, we develop GSHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation. Evaluations on diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting, GSNO and GSHNet consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our results position GSNO as a principled and general framework for spherical operator learning, bridging rigorous theory with real-world complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of message-passing GNNs (limited by 1-WL test) and k-WL-based GNNs (high computational cost, poor interpretability due to loss of node/edge semantics).

Method: Constructs a line graph from induced subgraphs around each node for higher-order aggregation.

Result: LGAN has greater expressive power than 2-WL with lower complexity, and outperforms state-of-the-art k-WL-based GNNs on benchmarks.

Conclusion: LGAN provides an effective balance of expressiveness, efficiency, and interpretability for graph classification.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for graph classification. Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity. Empirical evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the LGAN outperforms state-of-the-art k-WL-based GNNs, while offering better interpretability.

*Hang Ni,Weijia Zhang,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that integrates spectral analysis and event priors to improve prediction of diversified extreme events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for weather forecasting have limited ability to predict extreme weather events, as they either focus on general weather or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events.

Method: Proposes UniExtreme with two key modules: (1) Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) using learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation to capture spectral disparities, and (2) Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) using a dual-level memory fusion network to incorporate region-specific extreme event priors and handle hierarchical diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extreme and general weather forecasting, demonstrating superior adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

Conclusion: UniExtreme successfully demonstrates that modeling spectral disparities and hierarchical event structures can significantly improve extreme weather forecasting performance while maintaining or enhancing general weather prediction capabilities. The dual-module approach represents a promising direction for foundation models in weather forecasting.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation, and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrosynthesis models lack accuracy and robustness for practical use, requiring template-free approaches.

Method: Transformer framework injecting molecular graph information into attention mechanism with paired data augmentation.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on USPTO-50K benchmark, significantly outperforming baseline Transformer.

Conclusion: The proposed template-free method effectively combines structural and sequential data for improved retrosynthesis prediction.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis reaction prediction seeks to infer plausible reactant molecules for a given product and is a central problem in computer-aided organic synthesis. Despite recent progress, many existing models still fall short of the accuracy and robustness required for practical deployment. This work studies a template-free, Transformer-based framework that eliminates reliance on handcrafted reaction templates or additional chemical rule engines. The model injects molecular graph information into the attention mechanism to jointly exploit \SMILES\ sequences and structural cues, and further applies a paired data augmentation strategy to enhance training diversity and scale. On the USPTO-50K benchmark, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among template-free methods and substantially outperforming a vanilla Transformer baseline.

TL;DR: CB-SAE improves sparse autoencoder interpretability (+32.1%) and steerability (+14.5%) in LVLMs by pruning ineffective neurons and adding concept bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAEs have limitations: most neurons lack interpretability/steerability, and desired concepts are often missing due to unsupervised learning.

Method: Proposed CB-SAE framework with two new metrics to evaluate neurons, prune low-utility ones, and augment latent space with user-aligned concept bottlenecks.

Result: Significant improvements in interpretability and steerability across LVLMs and image generation tasks.

Conclusion: CB-SAE addresses key SAE limitations, enhancing practical utility for mechanistic interpretability and model steering.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) promise a unified approach for mechanistic interpretability, concept discovery, and model steering in LLMs and LVLMs. However, realizing this potential requires that the learned features be both interpretable and steerable. To that end, we introduce two new computationally inexpensive interpretability and steerability metrics and conduct a systematic analysis on LVLMs. Our analysis uncovers two observations; (i) a majority of SAE neurons exhibit either low interpretability or low steerability or both, rendering them ineffective for downstream use; and (ii) due to the unsupervised nature of SAEs, user-desired concepts are often absent in the learned dictionary, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set. The resulting CB-SAE improves interpretability by +32.1% and steerability by +14.5% across LVLMs and image generation tasks. We will make our code and model weights available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL framework for controllable player behaviors without human data using continuous behavior space sampling and PPO-based training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing approaches that require player trajectories, train separate models, or lack interpretable parameter mapping.

Method: Define N-dim behavior space, sample target vectors, train agents with current/target vectors as input using distance-based rewards via PPO.

Result: Achieves greater behavioral diversity than baseline, reliably matches specified behaviors without retraining.

Conclusion: Scalable solution for playtesting, game balancing, and human-like AI in games.

Abstract: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that enables controllable and diverse player behaviors without relying on human gameplay data. Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets. The method offers a scalable solution for automated playtesting, game balancing, human-like behavior simulation, and replacing disconnected players in online games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression's sensitivity to noise limits its practical use; this work seeks to enhance robustness and enable uncertainty quantification in noisy environments.

Method: Uses an SMC framework with probabilistic selection, adaptive tempering, and normalized marginal likelihood to explore the symbolic expression space efficiently.

Result: The method outperforms standard genetic programming baselines on noisy datasets, producing parsimonious expressions with better generalization and less overfitting.

Conclusion: The approach enables more robust symbolic regression, advancing applications in scientific discovery and engineering design by yielding accurate, interpretable equations under noise.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a powerful tool for discovering governing equations directly from data, but its sensitivity to noise hinders its broader application. This paper introduces a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework for Bayesian symbolic regression that approximates the posterior distribution over symbolic expressions, enhancing robustness and enabling uncertainty quantification for symbolic regression in the presence of noise. Differing from traditional genetic programming approaches, the SMC-based algorithm combines probabilistic selection, adaptive tempering, and the use of normalized marginal likelihood to efficiently explore the search space of symbolic expressions, yielding parsimonious expressions with improved generalization. When compared to standard genetic programming baselines, the proposed method better deals with challenging, noisy benchmark datasets. The reduced tendency to overfit and enhanced ability to discover accurate and interpretable equations paves the way for more robust symbolic regression in scientific discovery and engineering design applications.

*Chirag Modi,Jiequn Han,Eric Vanden-Eijnden,Joan Bruna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCSI is a novel transport-based generative modeling method that can learn to invert corruption channels from noisy data alone, enabling clean data generation without requiring clean training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scientific and engineering data often contains corruption from noisy measurement channels, making direct generative modeling challenging since clean data is unavailable.

Method: Uses stochastic interpolants to iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data, requiring only access to corrupted dataset and black-box knowledge of corruption channel.

Result: Method is computationally efficient, flexible for nonlinear forward models, and shows superior performance on natural image and scientific reconstruction inverse problems.

Conclusion: SCSI provides an effective framework for solving inverse problems at the distribution level, with theoretical convergence guarantees and practical advantages over variational alternatives.

Abstract: Transport-based methods have emerged as a leading paradigm for building generative models from large, clean datasets. However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate superior performance on inverse problems in natural image processing and scientific reconstruction, and establish convergence guarantees of the scheme under appropriate assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) scaling behavior compared to autoregressive models (ALMs), focusing on noise types and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLMs are proposed as alternatives to ALMs but their scaling behavior is not fully understood, with prior work suggesting they require more resources to match ALM performance.

Method: Study DLM scaling by interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion, adjusting hyperparameters like batch size and learning rate.

Result: DLM scaling depends on noise type; uniform diffusion is more parameter-efficient but less data-hungry than masked diffusion, making it suitable for data-limited settings.

Conclusion: Uniform diffusion scaled to 10B parameters confirms predicted behavior, positioning it as a viable large-scale alternative to ALMs in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Modern LLM pre-training consumes vast amounts of compute and training data, making the scaling behavior, or scaling laws, of different models a key distinguishing factor. Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs.
  We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date.

Abstract: We study long-horizon exogenous-only temperature forecasting - a challenging univariate setting where only the past values of the indoor temperature are used for prediction - using linear and Transformer-family models. We evaluate Linear, NLinear, DLinear, Transformer, Informer, and Autoformer under standardized train, validation, and test splits. Results show that linear baselines (Linear, NLinear, DLinear) consistently outperform more complex Transformer-family architectures, with DLinear achieving the best overall accuracy across all splits. These findings highlight that carefully designed linear models remain strong baselines for time series forecasting in challenging exogenous-only settings.

TL;DR: GTL enables transfer learning for discrete diffusion models without fine-tuning, using guidance to adapt pretrained models to new domains with an efficient sampler for large vocabulary/long sequence scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models require large datasets for new domains, making transfer learning important but current fine-tuning methods are computationally expensive and impractical.

Method: Proposes Guided Transfer Learning (GTL) using ratio-based guidance to sample from target distributions without modifying pretrained denoisers, with an efficient sampler focusing on planner-selected positions and top tokens.

Result: Provides unified treatment for discrete-time and continuous-time diffusion, enables practical guided language modeling at scale through efficient sampling.

Conclusion: GTL offers effective transfer learning for discrete diffusion models with computational efficiency, validated on synthetic and language modeling tasks.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models achieve strong performance across language and other discrete domains, providing a powerful alternative to autoregressive models. However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior.

TL;DR: Counterfactuals improve model reconstruction by serving as informative boundary samples. Proposed method integrates counterfactuals with original data using Wasserstein barycenter to better approximate class prototypes, enhancing surrogate model fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactuals are typically near decision boundaries and can provide valuable information for model reconstruction, especially when labeled data is limited. However, naive use of counterfactuals as training instances can cause decision boundary shift.

Method: Integrate original data samples with counterfactuals and approximate class prototypes using Wasserstein barycenter to preserve distributional structure of each class.

Result: Empirical results across multiple datasets show improved fidelity between surrogate and target models compared to naive approaches.

Conclusion: Strategic integration of counterfactuals with original data using distribution-aware methods enhances surrogate model quality and mitigates boundary shift issues in model reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide actionable insights by identifying minimal input changes required to achieve a desired model prediction. Beyond their interpretability benefits, counterfactuals can also be leveraged for model reconstruction, where a surrogate model is trained to replicate the behavior of a target model. In this work, we demonstrate that model reconstruction can be significantly improved by recognizing that counterfactuals, which typically lie close to the decision boundary, can serve as informative though less representative samples for both classes. This is particularly beneficial in settings with limited access to labeled data. We propose a method that integrates original data samples with counterfactuals to approximate class prototypes using the Wasserstein barycenter, thereby preserving the underlying distributional structure of each class. This approach enhances the quality of the surrogate model and mitigates the issue of decision boundary shift, which commonly arises when counterfactuals are naively treated as ordinary training instances. Empirical results across multiple datasets show that our method improves fidelity between the surrogate and target models, validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: Physics-informed machine learning framework infers latent hydraulic imbalances and receiver degradation in CSP plants from operational data


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parabolic trough CSP plants have unobserved loop-level mass flows and receiver heat-loss parameters, making it impossible to diagnose hydraulic imbalances or receiver degradation using standard monitoring tools

Method: Physics-informed learning framework using differentiable conjugate heat-transfer model embedded in end-to-end learning pipeline, exploiting nocturnal homogenization periods when hot oil circulates through non-irradiated field

Result: Model accurately reconstructs loop temperatures (RMSE <2°C), produces physically meaningful estimates of loop imbalances and receiver heat losses, and shows strong correspondence with drone-based infrared thermography (QScan)

Conclusion: Noisy real-world CSP operational data contain enough information to recover latent physical parameters when combined with appropriate modeling and differentiable optimization

Abstract: Parabolic trough Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants operate large hydraulic networks of collector loops that must deliver a uniform outlet temperature despite spatially heterogeneous optical performance, heat losses, and pressure drops. While loop temperatures are measured, loop-level mass flows and receiver heat-loss parameters are unobserved, making it impossible to diagnose hydraulic imbalances or receiver degradation using standard monitoring tools.
  We present a physics-informed learning framework that infers (i) loop-level mass-flow ratios and (ii) time-varying receiver heat-transfer coefficients directly from routine operational data. The method exploits nocturnal homogenization periods -- when hot oil is circulated through a non-irradiated field -- to isolate hydraulic and thermal-loss effects. A differentiable conjugate heat-transfer model is discretized and embedded into an end-to-end learning pipeline optimized using historical plant data from the 50 MW Andasol 3 solar field.
  The model accurately reconstructs loop temperatures (RMSE $<2^\circ$C) and produces physically meaningful estimates of loop imbalances and receiver heat losses. Comparison against drone-based infrared thermography (QScan) shows strong correspondence, correctly identifying all areas with high-loss receivers. This demonstrates that noisy real-world CSP operational data contain enough information to recover latent physical parameters when combined with appropriate modeling and differentiable optimization.

TL;DR: A 1-swap pruning algorithm for LLMs that decouples rows with equal sparsity, efficiently computes optimal swaps using Gram matrices, and improves performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pruning methods are computationally prohibitive for LLMs, and existing approximations are suboptimal; there's a need for tractable, hyperparameter-free pruning at scale.

Method: Decouple rows by enforcing equal sparsity per row, derive optimal 1-swaps efficiently via Gram matrix of calibration data, and propose a GPU-friendly algorithm warm-starting from any mask.

Result: Reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda, consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across GPT architectures.

Conclusion: The 1-swap algorithm offers a scalable, efficient solution for LLM pruning with significant performance gains and minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: The resource requirements of Neural Networks can be significantly reduced through pruning -- the removal of seemingly less important parameters. However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. We demonstrate that our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of autonomous underwater navigation including GPS absence, poor visibility, and submerged obstacles using the BlueROV2 platform.

Method: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with observation space combining target-oriented navigation, virtual occupancy grid, and boundary ray-casting; compared against Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) baseline.

Result: PPO policy consistently outperforms DWA in cluttered environments with better local adaptation and fewer collisions.

Conclusion: Deep reinforcement learning is relevant for autonomous underwater navigation, demonstrated by successful transfer from simulation to physical BlueROV2 using 3D digital twin supervision.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in underwater environments remains a major challenge due to the absence of GPS, degraded visibility, and the presence of submerged obstacles. This article investigates these issues through the case of the BlueROV2, an open platform widely used for scientific experimentation. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, using an observation space that combines target-oriented navigation information, a virtual occupancy grid, and ray-casting along the boundaries of the operational area. The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation. The results show that the PPO policy consistently outperforms DWA in highly cluttered environments, notably thanks to better local adaptation and reduced collisions. Finally, the experiments demonstrate the transferability of the learned behavior from simulation to the real world, confirming the relevance of deep RL for autonomous navigation in underwater robotics.

*Qiyang Li,Seohong Park,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new algorithm decouples critic and policy chunk lengths via a distilled critic with optimistic backup, enabling efficient multi-step value propagation while maintaining policy reactivity in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While chunked critics accelerate value estimation by processing action sequences, extracting reactive policies from them is problematic. Policies must output entire action chunks open-loop, leading to sub-optimality in reactive environments and modeling challenges with long chunks.

Method: The proposed algorithm decouples critic and policy chunk lengths. It optimizes the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one.

Result: The method reliably outperforms prior methods on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that decoupling critic and policy chunk lengths via a distilled critic with optimistic backup enables efficient long-horizon value estimation while maintaining policy reactivity, leading to superior performance in challenging offline goal-conditioned tasks.

Abstract: Temporal-difference (TD) methods learn state and action values efficiently by bootstrapping from their own future value predictions, but such a self-bootstrapping mechanism is prone to bootstrapping bias, where the errors in the value targets accumulate across steps and result in biased value estimates. Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences ("chunks") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks. We evaluate our method on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks and show that it reliably outperforms prior methods. Code: github.com/ColinQiyangLi/dqc.

*George Yakushev,Nataliia Babina,Masoud Vahid Dastgerdi,Vyacheslav Zhdanovskiy,Alina Shutova,Denis Kuznedelev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Async Reasoning: Enables LLMs to think and respond in real-time by using rotary embeddings to allow simultaneous input processing, reasoning, and output generation, cutting initial response delay from minutes to ≤5s.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are designed for sequential interactions: they must complete their entire internal 'thinking' process before generating an output token. This creates a latency barrier for real-time applications like voice assistants or embedded systems that require low-latency, interactive, and asynchronous responses, similar to human capabilities of listening and thinking concurrently.

Method: The authors propose a method that uses the inherent properties of rotary embeddings within the transformer architecture. This method decouples the processing of input (listening), internal computation (thinking), and output token generation, allowing them to happen concurrently instead of sequentially. It builds upon the 'thinking spaces' concept but eliminates the need for a separate latent space by directly manipulating the attention mechanisms of the transformer to enable overlapping execution.

Result: The method significantly reduces latency. The time to the first non-thinking token drops from minutes to ≤5 seconds. Overall real-time delays are reduced by 6-11 times across evaluations on math (GSM8K), commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), and safety reasoning tasks. The model maintains reasoning accuracy while achieving these substantial speedups in interactive settings.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that rotary embeddings can be leveraged to enable reasoning LLMs to operate asynchronously—thinking, listening, and generating outputs simultaneously—without additional training, thereby making them suitable for real-time interactive applications.

Abstract: Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for fast and efficient approaches to estimate adversarial robustness of neural networks.

Method: Utilizes projection-free modified Frank-Wolfe methods for adversarial attack optimization.

Result: Theoretical and numerical evaluation performed on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using logistic regression, CNNs, and Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of projection-free methods compared to standard projection-based approaches for adversarial attack construction.

Abstract: The construction of adversarial attacks for neural networks appears to be a crucial challenge for their deployment in various services. To estimate the adversarial robustness of a neural network, a fast and efficient approach is needed to construct adversarial attacks. Since the formalization of adversarial attack construction involves solving a specific optimization problem, we consider the problem of constructing an efficient and effective adversarial attack from a numerical optimization perspective. Specifically, we suggest utilizing advanced projection-free methods, known as modified Frank-Wolfe methods, to construct white-box adversarial attacks on the given input data. We perform a theoretical and numerical evaluation of these methods and compare them with standard approaches based on projection operations or geometrical intuition. Numerical experiments are performed on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, utilizing a multiclass logistic regression model, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the Vision Transformer (ViT).

*Mingzhi Chen,Taiming Lu,Jiachen Zhu,Mingjie Sun,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Derf, a new point-wise activation function using the scaled Gaussian CDF, outperforms normalization layers and previous alternatives like DyT across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find a function design that surpasses Dynamic Tanh (DyT) for normalization-free architectures by studying intrinsic properties of point-wise functions.

Method: Conducted a large-scale search for effective function designs based on intrinsic properties, resulting in Derf(x) = erf(αx + s).

Result: Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT in vision, speech representation, and DNA modeling tasks.

Conclusion: Derf's gains come from improved generalization, making it a practical normalization-free alternative for Transformers.

Abstract: Although normalization layers have long been viewed as indispensable components of deep learning architectures, the recent introduction of Dynamic Tanh (DyT) has demonstrated that alternatives are possible. The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches normalization-level performance; this work seeks further for function designs that can surpass it. We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \mathrm{erf}(αx + s)$, where $\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures.

*Xiaona Zhou,Yingyan Zeng,Ran Jin,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper introduces DaSH method for selecting entire datasets from heterogeneous pools to improve downstream ML performance under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring dataset-level differences and source variations.

Method: DaSH (Dataset Selection via Hierarchies) models utility at both dataset and group levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 26.2% accuracy on Digit-Five and DomainNet benchmarks, with fewer exploration steps.

Conclusion: DaSH is robust in low-resource settings and suitable for scalable multi-source learning workflows.

Abstract: The success of modern machine learning hinges on access to high-quality training data. In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorporate into model training are therefore critical decisions, yet most existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources. In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps. Ablations show DaSH is robust to low-resource settings and lack of relevant datasets, making it suitable for scalable and adaptive dataset selection in practical multi-source learning workflows.

*Yiyang Lu,Qiao Sun,Xianbang Wang,Zhicheng Jiang,Hanhong Zhao,Kaiming He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiFlow removes the need for exact analytic inverses in normalizing flows, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures while accelerating sampling and improving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent developments have exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck in normalizing flows, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: Introduces BiFlow, which learns a reverse model to approximate the noise-to-data inverse mapping instead of requiring exact analytic invertibility.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet show BiFlow improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude compared to causal decoding methods.

Conclusion: BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation methods, encouraging further attention to the normalizing flows paradigm.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) have been established as a principled framework for generative modeling. Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation ("1-NFE") methods. Following recent encouraging progress on NFs, we hope our work will draw further attention to this classical paradigm.

### [128] [Norm-Governed Multi-Agent Decision-Making in Simulator-Coupled Environments:The Reinsurance Constrained Multi-Agent Simulation Process (R-CMASP)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09939)
*Stella C. Dong*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-CMASP, a multi-agent model for reinsurance that incorporates simulation, role specialization, and normative constraints to improve decision-making stability and compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinsurance involves complex interactions with distributed information and regulatory constraints that existing deterministic automation cannot handle effectively.

Method: Extends stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs by adding simulator-coupled dynamics, role-specialized agents with structured communication, and a normative feasibility layer.

Result: LLM-based agents in a synthetic environment showed more stable, coherent, and norm-adherent behavior, reducing pricing variance and improving efficiency.

Conclusion: Norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems are the most suitable model for regulated decision environments like reinsurance.

Abstract: Reinsurance decision-making exhibits the core structural properties that motivate multi-agent models: distributed and asymmetric information, partial observability, heterogeneous epistemic responsibilities, simulator-driven environment dynamics, and binding prudential and regulatory constraints. Deterministic workflow automation cannot meet these requirements, as it lacks the epistemic flexibility, cooperative coordination mechanisms, and norm-sensitive behaviour required for institutional risk-transfer.
  We propose the Reinsurance Constrained Multi-Agent Simulation Process (R-CMASP), a formal model that extends stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs by adding three missing elements: (i) simulator-coupled transition dynamics grounded in catastrophe, capital, and portfolio engines; (ii) role-specialized agents with structured observability, belief updates, and typed communication; and (iii) a normative feasibility layer encoding solvency, regulatory, and organizational rules as admissibility constraints on joint actions.
  Using LLM-based agents with tool access and typed message protocols, we show in a domain-calibrated synthetic environment that governed multi-agent coordination yields more stable, coherent, and norm-adherent behaviour than deterministic automation or monolithic LLM baselines--reducing pricing variance, improving capital efficiency, and increasing clause-interpretation accuracy. Embedding prudential norms as admissibility constraints and structuring communication into typed acts measurably enhances equilibrium stability.
  Overall, the results suggest that regulated, simulator-driven decision environments are most naturally modelled as norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems.

*Jingyao Ren,Eric Ewing,T. K. Satish Kumar,Sven Koenig,Nora Ayanian*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper identifies three key research challenges in understanding why some multi-agent pathfinding instances are harder than others despite NP-hard complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between MAPF's theoretical complexity and the observed variation in empirical hardness across instances.

Method: Outlines three research challenges: algorithm selection, identifying key instance features affecting hardness, and generating hard instances/benchmarks.

Result: Establishes foundation for MAPF empirical hardness research and identifies underexplored areas.

Conclusion: Encourages deeper investigation into MAPF empirical hardness through three outlined research challenges.

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding collision-free paths for a team of agents on a map. Although MAPF is NP-hard, the hardness of solving individual instances varies significantly, revealing a gap between theoretical complexity and actual hardness. This paper outlines three key research challenges in MAPF empirical hardness to understand such phenomena. The first challenge, known as algorithm selection, is determining the best-performing algorithms for a given instance. The second challenge is understanding the key instance features that affect MAPF empirical hardness, such as structural properties like phase transition and backbone/backdoor. The third challenge is how to leverage our knowledge of MAPF empirical hardness to effectively generate hard MAPF instances or diverse benchmark datasets. This work establishes a foundation for future empirical hardness research and encourages deeper investigation into these promising and underexplored areas.

### [130] [Emergent Collective Memory in Decentralized Multi-Agent AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10166)
*Khushiyant*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Decentralized multi-agent systems achieve collective memory through interplay of individual memory and environmental traces, surpassing no-memory baselines by 68.7%, with environmental traces requiring cognitive infrastructure and showing dominance above certain agent densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how collective memory emerges in decentralized multi-agent systems without centralized control through the combination of individual agent memory and environmental trace communication.

Method: Used agents with internal memory states depositing persistent environmental traces in grid environments (20x20 to 50x50) with varying agent numbers (5-625), conducting 50 runs per configuration and systematic density-sweep experiments.

Result: Individual memory alone provided 68.7% performance improvement over no-memory baselines; environmental traces without memory failed completely; stigmergic coordination dominated above density ~0.20 with traces outperforming memory by 36-41% on composite metrics; verified theoretical phase transition prediction with critical density rho_c = 0.230 within 13% error.

Conclusion: Memory functions independently but environmental traces require cognitive infrastructure for interpretation, with system showing predictable phase transitions where stigmergic coordination becomes dominant at higher agent densities.

Abstract: We demonstrate how collective memory emerges in decentralized multi-agent systems through the interplay between individual agent memory and environmental trace communication. Our agents maintain internal memory states while depositing persistent environmental traces, creating a spatially distributed collective memory without centralized control. Comprehensive validation across five environmental conditions (20x20 to 50x50 grids, 5-20 agents, 50 runs per configuration) reveals a critical asymmetry: individual memory alone provides 68.7% performance improvement over no-memory baselines (1563.87 vs 927.23, p < 0.001), while environmental traces without memory fail completely. This demonstrates that memory functions independently but traces require cognitive infrastructure for interpretation. Systematic density-sweep experiments (rho in [0.049, 0.300], up to 625 agents) validate our theoretical phase transition prediction. On realistic large grids (30x30, 50x50), stigmergic coordination dominates above rho ~ 0.20, with traces outperforming memory by 36-41% on composite metrics despite lower food efficiency. The experimental crossover confirms the predicted critical density rho_c = 0.230 within 13% error.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: TWD is a concurrent routing framework integrating LLMs into traffic simulation, enabling real-time route planning while agents move to reduce wait times, with 0.75s average decision latency under high traffic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches require agents to stop for deliberation, causing delays. The goal is to enable LLM-based planning during movement to improve traffic flow.

Method: Non-blocking asynchronous architecture using Unity coroutines and request manager. Environment is a weighted undirected graph with live congestion metrics updated continuously by agents.

Result: LLM-driven agents dynamically adapt to traffic, reroute around congestion, and exhibit behaviors beyond static pathfinding while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reproducible basis for future research in adaptive routing and multi-agent cooperation.

Abstract: We present Thinking While Driving, a concurrent routing framework that integrates LLMs into a graph-based traffic environment. Unlike approaches that require agents to stop and deliberate, our system enables LLM-based route planning while agents are moving, significantly reducing intersection wait times. Under high traffic, agents average just 0.75 seconds of decision latency. To coordinate many agents in real-time, we implement a non-blocking asynchronous architecture using Unity coroutines and a dedicated request manager. The environment is a weighted undirected graph with live congestion metrics, updated continuously by the agents to enable shared perception. Our results show LLM-driven agents can dynamically adapt to traffic, reroute around congestion, and exhibit behaviors beyond static pathfinding, all while maintaining real-time performance. This work provides a reproducible framework for future research in adaptive routing and multi-agent cooperation.
