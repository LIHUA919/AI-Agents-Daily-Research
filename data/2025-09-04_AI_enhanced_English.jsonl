Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic\nand games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in\nLLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL\nsetting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy\nregularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the\nsparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy\ncontrol method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically\nadjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized\npolicy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration\nwithin a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically\nadjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively\ncontrolling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.\nAEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and\ndatasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently\nacross multiple benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "AEnt is a new entropy control method for LLM-RL that addresses issues with conventional entropy regularization in large language models by using clamped entropy bonus with automatic coefficient adjustment.", "motivation": "Conventional entropy regularization works well in traditional RL but fails in LLM-RL due to extremely large response space and sparse optimal outputs, requiring a specialized approach.", "method": "Proposes AEnt with clamped entropy bonus using re-normalized policy on smaller token space, plus automatic coefficient adjustment to control entropy-induced bias while maintaining exploration benefits.", "result": "AEnt consistently outperforms baselines across multiple math-reasoning tasks with different base models and datasets.", "conclusion": "The proposed AEnt method effectively addresses entropy control challenges in LLM-RL settings and demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional approaches."}}
