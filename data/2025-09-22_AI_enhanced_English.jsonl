To accelerate\nmodel inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive\ndeep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT\nin AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud,\nvehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from\n-40{\\deg}C to 50{\\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally,\nheats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase.\nThese temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments\nthrough mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks\nare designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency\nvariations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer\ncritical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors,\nhigh/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series\noperators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot\nbe detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they\nignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning\nframework testing method under temperature-varying environments.

By stacking all\nsimilarity matrices into a tensor, we further recover the incomplete structure\nfrom the high-order consistency information based on the low-rank tensor\nlearning. Additionally, the anchor-based strategy is incorporated to reduce the\ncomputational complexity. An efficient alternative optimization algorithm\ncombining a reduced gradient descent method is developed to solve the\nformulated objective, with theoretical convergence.

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and\nits variants are widely used to train deep neural networks. In contrast to\ntraditional approaches that focus on tuning the learning rate, we propose a\nnovel adaptive batch size SGD algorithm, DiveBatch, that dynamically adjusts\nthe batch size. Adapting the batch size is challenging: using large batch sizes\nis more efficient due to parallel computation, but small-batch training often\nconverges in fewer epochs and generalizes better. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a data-driven adaptation based on gradient diversity, enabling\nDiveBatch to maintain the generalization performance of small-batch training\nwhile improving convergence speed and computational efficiency. Gradient\ndiversity has a strong theoretical justification: it emerges from the\nconvergence analysis of SGD. Evaluations of DiveBatch on synthetic and\nCiFar-10, CiFar-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that DiveBatch converges\nsignificantly faster than standard SGD and AdaBatch (1.06 -- 5.0x), with a\nslight trade-off in performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiveBatch is a novel adaptive batch size SGD algorithm that dynamically adjusts batch size using gradient diversity to accelerate training while maintaining generalization performance.", "motivation": "Training large-scale deep neural networks is computationally expensive, and while SGD variants are widely used, traditional approaches focus on learning rate tuning.
