### [1] [Situation Model of the Transport, Transport Emissions and Meteorological Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10541)
*V. Benes,M. Svitek,A. Michalikova,M. Melicherik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fuzzy inference system model predicts traffic emissions based on weather conditions using Prague data to help urban planning and environmental protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution in cities is a critical societal issue, requiring systemic approaches to understand traffic emissions and their relationship with meteorological conditions for effective urban transport management.

Method: Developed a fuzzy inference system (FIS) model using traffic, meteorology, and emission data measured in Prague to predict changes in emissions under various conditions.

Result: Created a predictive model that analyzes how weather conditions affect the quantity and dispersion of traffic emissions in urban environments.

Conclusion: The model provides valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers to manage urban transport more effectively while considering environmental protection goals.

Abstract: Air pollution in cities and the possibilities of reducing this pollution
represents one of the most important factors that today's society has to deal
with. This paper focuses on a systemic approach to traffic emissions with their
relation to meteorological conditions, analyzing the effect of weather on the
quantity and dispersion of traffic emissions in a city. Using fuzzy inference
systems (FIS) the model for prediction of changes in emissions depending on
various conditions is developed. The proposed model is based on traffic,
meteorology and emission data measured in Prague, Czech Republic. The main
objective of the work is to provide insight into how urban planners and
policymakers can plan and manage urban transport more effectively with
environmental protection in mind.

### [2] [ZapGPT: Free-form Language Prompting for Simulated Cellular Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10660)
*Nam H. Le,Patrick Erickson,Yanbo Zhang,Michael Levin,Josh Bongard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First demonstration that simple agents' collective behavior can be guided by free-form language prompts without task-specific tuning or engineered rewards, using AI models to transform prompts into interventions and score results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between human language expressiveness and artificial/biological systems' ability to interpret it, enabling natural control over complex decentralized systems without engineered rewards or rigid command sets.

Method: Two AI models: one transforms imperative prompts into interventions for simulated cells, another scores how well prompts describe resulting dynamics. The first model is evolved to improve scores from the second, without engineered fitness functions or domain-specific prompt design.

Result: The evolved system generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining, demonstrating that natural language alone can guide collective behavior without task-specific tuning.

Conclusion: Natural language can serve as a control layer, potentially replacing mathematical objective functions and domain-specific programming, representing a concrete step toward AI-biology partnerships where language directs computational, robotic, or biological systems.

Abstract: Human language is one of the most expressive tools for conveying intent, yet
most artificial or biological systems lack mechanisms to interpret or respond
meaningfully to it. Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of
control over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent
work explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still
depend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets,
limiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in
synthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often
genomic rather than environmental perturbation.
  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be
guided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or
carefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by
showing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be
guided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative
prompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI
model scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and
the former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.
  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness
functions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system
generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining. By treating natural language
as a control layer, the system suggests a future in which spoken or written
prompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems to desired
behaviors. This work provides a concrete step toward this vision of AI-biology
partnerships, in which language replaces mathematical objective functions,
fixed rules, and domain-specific programming.

### [3] [Maestro: Self-Improving Text-to-Image Generation via Agent Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10704)
*Xingchen Wan,Han Zhou,Ruoxi Sun,Hootan Nakhost,Ke Jiang,Rajarishi Sinha,Sercan Ö. Arık*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro is a self-evolving image generation system that enables text-to-image models to autonomously improve generated images through iterative prompt evolution, using specialized MLLM agents for self-critique and self-evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models require significant human intervention and manual prompt engineering, posing usability challenges with underspecified prompts.

Method: Uses two key innovations: 1) Self-critique with MLLM agents as critics to identify weaknesses and provide edit signals, 2) Self-evolution using MLLM-as-a-judge for head-to-head comparisons and evolving better prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments show Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with more advanced MLLM components.

Conclusion: Presents a robust, interpretable, and effective pathway towards self-improving text-to-image generation that reduces human intervention.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models, while offering immense creative potential, are
highly reliant on human intervention, posing significant usability challenges
that often necessitate manual, iterative prompt engineering over often
underspecified prompts. This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving
image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve
generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial
prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where
specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify
weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide
interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent
while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge
for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing
problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with
user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models
demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial
prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with
more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and
effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.

### [4] [Understanding AI Evaluation Patterns: How Different GPT Models Assess Vision-Language Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10707)
*Sajjad Abdoli,Rudi Cilibrasi,Rima Al-Shikh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI models exhibit distinct evaluation personalities - GPT-4o-mini shows consistency, GPT-4o excels at error detection, GPT-5 is conservative with high variability. GPT models share a 2:1 negative bias and cluster together, while Gemini shows different strategies, indicating evaluation competence doesn't scale with general capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems increasingly evaluate other AI outputs, understanding their assessment behavior is crucial for preventing cascading biases and ensuring reliable AI evaluation systems.

Method: Analyzed vision-language descriptions from NVIDIA's Describe Anything Model evaluated by three GPT variants. Used Gemini 2.5 Pro as independent question generator for controlled experiments. Conducted cross-family analysis through semantic similarity of generated questions.

Result: GPT-4o-mini exhibits systematic consistency, GPT-4o excels at error detection, GPT-5 shows extreme conservatism with high variability. GPT models demonstrate consistent 2:1 bias favoring negative assessment and cluster together with high similarity, while Gemini exhibits markedly different evaluation strategies.

Conclusion: Evaluation competence does not scale with general capability, and robust AI assessment requires diverse architectural perspectives to prevent systematic biases and ensure comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly evaluate other AI outputs, understanding their
assessment behavior becomes crucial for preventing cascading biases. This study
analyzes vision-language descriptions generated by NVIDIA's Describe Anything
Model and evaluated by three GPT variants (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5) to
uncover distinct "evaluation personalities" the underlying assessment
strategies and biases each model demonstrates. GPT-4o-mini exhibits systematic
consistency with minimal variance, GPT-4o excels at error detection, while
GPT-5 shows extreme conservatism with high variability. Controlled experiments
using Gemini 2.5 Pro as an independent question generator validate that these
personalities are inherent model properties rather than artifacts. Cross-family
analysis through semantic similarity of generated questions reveals significant
divergence: GPT models cluster together with high similarity while Gemini
exhibits markedly different evaluation strategies. All GPT models demonstrate a
consistent 2:1 bias favoring negative assessment over positive confirmation,
though this pattern appears family-specific rather than universal across AI
architectures. These findings suggest that evaluation competence does not scale
with general capability and that robust AI assessment requires diverse
architectural perspectives.

### [5] [AgentArch: A Comprehensive Benchmark to Evaluate Agent Architectures in Enterprise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10769)
*Tara Bogavelli,Roshnee Sharma,Hari Subramani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Enterprise benchmark study of 18 agentic configurations across LLMs reveals model-specific architectural preferences and poor performance (max 35.3% on complex tasks), challenging one-size-fits-all approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited empirical understanding of how different design dimensions interact in complex multi-agent systems, despite isolated studies of individual components.

Method: Comprehensive enterprise-specific benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art LLMs, examining four dimensions: orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct vs function calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration.

Result: Revealed significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge one-size-fits-all paradigm. Found significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance with highest scoring models achieving only 35.3% success on complex tasks and 70.8% on simpler tasks.

Conclusion: Findings should inform future agentic system design by enabling more empirically backed decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.

Abstract: While individual components of agentic architectures have been studied in
isolation, there remains limited empirical understanding of how different
design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems. This study aims
to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific
benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art
large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions:
orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function
calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark
reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the
prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals
significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with
the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the
more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform
the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed
decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.

### [6] [AI Answer Engine Citation Behavior An Empirical Analysis of the GEO16 Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10762)
*Arlen Kumar,Leanid Palkhouski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GEO-16 framework audits web page quality for AI citation, finding that higher quality pages (especially with good metadata, semantic HTML, and structured data) are more likely to be cited by AI engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI answer engines select and cite web sources, and to develop a framework for evaluating the quality of pages that get cited.

Method: Developed GEO-16 framework with 16 quality pillars, collected 1,702 citations from 3 AI engines using 70 prompts, and audited 1,100 unique URLs using logistic models with domain clustered standard errors.

Result: Engines differed in citation quality, with metadata/freshness, semantic HTML, and structured data being strongest predictors. Pages with GEO score ≥0.70 and ≥12 pillar hits had substantially higher citation rates.

Conclusion: Overall page quality strongly predicts citation likelihood. Findings provide practical guidance for publishers to improve their content's chances of being cited by AI engines.

Abstract: AI answer engines increasingly mediate access to domain knowledge by
generating responses and citing web sources. We introduce GEO-16, a 16 pillar
auditing framework that converts on page quality signals into banded pillar
scores and a normalized GEO score G that ranges from 0 to 1. Using 70 product
intent prompts, we collected 1,702 citations across three engines (Brave
Summary, Google AI Overviews, and Perplexity) and audited 1,100 unique URLs. In
our corpus, the engines differed in the GEO quality of the pages they cited,
and pillars related to Metadata and Freshness, Semantic HTML, and Structured
Data showed the strongest associations with citation. Logistic models with
domain clustered standard errors indicate that overall page quality is a strong
predictor of citation, and simple operating points (for example, G at least
0.70 combined with at least 12 pillar hits) align with substantially higher
citation rates in our data. We report per engine contrasts, vertical effects,
threshold analysis, and diagnostics, then translate findings into a practical
playbook for publishers. The study is observational and focuses on English
language B2B SaaS pages; we discuss limitations, threats to validity, and
reproducibility considerations.

### [7] [Agentic Lybic: Multi-Agent Execution System with Tiered Reasoning and Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11067)
*Liangxuan Guo,Bin Zhu,Qingqian Tao,Kangning Liu,Xun Zhao,Xianzhe Qin,Jin Gao,Guangfu Hao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic Lybic is a multi-agent system using finite-state machine architecture for desktop automation, achieving 57.07% success rate on OSWorld benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous agents struggle with complex multi-step desktop tasks due to poor coordination and inadequate quality control.

Method: Four-component FSM-based system: Controller, Manager, three Workers (Technician, Operator, Analyst), and Evaluator with dynamic routing between components for optimal execution strategy selection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 57.07% success rate in 50 steps on OSWorld benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Principled multi-agent orchestration with continuous quality control provides superior reliability for generalized desktop automation in complex computing environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for desktop automation struggle with complex multi-step
tasks due to poor coordination and inadequate quality control. We introduce
\textsc{Agentic Lybic}, a novel multi-agent system where the entire
architecture operates as a finite-state machine (FSM). This core innovation
enables dynamic orchestration. Our system comprises four components: a
Controller, a Manager, three Workers (Technician for code-based operations,
Operator for GUI interactions, and Analyst for decision support), and an
Evaluator. The critical mechanism is the FSM-based routing between these
components, which provides flexibility and generalization by dynamically
selecting the optimal execution strategy for each subtask. This principled
orchestration, combined with robust quality gating, enables adaptive replanning
and error recovery. Evaluated officially on the OSWorld benchmark,
\textsc{Agentic Lybic} achieves a state-of-the-art 57.07\% success rate in 50
steps, substantially outperforming existing methods. Results demonstrate that
principled multi-agent orchestration with continuous quality control provides
superior reliability for generalized desktop automation in complex computing
environments.

### [8] [Neural cellular automata: applications to biology and beyond classical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11131)
*Benedikt Hartl,Michael Levin,Léo Pio-Lopez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) combine trainable neural networks with cellular automata to model biological self-organization across multiple scales, showing robustness and adaptation capabilities with applications in biology, robotics, and AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework that captures adaptive self-regulatory dynamics of living matter and bridges biological insights with modern AI, enabling multiscale modeling of evolution, development, regeneration, and intelligent control systems.

Method: Embedding Artificial Neural Networks as local decision-making centers within cellular automata, creating differentiable and evolvable update rules that operate through localized interactions to produce coordinated system-level outcomes.

Result: NCAs successfully reproduce biological patterns, generalize to novel conditions, demonstrate robustness to perturbations, and show capabilities in robotic control, morphological regeneration, and reasoning tasks like ARC-AGI-1.

Conclusion: NCAs represent a unifying computationally efficient paradigm that connects multiscale biology with generative AI, offering potential for designing bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning and control.

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) represent a powerful framework for modeling
biological self-organization, extending classical rule-based systems with
trainable, differentiable (or evolvable) update rules that capture the adaptive
self-regulatory dynamics of living matter. By embedding Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) as local decision-making centers and interaction rules between
localized agents, NCA can simulate processes across molecular, cellular,
tissue, and system-level scales, offering a multiscale competency architecture
perspective on evolution, development, regeneration, aging, morphogenesis, and
robotic control. These models not only reproduce biologically inspired target
patterns but also generalize to novel conditions, demonstrating robustness to
perturbations and the capacity for open-ended adaptation and reasoning. Given
their immense success in recent developments, we here review current literature
of NCAs that are relevant primarily for biological or bioengineering
applications. Moreover, we emphasize that beyond biology, NCAs display robust
and generalizing goal-directed dynamics without centralized control, e.g., in
controlling or regenerating composite robotic morphologies or even on
cutting-edge reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI-1. In addition, the same
principles of iterative state-refinement is reminiscent to modern generative
Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as probabilistic diffusion models. Their
governing self-regulatory behavior is constraint to fully localized
interactions, yet their collective behavior scales into coordinated
system-level outcomes. We thus argue that NCAs constitute a unifying
computationally lean paradigm that not only bridges fundamental insights from
multiscale biology with modern generative AI, but have the potential to design
truly bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning
and control.

### [9] [LLM Enhancement with Domain Expert Mental Model to Reduce LLM Hallucination with Causal Prompt Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10818)
*Boris Kovalerchuk,Brent D. Fegley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with decision-making due to missing information and hallucinations. The paper proposes an Expert Mental Model (EMM) algorithm using human-machine dialogue and Boolean functions to create structured decision models for LLM prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limitations in handling missing information and complex decision-making tasks, especially when critical information is absent or poorly documented in available sources. Existing methods like RAG are only partial solutions.

Method: Proposes a 4-step EMM algorithm: (1) factor identification, (2) hierarchical structuring of factors, (3) generating generalized expert mental model specification, (4) creating detailed generalized expert mental model from specification. Uses optimized human-machine dialogue and monotone Boolean/k-valued functions.

Result: The approach aims to discover computationally tractable personal expert mental models for decision-making, making LLMs more effective in handling complex decision tasks with missing information.

Conclusion: The proposed EMM framework provides a systematic way to capture expert knowledge and mental models, enabling LLMs to handle decision-making tasks more efficiently despite information gaps and limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Difficult decision-making problems abound in various disciplines and domains.
The proliferation of generative techniques, especially large language models
(LLMs), has excited interest in using them for decision support. However, LLMs
cannot yet resolve missingness in their training data, leading to
hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by
incorporating external information retrieval, reducing hallucinations and
improving accuracy. Yet, RAG and related methods are only partial solutions, as
they may lack access to all necessary sources or key missing information. Even
everyday issues often challenge LLMs' abilities. Submitting longer prompts with
context and examples is one approach to address knowledge gaps, but designing
effective prompts is non-trivial and may not capture complex mental models of
domain experts. For tasks with missing critical information, LLMs are
insufficient, as are many existing systems poorly represented in available
documents. This paper explores how LLMs can make decision-making more
efficient, using a running example of evaluating whether to respond to a call
for proposals. We propose a technology based on optimized human-machine
dialogue and monotone Boolean and k-valued functions to discover a
computationally tractable personal expert mental model (EMM) of
decision-making. Our EMM algorithm for LLM prompt engineering has four steps:
(1) factor identification, (2) hierarchical structuring of factors, (3)
generating a generalized expert mental model specification, and (4) generating
a detailed generalized expert mental model from that specification.

### [10] [AMLNet: A Knowledge-Based Multi-Agent Framework to Generate and Detect Realistic Money Laundering Transactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11595)
*Sabin Huda,Ernest Foo,Zahra Jadidi,MA Hakim Newton,Abdul Sattar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AMLNet is a knowledge-based multi-agent framework that generates synthetic anti-money laundering transaction data and provides ensemble detection, addressing the lack of publicly shareable AML datasets while maintaining regulatory alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anti-money laundering research is constrained by the lack of publicly shareable, regulation-aligned transaction datasets that can be used for reproducible experimentation.

Method: A knowledge-based multi-agent framework with two coordinated units: a regulation-aware transaction generator and an ensemble detection pipeline. The generator produces synthetic transactions spanning core laundering phases and advanced typologies.

Result: Generated 1,090,173 synthetic transactions (0.16% laundering-positive) with 75% regulatory alignment based on AUSTRAC rules. Detection ensemble achieved F1 score of 0.90 (precision 0.84, recall 0.97) on internal tests and adapted well to external datasets.

Conclusion: AMLNet provides a comprehensive solution for reproducible AML research with regulatory alignment, offering synthetic data and detection capabilities that advance regulation-conscious anti-money laundering experimentation.

Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) research is constrained by the lack of publicly
shareable, regulation-aligned transaction datasets. We present AMLNet, a
knowledge-based multi-agent framework with two coordinated units: a
regulation-aware transaction generator and an ensemble detection pipeline. The
generator produces 1,090,173 synthetic transactions (approximately 0.16\%
laundering-positive) spanning core laundering phases (placement, layering,
integration) and advanced typologies (e.g., structuring, adaptive threshold
behavior). Regulatory alignment reaches 75\% based on AUSTRAC rule coverage
(Section 4.2), while a composite technical fidelity score of 0.75 summarizes
temporal, structural, and behavioral realism components (Section 4.4). The
detection ensemble achieves F1 0.90 (precision 0.84, recall 0.97) on the
internal test partitions of AMLNet and adapts to the external SynthAML dataset,
indicating architectural generalizability across different synthetic generation
paradigms. We provide multi-dimensional evaluation (regulatory, temporal,
network, behavioral) and release the dataset (Version 1.0,
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16736515), to advance reproducible and
regulation-conscious AML experimentation.

### [11] [From Grounding to Skolemization: A Logic-Constrained Vector Symbolic Architecture for Complex Query Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10837)
*Yuyin Lu,Hegang Chen,Yanghui Rao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LVSA is a neuro-symbolic framework that combines differentiable Skolemization with neural negation to efficiently answer complex queries over incomplete knowledge graphs while maintaining logical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental trade-off between logical soundness and computational efficiency in Complex Query Answering over incomplete Knowledge Graphs, where existing methods either suffer from combinatorial explosion or compromise logical consistency.

Method: Proposes Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic Architecture (LVSA) with a differentiable Skolemization module, neural negator, and logical constraint-driven optimization to harmonize geometric and logical requirements.

Result: Theoretically guarantees universality for all EFO$_1$ queries. Empirically outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to Grounding-based baselines.

Conclusion: LVSA successfully addresses the limitations of both Grounding-based and Skolemization-based methods by providing a unified neuro-symbolic framework that maintains logical consistency while achieving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs),
typically formalized as reasoning with Existential First-Order predicate logic
with one free variable (EFO$_1$), faces a fundamental trade-off between logical
soundness and computational efficiency. This work establishes the
Grounding-Skolemization dichotomy for systematically analyzing CQA methods
through the lens of formal logic. While Grounding-based methods inherently
suffer from combinatorial explosion, most Skolemization-based methods neglect
to explicitly model Skolem functions and compromise logical consistency. To
address these limitations, we propose the Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic
Architecture (LVSA), a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies a differentiable
Skolemization module and a neural negator, as well as a logical
constraint-driven optimization protocol to harmonize geometric and logical
requirements. Theoretically, LVSA guarantees universality for all EFO$_1$
queries. Empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based
methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to
Grounding-based baselines.

### [12] [Neuro-Symbolic Agents with Modal Logic for Autonomous Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11943)
*Antonin Sulc,Thorsten Hellert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture using Kripke models and modal logic to enhance LM reasoning with formal constraints, preventing illogical conclusions in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scaling approaches focus on model and dataset size but neglect scaling the structure and logical consistency of agent reasoning in challenging environments.

Method: Introduces a neuro-symbolic architecture where agent belief states are represented as Kripke models, enabling modal logic reasoning about possibility and necessity with domain-specific logical constraints.

Result: Successfully diagnoses complex cascading failures in a simulated particle accelerator environment by combining LM semantic intuition with rigorous modal logic validation.

Conclusion: Provides a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents through formal reasoning constraints that prevent physically or logically untenable conclusions.

Abstract: The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language
models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require
intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing
grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit
very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous
capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets
has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the
structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these
environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This
paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief
states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This
foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of
\emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal
logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make
infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for
proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively
guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from
reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity
simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses
complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs
with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world
model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable
autonomous agents.

### [13] [Is the `Agent' Paradigm a Limiting Framework for Next-Generation Intelligent Systems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10875)
*Jesse Gardner,Vladimir A. Baulin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critically re-evaluates the agent-centric paradigm in AI, arguing that its ambiguities and anthropocentric biases limit progress. It proposes shifting focus to system-level dynamics and non-agentic frameworks for developing more robust general intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the dominant agent-centric paradigm in AI research, which the authors argue suffers from conceptual ambiguities and anthropocentric biases that may hinder the development of more effective forms of artificial intelligence.

Method: Systematic literature review and conceptual analysis that distinguishes between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency), agential systems (fully autonomous biological systems), and non-agentic systems (tools without agency impression). The analysis deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks.

Result: The analysis reveals challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and goal-directedness in AI systems. The agentic framing of many AI systems, particularly LLMs, can be misleading and obscure underlying computational mechanisms.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks inspired by complex systems, biology, and unconventional computing is essential for advancing towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general intelligence, requiring new architectures and a fundamental reconsideration of intelligence itself.

Abstract: The concept of the 'agent' has profoundly shaped Artificial Intelligence (AI)
research, guiding development from foundational theories to contemporary
applications like Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems. This paper
critically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric
paradigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent
anthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish
between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g.,
LLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems,
currently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the
impression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant
literature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks,
highlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and
goal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems,
while heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying
computational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an
alternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in
system-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude
that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex
systems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing
towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general
intelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental
reconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the
agent metaphor.

### [14] [Co-Alignment: Rethinking Alignment as Bidirectional Human-AI Cognitive Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12179)
*Yubo Li,Weiyi Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BiCA enables bidirectional co-alignment where humans and AI mutually adapt through learnable protocols, representation mapping, and KL constraints, achieving superior collaboration and safety compared to traditional single-directional alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF follows single-directional alignment where AI conforms to human preferences while treating human cognition as fixed, which limits optimal collaboration potential.

Method: Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment (BiCA) uses learnable protocols, representation mapping between human and AI cognitive spaces, and KL-budget constraints to enable controlled co-evolution and mutual adaptation.

Result: Achieved 85.5% success in collaborative navigation (vs 70.3% baseline), 230% better mutual adaptation, 332% better protocol convergence, 84% improvement over handcrafted protocols, and 23% better out-of-distribution robustness.

Conclusion: Optimal collaboration exists at the intersection (not union) of human and AI capabilities, validating the shift from single-directional to co-alignment paradigms with demonstrated synergy improvement of 46%.

Abstract: Current AI alignment through RLHF follows a single directional paradigm that
AI conforms to human preferences while treating human cognition as fixed. We
propose a shift to co-alignment through Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment
(BiCA), where humans and AI mutually adapt. BiCA uses learnable protocols,

### [15] [Harmful Prompt Laundering: Jailbreaking LLMs with Abductive Styles and Symbolic Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10931)
*Seongho Joo,Hyukhun Koh,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HaPLa is a novel jailbreak attack method that uses abductive framing and symbolic encoding to bypass LLM safety filters with over 95% success on GPT models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic weaknesses in LLM architecture and learning paradigms to strengthen defenses against misuse.

Method: Uses two strategies: 1) abductive framing - instructing LLMs to infer intermediate steps toward harmful activities, and 2) symbolic encoding - obfuscating harmful content to bypass keyword filters.

Result: Achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series models and 70% across all target models. Shows current LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords.

Conclusion: Reveals fundamental challenge: it's difficult to safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in responding to benign queries.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, but their potential misuse for harmful purposes remains a
significant concern. To strengthen defenses against such vulnerabilities, it is
essential to investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic
weaknesses in the architecture and learning paradigms of LLMs. In response, we
propose \textbf{H}armful \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{La}undering (HaPLa), a novel
and broadly applicable jailbreaking technique that requires only black-box
access to target models. HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1)
\textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible
intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding
to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight
and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current
LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental
results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series
models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic
encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to
safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in
responding to benign queries.

*Seongho Joo,Hyukhun Koh,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A private in-context learning algorithm that incorporates task-related public data to balance privacy protection and utility while maintaining differential privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy risks of data leakage in in-context learning while overcoming the utility reduction typically associated with differential privacy.

Method: Incorporates task-related public data into the ICL framework while maintaining differential privacy guarantees, creating a private ICL algorithm.

Result: Significantly improves utility of private ICL with public data assistance and demonstrates robustness against membership inference attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances privacy protection and model utility in in-context learning, providing empirical privacy protection while maintaining practical usefulness.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown
remarkable performance across various tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, recent studies have highlighted the risk of private data leakage
through the prompt in ICL, especially when LLMs are exposed to malicious
attacks. While differential privacy (DP) provides strong privacy guarantees, it
often significantly reduces the utility of in-context learning (ICL). To
address this challenge, we incorporate task-related public data into the ICL
framework while maintaining the DP guarantee. Based on this approach, we
propose a private in-context learning algorithm that effectively balances
privacy protection and model utility. Through experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves the utility of private ICL with the
assistance of public data. Additionally, we show that our method is robust
against membership inference attacks, demonstrating empirical privacy
protection.

### [17] [Enhancing Computational Cognitive Architectures with LLMs: A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10972)
*Ron Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Integrating LLMs into cognitive architectures to enhance computational capabilities while maintaining psychological realism, using Clarion as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cognitive architectures have limited computational power despite psychological plausibility, while LLMs offer superior computational capabilities. Combining them addresses both real-world complexity and psychological realism.

Method: Synergistic combination of Clarion cognitive architecture with LLMs, leveraging Clarion's implicit-explicit dichotomy for seamless integration.

Result: Successful integration that combines LLMs' computational power with Clarion's psychological nicety.

Conclusion: Incorporating LLMs into cognitive architectures is an important approach for achieving both computational capability and psychological realism in modeling human cognition.

Abstract: Computational cognitive architectures are broadly scoped models of the human
mind that combine different psychological functionalities (as well as often
different computational methods for these different functionalities) into one
unified framework. They structure them in a psychologically plausible and
validated way. However, such models thus far have only limited computational
capabilities, mostly limited by the computational tools and techniques that
were adopted. More recently, LLMs have proved to be more capable
computationally than any other tools. Thus, in order to deal with both
real-world complexity and psychological realism at the same time, incorporating
LLMs into cognitive architectures naturally becomes an important task. In the
present article, a synergistic combination of the Clarion cognitive
architecture and LLMs is discussed as a case study. The implicit-explicit
dichotomy that is fundamental to Clarion is leveraged for a seamless
integration of Clarion and LLMs. As a result, computational power of LLMs is
combined with psychological nicety of Clarion.

*Ziang Li,Manasi Ganti,Zixian Ma,Helena Vasconcelos,Qijia He,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fine-grained attribute-based evaluation framework for LLM-generated rationales, moving beyond binary preference judgments to provide more nuanced insights into rationale quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLM-generated rationales rely on opaque binary preference judgments that offer limited insight into what makes one rationale better than another, creating a need for more interpretable and granular evaluation approaches.

Method: The authors identify key rationale attributes from literature, assess them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations, analyze human preference datasets using SHAP to identify important attributes, and re-evaluate rationales using attribute-specific ELO scores.

Result: The analysis reveals that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize rationale quality and provide more nuanced model comparisons, overcoming limitations of binary preference judgments.

Conclusion: Attribute-based evaluation offers a more interpretable and reliable approach for assessing LLM-generated rationales, providing guidance for future research on rationale quality assessment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate natural language rationales --
free-form explanations that help improve performance on complex reasoning tasks
and enhance interpretability for human users. However, evaluating these
rationales remains challenging. While recent work has relied on binary
preference judgments from humans or LLM judges, such evaluations are often
opaque and coarse-grained, offering limited insight into what makes one
rationale better than another. In this work, we rethink preference evaluation
for LLM-generated rationales by asking: (1) What attributes define good
rationales? (2) Can human preferences be explained by these attributes? (3) Can
attribute-based evaluation overcome the limitations of binary comparisons? We
identify a set of key rationale attributes from prior literature and assess
them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations. We then
analyze two standard human preference datasets MT Bench and Chatbot Arena using
SHAP to identify which attributes best explain human preference outcomes.
Finally, we re-evaluate model-generated rationales using attribute-specific ELO
scores, revealing more nuanced model comparisons and insights. Our findings
suggest that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize
rationale quality and guide future research toward more interpretable and
reliable evaluation practices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Free-MAD is a novel multi-agent debate framework that eliminates consensus requirements, uses score-based decision making on entire debate trajectories, and introduces anti-conformity to improve reasoning while reducing token costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent debate methods face limitations including high token overhead from multiple rounds, error propagation due to LLM conformity, and unfair decision-making through majority voting.

Method: Proposes Free-MAD framework with score-based decision mechanism that evaluates entire debate trajectories, anti-conformity mechanism to mitigate majority influence, and requires only single-round debate.

Result: Experiments on eight benchmark datasets show significant reasoning performance improvement, reduced token costs, and improved robustness in real-world attack scenarios compared to existing MAD approaches.

Conclusion: Free-MAD effectively addresses limitations of consensus-based multi-agent debate by eliminating consensus requirements while improving performance, fairness, and efficiency through trajectory-based scoring and anti-conformity mechanisms.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) is an emerging approach to improving the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing MAD methods rely on
multiple rounds of interaction among agents to reach consensus, and the final
output is selected by majority voting in the last round. However, this
consensus-based design faces several limitations. First, multiple rounds of
communication increases token overhead and limits scalability. Second, due to
the inherent conformity of LLMs, agents that initially produce correct
responses may be influenced by incorrect ones during the debate process,
causing error propagation. Third, majority voting introduces randomness and
unfairness in the decision-making phase, and can degrade the reasoning
performance.
  To address these issues, we propose \textsc{Free-MAD}, a novel MAD framework
that eliminates the need for consensus among agents. \textsc{Free-MAD}
introduces a novel score-based decision mechanism that evaluates the entire
debate trajectory rather than relying on the last round only. This mechanism
tracks how each agent's reasoning evolves, enabling more accurate and fair
outcomes. In addition, \textsc{Free-MAD} reconstructs the debate phase by
introducing anti-conformity, a mechanism that enables agents to mitigate
excessive influence from the majority. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets
demonstrate that \textsc{Free-MAD} significantly improves reasoning performance
while requiring only a single-round debate and thus reducing token costs. We
also show that compared to existing MAD approaches, \textsc{Free-MAD} exhibits
improved robustness in real-world attack scenarios.

*Zan-Kai Chong,Hiroyuki Ohsaki,Bryan Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A verification framework for LLM outputs that enables efficient probabilistic auditing with asymmetric effort - verification is much cheaper than computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of computational trust in multi-agent LLM systems, ensuring outputs are genuinely produced by claimed models rather than falsified or generated by inferior/cheaper models.

Method: Built on deterministic replicability principle requiring homogeneous hardware/software environment. Uses probabilistic auditing of small random output segments with distributed verification workload.

Result: Simulations show targeted verification can be over 12x faster than full regeneration, with tunable parameters for detection probability.

Conclusion: Provides tractable mechanism for auditable LLM systems, serving as foundation for responsible AI and future research in complex heterogeneous multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) shifts rapidly towards dynamic,
multi-agent systems. This introduces a fundamental challenge in establishing
computational trust, specifically how one agent can verify that another's
output was genuinely produced by a claimed LLM, and not falsified or generated
by a cheaper or inferior model. To address this challenge, this paper proposes
a verification framework that achieves tractable asymmetric effort, where the
cost to verify a computation is substantially lower than the cost to perform
it. Our approach is built upon the principle of deterministic replicability, a
property inherent to autoregressive models that strictly necessitates a
computationally homogeneous environment where all agents operate on identical
hardware and software stacks. Within this defined context, our framework
enables multiple validators to probabilistically audit small, random segments
of an LLM's output and it distributes the verification workload effectively.
The simulations demonstrated that targeted verification can be over 12 times
faster than full regeneration, with tunable parameters to adjust the detection
probability. By establishing a tractable mechanism for auditable LLM systems,
our work offers a foundational layer for responsible AI and serves as a
cornerstone for future research into the more complex, heterogeneous
multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based medical data generation methods have limitations in privacy, accuracy, diversity, and lack realistic patient interaction capabilities.

Method: Medically-aligned multi-step generation architecture with hierarchical medical knowledge injection, dynamic updating mechanism for consistency, and real-time clinical plausibility verification.

Result: Achieves good performance in accuracy, diversity, and consistency. Training with generated virtual patients significantly improves existing models on MedQA dataset.

Conclusion: Patient-Zero provides a privacy-preserving solution for realistic patient data generation that enhances medical AI model performance without using real medical records.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation using large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a
promising solution across various domains, particularly in medical field, to
mitigate data collection challenges. However, existing studies mainly utilize
LLMs to rewrite and complete existing medical records, where the limitations in
data privacy, accuracy, and diversity sill exist, and additionally lack the
ability to interact like real patients. To address these issues, we propose a
realistic patient generation framework, Patient-Zero, which requires no real
medical records. Patient-Zero first introduces a medically-aligned multi-step
generation architecture, which builds comprehensive patient records through
hierarchical medical knowledge injection without real medical records. Then, to
optimize the virtual patient's interaction abilities with humans, Patient-Zero
designs a dynamic updating mechanism to improve the consistency and
conversational performance. Our framework enables the generation of
contextually diverse patient records while maintaining strict medical
coherence, supported by adaptive dialogue strategies and real-time clinical
plausibility verification. Experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves good performance in accuracy, diversity, and consistency. After
training with our generated virtual patients, existing models show significant
improvements on the MedQA dataset.

Motivation: Existing multi-agent frameworks use static workflows that either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, and neglect efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs.

Method: Proposes Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO) with three modules: VAE for difficulty estimation, modular operator allocator, and cost-performance aware LLM router to dynamically tailor workflows.

Result: DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies by leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamic workflow adaptation based on query difficulty.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong
capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks
often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple
queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the
efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a
dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM
assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three
interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty
estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM
router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows,
DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO
outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency
across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KT models focus too much on fitting interaction sequences while overlooking the knowledge state itself, leading to reduced interpretability and insufficient instructional support in intelligent tutoring systems.

Method: Uses frontend-to-backend architecture to model stable knowledge state, defines ideal knowledge state based on pedagogical theories as alignment criterion, employs five encoders and contrastive learning module to enhance alignment robustness.

Result: Outperforms seven KT baselines on three real-world datasets, achieves state-of-the-art results on two datasets and competitive performance on the third.

Conclusion: AlignKT successfully addresses the limitation of existing KT models by explicitly modeling knowledge states with pedagogical alignment, resulting in improved performance and interpretability for intelligent tutoring systems.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) serves as a fundamental component of Intelligent
Tutoring Systems (ITS), enabling these systems to monitor and understand
learners' progress by modeling their knowledge state. However, many existing KT
models primarily focus on fitting the sequences of learners' interactions, and
often overlook the knowledge state itself. This limitation leads to reduced
interpretability and insufficient instructional support from the ITS. To
address this challenge, we propose AlignKT, which employs a frontend-to-backend
architecture to explicitly model a stable knowledge state. In this approach,
the preliminary knowledge state is aligned with an additional criterion.
Specifically, we define an ideal knowledge state based on pedagogical theories
as the alignment criterion, providing a foundation for interpretability. We
utilize five encoders to implement this set-up, and incorporate a contrastive
learning module to enhance the robustness of the alignment process. Through
extensive experiments, AlignKT demonstrates superior performance, outperforming
seven KT baselines on three real-world datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art
results on two of these datasets and exhibits competitive performance on the
third. The code of this work is available at

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms existing commercial scientific video generation services and approaches human-level quality in scientific communication.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenges of automated scientific video generation with personalized dynamic orchestration and multimodal synchronization, demonstrated through comprehensive evaluation including the proposed SciVidEval benchmark.

Abstract: Automating the generation of scientific videos is a crucial yet challenging

automation primarily focus on static media such as posters and slides, lacking
mechanisms for personalized dynamic orchestration and multimodal content
synchronization. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoAgent, a novel

asset library and, guided by user requirements, orchestrates a narrative flow
that synthesizes both static slides and dynamic animations to explain complex
concepts. To enable rigorous evaluation, we also propose SciVidEval, the first
comprehensive suite for this task, which combines automated metrics for
multimodal content quality and synchronization with a Video-Quiz-based human

that our method significantly outperforms existing commercial scientific video

TL;DR: A novel alignment framework that uses LLMs as agent proxies for human survey respondents to address cost and demographic imbalance issues in social science surveys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve rising survey deployment costs and demographic imbalance in survey response data by using LLMs as cost-effective, steerable proxies for human respondents.

Method: P2P system with two-stage alignment: constructing diverse agent personas (endowments) and selecting representative subsets using structured prompt engineering, entropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection.

Result: Aligned agent populations reproduce aggregate response patterns with high fidelity and exhibit substantial response diversity without demographic conditioning.

Conclusion: The framework provides a cost-effective solution for social science research while serving as a testbed for studying pluralistic alignment operationalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in emulating
human-like responses across a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel alignment framework that treats LLMs as agent proxies for human survey
respondents, affording a cost-effective and steerable solution to two pressing
challenges in the social sciences: the rising cost of survey deployment and the
growing demographic imbalance in survey response data. Drawing inspiration from
the theory of revealed preference, we formulate alignment as a two-stage
problem: constructing diverse agent personas called endowments that simulate
plausible respondent profiles, and selecting a representative subset to
approximate a ground-truth population based on observed data. To implement the
paradigm, we introduce P2P, a system that steers LLM agents toward
representative behavioral patterns using structured prompt engineering,
entropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection. Unlike
personalization-heavy approaches, our alignment approach is
demographic-agnostic and relies only on aggregate survey results, offering
better generalizability and parsimony. Beyond improving data efficiency in
social science research, our framework offers a testbed for studying the
operationalization of pluralistic alignment. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach on real-world opinion survey datasets, showing that our aligned agent
populations can reproduce aggregate response patterns with high fidelity and
exhibit substantial response diversity, even without demographic conditioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the accumulation of micro- and nano-plastics in the environment and their serious health risks by developing a systematic approach to extract and structure complex cause-effect relationships from scientific literature.

Method: Leverage large language models to extract relational metapaths (multi-hop semantic chains) from abstracts, construct Toxicity Trajectory Graphs tracing pollutant propagation, and incorporate dynamic evidence reconciliation to resolve semantic conflicts from evolving research.

Result: The approach demonstrates strong performance in extracting reliable, high-utility relational knowledge from noisy scientific text and provides a scalable solution for mining complex cause-effect structures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers an effective and scalable method for extracting structured knowledge about pollutant-health relationships from scientific literature, with applications in domain-specific corpora mining and environmental health research.

Abstract: The widespread use of plastics and their persistence in the environment have
led to the accumulation of micro- and nano-plastics across air, water, and
soil, posing serious health risks including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and
neurological disorders. We propose a novel framework that leverages large
language models to extract relational metapaths, multi-hop semantic chains
linking pollutant sources to health impacts, from scientific abstracts. Our
system identifies and connects entities across diverse contexts to construct
structured relational metapaths, which are aggregated into a Toxicity
Trajectory Graph that traces pollutant propagation through exposure routes and
biological systems. Moreover, to ensure consistency and reliability, we
incorporate a dynamic evidence reconciliation module that resolves semantic
conflicts arising from evolving or contradictory research findings. Our
approach demonstrates strong performance in extracting reliable, high-utility
relational knowledge from noisy scientific text and offers a scalable solution
for mining complex cause-effect structures in domain-specific corpora.

*William Farlessyost,Sebastian Oberst,Shweta Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework using liquid-time constant networks for dynamic causality analysis to optimize observer-based soft sensors by identifying minimal sensor sets through iterative pruning of inputs with negligible causal impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sensor selection methods based on linearized observability indices or statistical correlations fail to capture temporal evolution in complex systems, creating a need for dynamic causality analysis.

Method: Uses LTC networks with input-dependent time constants to implement iterative workflow: train observer, quantify causal impact via perturbation analysis, prune negligible inputs, and retrain until performance degradation occurs.

Result: The approach consistently identifies minimal sensor sets that align with underlying physics while improving prediction accuracy across three testbeds (spring-mass-damper, nonlinear reactor, and predator-prey models).

Conclusion: The causality-guided pruning framework enhances interpretability by grounding sensor selection in dynamic causal relationships rather than static correlations, offering benefits for soft sensing in process engineering, ecological monitoring, and agriculture.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for optimizing observer-based soft
sensors through dynamic causality analysis. Traditional approaches to sensor
selection often rely on linearized observability indices or statistical
correlations that fail to capture the temporal evolution of complex systems. We
address this gap by leveraging liquid-time constant (LTC) networks,
continuous-time neural architectures with input-dependent time constants, to
systematically identify and prune sensor inputs with minimal causal influence
on state estimation. Our methodology implements an iterative workflow: training
an LTC observer on candidate inputs, quantifying each input's causal impact
through controlled perturbation analysis, removing inputs with negligible
effect, and retraining until performance degradation occurs. We demonstrate
this approach on three mechanistic testbeds representing distinct physical
domains: a harmonically forced spring-mass-damper system, a nonlinear
continuous stirred-tank reactor, and a predator-prey model following the
structure of the Lotka-Volterra model, but with seasonal forcing and added
complexity. Results show that our causality-guided pruning consistently
identifies minimal sensor sets that align with underlying physics while
improving prediction accuracy. The framework automatically distinguishes
essential physical measurements from noise and determines when derived
interaction terms provide complementary versus redundant information. Beyond
computational efficiency, this approach enhances interpretability by grounding
sensor selection decisions in dynamic causal relationships rather than static
correlations, offering significant benefits for soft sensing applications
across process engineering, ecological monitoring, and agricultural domains.

for efficient exploration-exploitation; and theoretical convergence guarantees.
Experiments on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks show MAPGD
outperforms single-agent and random baselines in accuracy and efficiency.
Ablations confirm the benefits of gradient fusion, agent specialization, and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes RBAC framework for AI agent security to address prompt injection vulnerabilities in industrial deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have static training data limitations and require fine-tuning, while AI agents using LLMs face security threats like prompt injection attacks that compromise integrity and reliability.

Method: Framework for integrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents to provide robust security guardrails.

Result: Not specified in abstract - framework aims to support effective and scalable deployment of AI agents with focus on on-premises implementations.

Conclusion: RBAC integration addresses security vulnerabilities in AI agents, enabling safer industrial deployment and mitigating risks from prompt injection attacks.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
solutions across various domains, from political science to software
development. However, these models are constrained by their training data,
which is static and limited to information available up to a specific date.
Additionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning --
whether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform
specific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate
some of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data,
enabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In
industrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing
decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example,
in manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost
productivity and support real-time decision-making. Despite these advancements,
AI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection
attacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for integrating
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents, providing a robust security
guardrail. This framework aims to support the effective and scalable deployment
of AI agents, with a focus on on-premises implementations.

*Chen Jiang,Kofi Osei,Sai Deepthi Yeddula,Dongji Feng,Wei-Shinn Ku*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an Adaptive Mixture of Experts model for precipitation forecasting that handles multi-source heterogeneous data through specialized experts and dynamic routing, achieving superior performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate precipitation forecasting is crucial for agriculture and disaster management, but challenging due to complex climate systems and heterogeneous multi-source data with varying resolutions and domain-specific features that conventional models struggle to integrate effectively.

Method: Developed an Adaptive Mixture of Experts model where each expert specializes in specific modalities or spatio-temporal patterns, incorporating a dynamic router that learns to assign inputs to the most relevant experts, plus an interactive web-based visualization tool for exploring weather patterns.

Result: The Adaptive MoE significantly outperformed all baseline models when evaluated on a curated multimodal climate dataset capturing real-world conditions during Hurricane Ian in 2022, demonstrating enhanced predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed modular design effectively addresses the challenge of integrating heterogeneous multi-source weather data, providing both improved forecasting performance and practical decision-making support through interactive visualization tools for climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is indispensable in agriculture, disaster
management, and sustainable strategies. However, predicting rainfall has been
challenging due to the complexity of climate systems and the heterogeneous
nature of multi-source observational data, including radar, satellite imagery,
and surface-level measurements. The multi-source data vary in spatial and
temporal resolution, and they carry domain-specific features, making it
challenging for effective integration in conventional deep learning models.
Previous research has explored various machine learning techniques for weather
prediction; however, most struggle with the integration of data with
heterogeneous modalities. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive
Mixture of Experts (MoE) model tailored for precipitation rate prediction. Each
expert within the model specializes in a specific modality or spatio-temporal
pattern. We also incorporated a dynamic router that learns to assign inputs to
the most relevant experts. Our results show that this modular design enhances
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In addition to the modeling
framework, we introduced an interactive web-based visualization tool that
enables users to intuitively explore historical weather patterns over time and
space. The tool was designed to support decision-making for stakeholders in
climate-sensitive sectors. We evaluated our approach using a curated multimodal
climate dataset capturing real-world conditions during Hurricane Ian in 2022.
The benchmark results show that the Adaptive MoE significantly outperformed all
the baselines.

TL;DR: Evaluation of 5 VLA models shows architectural choices impact throughput/memory, edge devices can match older datacenter GPUs under power constraints, and high-throughput variants maintain accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models are powerful for robotic control but their performance scaling across architectures/hardware platforms and associated power budgets remain poorly understood.

Method: Evaluated 5 representative VLA models (including state-of-the-art baselines and 2 new architectures) on edge and datacenter GPUs using LIBERO benchmark, measuring accuracy, latency, throughput, and peak memory usage under varying power constraints.

Result: Identified distinct scaling trends: architectural choices strongly influence throughput/memory; edge devices show non-linear performance degradation but can match older datacenter GPUs; high-throughput variants achievable without significant accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for VLA selection/optimization across deployment constraints, challenges assumptions about datacenter hardware superiority for robotic inference.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist
policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model
architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power
budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five
representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly
proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using
the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics,
including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power
constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results
identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action
tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory
footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance
degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter
GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant
accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and
optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges
current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic
inference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedicalOS is an agent-based operational system that translates natural language instructions into predefined healthcare commands, automating clinical workflows while ensuring safety and compliance with clinical guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital health systems are difficult to use, requiring clinicians to manage multiple tools, perform repetitive manual actions, and navigate complex UIs, taking time away from patient care. LLM-based agents show potential for natural language interaction with software systems.

Method: Developed MedicalOS as a domain-specific abstraction layer that translates human instructions into predefined healthcare commands (patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam management, etc.) wrapped as tools using machine languages like Python, APIs, MCP, and Linux.

Result: Validated on 214 patient cases across 22 specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and medication recommendations.

Conclusion: MedicalOS provides a trustworthy and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice by enabling natural language interaction with healthcare systems while maintaining safety and compliance.

Abstract: Decades' advances in digital health technologies, such as electronic health
records, have largely streamlined routine clinical processes. Yet, most these
systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of
managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating
complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on
administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large
language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding
and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with
operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing
agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an
abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language
into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a
more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical
guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and
compliance. To address this need, we present \textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified
agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract
layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital
healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam
management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped
as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP,
Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22
specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically
sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and
medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy
and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.

*Shanmuka Sadhu,Arca Baran,Preeti Pandey,Ayush Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using synthetic data generation (CTGAN, CopulaGAN, Gretel AI) to augment real eye movement data significantly improves task decoding accuracy from 28.1% to 82% with Inception Time, supporting Yarbus' hypothesis that observer tasks can be decoded from eye movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support Yarbus' claim that it's possible to decode observer tasks from eye movements, and address mixed results from traditional ML algorithms by using synthetic data augmentation to improve classification accuracy.

Method: Generated synthetic eye movement data using CTGAN, CopulaGAN, and Gretel AI synthetic data generators on real dataset from user study. Combined real and synthetic data for training various ML algorithms including Random Forest and Inception Time.

Result: Significant improvement from 28.1% accuracy with Random Forest to 82% with Inception Time when augmenting 320 real samples with 5x synthetic data. Framework outperforms all previous studies on the dataset.

Conclusion: Augmenting real eye movement data with synthetically generated data dramatically improves task decoding accuracy, validating Yarbus' hypothesis and demonstrating the effectiveness of synthetic data generation for eye-tracking research.

Abstract: Machine learning has been extensively used in various applications related to
eye-tracking research. Understanding eye movement is one of the most
significant subsets of eye-tracking research that reveals the scanning pattern
of an individual. Researchers have thoroughly analyzed eye movement data to
understand various eye-tracking applications, such as attention mechanisms,
navigational behavior, task understanding, etc. The outcome of traditional
machine learning algorithms used for decoding tasks based on eye movement data
has received a mixed reaction to Yarbus' claim that it is possible to decode
the observer's task from their eye movements. In this paper, to support the
hypothesis by Yarbus, we are decoding tasks categories while generating
synthetic data samples using well-known Synthetic Data Generators CTGAN and its
variations such as CopulaGAN and Gretel AI Synthetic Data generators on
available data from an in-person user study. Our results show that augmenting
more eye movement data combined with additional synthetically generated
improves classification accuracy even with traditional machine learning
algorithms. We see a significant improvement in task decoding accuracy from
28.1% using Random Forest to 82% using Inception Time when five times more data
is added in addition to the 320 real eye movement dataset sample. Our proposed
framework outperforms all the available studies on this dataset because of the
use of additional synthetic datasets. We validated our claim with various
algorithms and combinations of real and synthetic data to show how decoding
accuracy increases with the increase in the augmentation of generated data to
real data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCFR integrates LLMs with model checking for verifiable QA, improving reasoning faithfulness in closed-domain applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce unfaithful reasoning traces, and existing neuro-symbolic approaches struggle with dynamic, state-based reasoning needed for procedural correctness in high-stakes domains.

Method: Proposes MCFR framework that translates natural language into formal specifications and verifies them over transition models using model checking techniques.

Result: MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and interpretability, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude on the EduMC-QA benchmark.

Conclusion: MCFR offers a viable path toward verifiable question answering in high-stakes closed-domain applications by combining LLMs with formal verification methods.

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for closed-domain QA systems in which procedural
correctness and policy compliance are critical. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work
reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful - serving more as
plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to
combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved
reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with
dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional
transitions.
  In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a
neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support
property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal
specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation,
we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic
procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and
interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes
closed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its
performance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to
contextualize its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey paper defining time series reasoning as treating time as first-class axis with intermediate evidence integration, categorizing methods by reasoning topology (direct, linear chain, branch-structured) and objectives, with evaluation practices and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To organize and define the emerging field of time series reasoning, which incorporates temporal evidence directly into answers and moves beyond narrow accuracy toward reliable, explainable systems for dynamic world analysis.

Method: Survey methodology organizing literature by reasoning topology (direct, linear chain, branch-structured) crossed with field objectives (traditional analysis, explanation, causal inference, generation), with tag system for decomposition, verification, tool use, and other aspects.

Result: Comprehensive framework for time series reasoning with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources, highlighting evaluation practices that maintain evidence visibility and temporal alignment, and identifying where different topologies succeed or fail in faithfulness/robustness.

Conclusion: Time series reasoning represents a shift toward reliability at scale, requiring balanced structures for grounding/self-correction vs computational cost, with future progress depending on utility-tied benchmarks and closed-loop testbeds for streaming, long-horizon settings.

Abstract: Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates
intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem
and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct
reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and
branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The
topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including
traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal
inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag
set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling,
tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment
regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each
topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along
with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and
deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey).
Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are
highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty,
grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and
treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning
structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against
computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely
depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop
testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and
long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from
narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only
analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable
evidence and credible outcomes.

TL;DR: First comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis self-management reveals significant limitations in spinal radiograph interpretation and AIS care knowledge, with proposed solutions showing partial improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of Multimodal Large Language Models in supporting Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis self-management and identify gaps in their performance for medical applications.

Method: Constructed database of 3,000 X-rays with diagnostic texts; evaluated 5 MLLMs using a 'Divide and Conquer' framework with visual QA, domain knowledge assessment, and patient counseling tasks; enhanced models with spinal keypoint prompting and AIS knowledge base for RAG.

Result: MLLMs showed poor performance in interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge. Spinal keypoint prompting had varying effectiveness across architectures, while RAG substantially improved knowledge assessment performance. Best accuracy for spinal deformity location detection was 0.55 and for direction detection was 0.13.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs are far from capable of serving as personalized assistants in AIS care, with the greatest challenge being accurate detection of spinal deformity locations and directions.

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS)
self-management. We constructed a database of approximately 3,000
anteroposterior X-rays with diagnostic texts and evaluated five MLLMs through a
`Divide and Conquer' framework consisting of a visual question-answering task,
a domain knowledge assessment task, and a patient education counseling
assessment task. Our investigation revealed limitations of MLLMs' ability in
interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge.
To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting
and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG),
respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across
different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances
on the knowledge assessment task. Our findings indicate current MLLMs are far
from capable in realizing personalized assistant in AIS care. The greatest
challenge lies in their abilities to obtain accurate detections of spinal
deformity locations (best accuracy: 0.55) and directions (best accuracy: 0.13).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture the full richness of complex social dynamics, particularly multi-scale interactions and diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents in autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: Constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each agent with aggregation-decomposition message-passing and type-specific feature networks to model both pairwise dependencies and group-wise interactions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Waymo Open Motion Dataset, setting new benchmarks for key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE.

Conclusion: A locality-grounded architecture that explicitly models multi-scale and heterogeneous interactions is highly effective for advancing motion forecasting in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction in autonomous driving requires a
comprehensive understanding of complex social dynamics. Existing methods,
however, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics,
particularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse
behaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling
heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global
context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each
agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and
complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or
pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of
agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme
and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced,
type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a
principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and
expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for
key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a
locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and
heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion
forecasting.

Motivation: To obtain better latent representations of observations that capture action-relevant factors and model the cause-effect relationship between observations and demonstrator actions in video games.

Method: Integrates SupCon loss with continuous output spaces, allowing SupCon to work without constraints on environment action types. Applied to 3D games (Astro Bot, Returnal) and 2D Atari games.

Result: Shows improved representation quality, faster learning convergence, and better generalization compared to baseline models using only supervised action prediction loss functions.

Conclusion: SupCon integration with continuous output spaces effectively enhances imitation learning performance in gaming environments by producing more meaningful state representations.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Supervised Contrastive Learning
(SupCon) to Imitation Learning (IL), with a focus on learning more effective
state representations for agents in video game environments. The goal is to
obtain latent representations of the observations that capture better the
action-relevant factors, thereby modeling better the cause-effect relationship
from the observations that are mapped to the actions performed by the
demonstrator, for example, the player jumps whenever an obstacle appears ahead.
We propose an approach to integrate the SupCon loss with continuous output
spaces, enabling SupCon to operate without constraints regarding the type of
actions of the environment. Experiments on the 3D games Astro Bot and Returnal,
and multiple 2D Atari games show improved representation quality, faster
learning convergence, and better generalization compared to baseline models
trained only with supervised action prediction loss functions.

TL;DR: EgoMem is the first lifelong memory agent for real-time omnimodal models that enables user recognition, personalized responses, and long-term knowledge maintenance from raw audiovisual streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a memory agent that can operate in real-time, lifelong scenarios using raw audiovisual data rather than text-based inputs, addressing the limitations of existing LLM memory agents in embodied and continuous interaction settings.

Method: Three asynchronous processes: retrieval (user identification via face/voice and context gathering), omnimodal dialog (personalized audio response generation), and memory management (dialog boundary detection and information extraction for memory updates).

Result: Retrieval and memory management modules achieve >95% accuracy; integrated system achieves >87% fact-consistency scores in real-time personalized dialogs.

Conclusion: EgoMem establishes a strong baseline for lifelong, real-time memory agents in omnimodal environments, demonstrating high accuracy and effectiveness in personalized interaction scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce EgoMem, the first lifelong memory agent tailored for full-duplex
models that process real-time omnimodal streams. EgoMem enables real-time
models to recognize multiple users directly from raw audiovisual streams, to
provide personalized response, and to maintain long-term knowledge of users'
facts, preferences, and social relationships extracted from audiovisual
history. EgoMem operates with three asynchronous processes: (i) a retrieval
process that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers
relevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that
generates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and
(iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries
from omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the
long-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies
entirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for
lifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
that EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy
on the test set. When integrated with a fine-tuned RoboEgo omnimodal chatbot,
the system achieves fact-consistency scores above 87% in real-time personalized
dialogs, establishing a strong baseline for future research.

Motivation: There is a lack of flexible frameworks to implement reinforcement learning across various building energy management control problems, limiting adoption and research in this domain.

Method: Proposed BuildingGym - an open-source tool that integrates EnergyPlus as core simulator, accepts external control inputs, provides built-in RL algorithms, and allows easy configuration for different control problems.

Result: The framework successfully set up training tasks for cooling load management (both constant and dynamic), with built-in algorithms demonstrating strong performance across both tasks.

Conclusion: BuildingGym effectively bridges the gap between building managers and AI specialists by providing a flexible, research-friendly framework for RL-based building energy management optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for AI-based building energy
management. However, there is a lack of flexible framework to implement RL
across various control problems in building energy management. To address this
gap, we propose BuildingGym, an open-source tool designed as a
research-friendly and flexible framework for training RL control strategies for
common challenges in building energy management. BuildingGym integrates
EnergyPlus as its core simulator, making it suitable for both system-level and
room-level control. Additionally, BuildingGym is able to accept external
signals as control inputs instead of taking the building as a stand-alone
entity. This feature makes BuildingGym applicable for more flexible
environments, e.g. smart grid and EVs community. The tool provides several
built-in RL algorithms for control strategy training, simplifying the process
for building managers to obtain optimal control strategies. Users can achieve
this by following a few straightforward steps to configure BuildingGym for
optimization control for common problems in the building energy management
field. Moreover, AI specialists can easily implement and test state-of-the-art
control algorithms within the platform. BuildingGym bridges the gap between
building managers and AI specialists by allowing for the easy configuration and
replacement of RL algorithms, simulators, and control environments or problems.
With BuildingGym, we efficiently set up training tasks for cooling load
management, targeting both constant and dynamic cooling load management. The
built-in algorithms demonstrated strong performance across both tasks,
highlighting the effectiveness of BuildingGym in optimizing cooling strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unifying theoretical framework that can bridge diverse disciplines (AI, neuroscience, physics, chemistry, materials science) in neuromorphic computing and achieve brain-like efficiency and adaptability in artificial systems.

Method: Proposes dynamical systems theory as the foundational framework, utilizing differential calculus for modeling inference, learning, and control. Employs noise as a learning resource and differential genetic programming to discover adaptive dynamical systems.

Result: The approach enables the development of intelligent systems where behavior emerges from physical substrate dynamics, offering a principled methodology for neuromorphic computing that harnesses noise and enables adaptive behavior discovery.

Conclusion: Dynamical systems theory provides a unifying foundation for neuromorphic computing, paving the way for emergent intelligence from physical substrates and advancing both the science and sustainability of artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency,
flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike
conventional digital approaches, which depend on massive computational and
energy resources, neuromorphic systems exploit brain-inspired principles of
computation to achieve orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. By
drawing on insights from artificial intelligence, neuroscience, physics,
chemistry, and materials science, neuromorphic computing promises to deliver
intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and widely accessible. A
central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying theoretical framework
capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue that dynamical systems
theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in differential calculus, it offers a
principled language for modeling inference, learning, and control in both
natural and artificial substrates. Within this framework, noise can be
harnessed as a resource for learning, while differential genetic programming
enables the discovery of dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors.
Embracing this perspective paves the way toward emergent neuromorphic
intelligence, where intelligent behavior arises from the dynamics of physical
substrates, advancing both the science and sustainability of AI.

Motivation: Traditional metrics like precision/recall fail to account for variability in expert judgments, and Cohen's Kappa lacks interpretability, requiring more robust evaluation methods for medical AI diagnostics.

Method: Introduced Relative Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD/RRAD) that normalize AI performance against inter-expert disagreement, evaluated using 360 medical dialogues comparing LLMs against physician panels with free-form diagnosis approach.

Result: Top models like DeepSeek-V3 achieve consistency on par with or exceeding expert consensus, with 98% accuracy in automated diagnosis identity establishment. Expert judgments show significant variability often greater than AI-human differences.

Conclusion: Supports adopting relative metrics over absolute metrics in medical AI evaluation, demonstrating limitations of traditional approaches and the need for methods that account for inherent expert variability.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostic
workflows requires robust and consistent evaluation methods to ensure
reliability, clinical relevance, and the inherent variability in expert
judgments. Traditional metrics like precision and recall often fail to account
for the inherent variability in expert judgments, leading to inconsistent
assessments of AI performance. Inter-rater agreement statistics like Cohen's
Kappa are more reliable but they lack interpretability. We introduce Relative
Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) - a new
evaluation metrics that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions
rather than a single reference. By normalizing performance against inter-expert
disagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the
quality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of
diagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result.
Our evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a
limited list when evaluating a given case. Instead, both the models being
tested and the examiners verifying them arrive at a free-form diagnosis. In
this automated methodology for establishing the identity of free-form clinical
diagnoses, a remarkable 98% accuracy becomes attainable. We evaluate our
approach using 360 medical dialogues, comparing multiple large language models
(LLMs) against a panel of physicians. Large-scale study shows that
top-performing models, such as DeepSeek-V3, achieve consistency on par with or
exceeding expert consensus. Moreover, we demonstrate that expert judgments
exhibit significant variability - often greater than that between AI and
humans. This finding underscores the limitations of any absolute metrics and
supports the need to adopt relative metrics in medical AI.

*Susanta Mitra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel temporal graph-based reasoning framework for multimodal medical diagnosis that uses backtracking and multi-agent collaboration to improve diagnostic accuracy and track patient health progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning models fall short in healthcare applications, particularly for correct medical diagnosis. There's a need for systems that can handle dynamic changes in reasoning and track patient health over time.

Method: Proposes a temporal graph-based reasoning process using directed graphs with backtracking capabilities. Incorporates multimodal data at different time points and uses a multi-agent framework with task distribution and cross-validation mechanisms.

Result: Preliminary experiments and analysis show the approach has novelty and practical utility for medical reasoning and diagnosis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses multimodal medical reasoning challenges, enabling better diagnostic accuracy and patient health tracking through temporal analysis and collaborative multi-agent validation.

Abstract: Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal
data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal
reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific
domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall
short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of
multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare
professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through
a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in
accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the
reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the
best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at
different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and
disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning
framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to
further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and
analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed
preliminary approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Decentralized swarm of identical foundation models creates coherent musical compositions through stigmergic coordination without weight updates, outperforming centralized systems in quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how coherent long-form creative structures can emerge from decentralized systems without parameter updates, using music composition as a test case for efficient collaborative creation.

Method: A fully decentralized swarm system where bar-wise agents sense and deposit harmonic, rhythmic, and structural cues, adapt short-term memory, and reach consensus through peer-to-peer stigmergic signals.

Result: The swarm yields superior quality with greater diversity and structural variety across symbolic, audio, and graph-theoretic analyses, forming stable complementary roles and small-world network architecture.

Conclusion: MusicSwarm demonstrates that specialization through interaction rules and dynamic consensus provides a compute-efficient route to long-horizon creative structure applicable beyond music to writing, design, and scientific discovery.

Abstract: We show that coherent, long-form musical composition can emerge from a
decentralized swarm of identical, frozen foundation models that coordinate via
stigmergic, peer-to-peer signals, without any weight updates. We compare a
centralized multi-agent system with a global critic to a fully decentralized
swarm in which bar-wise agents sense and deposit harmonic, rhythmic, and
structural cues, adapt short-term memory, and reach consensus. Across symbolic,
audio, and graph-theoretic analyses, the swarm yields superior quality while
delivering greater diversity and structural variety and leads across creativity
metrics. The dynamics contract toward a stable configuration of complementary
roles, and self-similarity networks reveal a small-world architecture with
efficient long-range connectivity and specialized bridging motifs, clarifying
how local novelties consolidate into global musical form. By shifting
specialization from parameter updates to interaction rules, shared memory, and
dynamic consensus, MusicSwarm provides a compute- and data-efficient route to
long-horizon creative structure that is immediately transferable beyond music
to collaborative writing, design, and scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs have implicit reasoning risks where safe unimodal inputs combine to create harmful multimodal outputs. The paper introduces SSUI dataset and SRPO training framework to address this safety alignment issue through reasoning path optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs are vulnerable to implicit reasoning risks where individually safe inputs combine to produce harmful outputs, due to difficulty maintaining safety alignment through long-chain reasoning.

Method: Introduces Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI) dataset with interpretable reasoning paths, and Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO) training framework to align MLLM reasoning with human safety values.

Result: SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on safety benchmarks including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed SSUI dataset and SRPO framework effectively address implicit reasoning risks in MLLMs by optimizing safety alignment through interpretable reasoning paths, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit
reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into
risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this
vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through
long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce
Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring
interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A
novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is
also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning
process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our
SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks,
including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly
outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.

*Hamied Nabizada,Lasse Beers,Alain Chahine,Felix Gehlhoff,Oliver Niggemann,Alexander Fay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A model-driven method for generating symbolic planning artifacts from SysML-based engineering models to enable AI planning validation of system variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBSE models lack symbolic planning semantics (preconditions, effects, constraints) needed to evaluate system variant capabilities and performance efficiency compared to alternatives.

Method: Developed a dedicated SysML profile with reusable stereotypes for planning constructs, integrated into existing models, and an algorithm that automatically generates PDDL domain and problem files while maintaining consistency.

Result: Successfully demonstrated through an aircraft assembly case study where engineering models were enriched with planning semantics and generated consistent planning artifacts for AI planning validation.

Conclusion: The method enables native integration of planning semantics into engineering models and automated generation of planning artifacts, overcoming limitations of manual transformations and external capability models used in previous approaches.

Abstract: Engineering models created in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
environments contain detailed information about system structure and behavior.
However, they typically lack symbolic planning semantics such as preconditions,
effects, and constraints related to resource availability and timing. This
limits their ability to evaluate whether a given system variant can fulfill
specific tasks and how efficiently it performs compared to alternatives.
  To address this gap, this paper presents a model-driven method that enables
the specification and automated generation of symbolic planning artifacts
within SysML-based engineering models. A dedicated SysML profile introduces
reusable stereotypes for core planning constructs. These are integrated into
existing model structures and processed by an algorithm that generates a valid
domain file and a corresponding problem file in Planning Domain Definition
Language (PDDL). In contrast to previous approaches that rely on manual
transformations or external capability models, the method supports native
integration and maintains consistency between engineering and planning
artifacts.
  The applicability of the method is demonstrated through a case study from
aircraft assembly. The example illustrates how existing engineering models are
enriched with planning semantics and how the proposed workflow is applied to
generate consistent planning artifacts from these models. The generated
planning artifacts enable the validation of system variants through AI
planning.

TL;DR: LLMs outperform physicians in complex differential diagnosis and can convincingly emulate expert medical presentations, though image interpretation and literature retrieval remain challenging areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in AI evaluations that focus only on final diagnoses without assessing the comprehensive reasoning and presentation skills required of expert medical discussants.

Method: Created CPC-Bench using 7102 Clinicopathological Conferences and 1021 Image Challenges with physician annotation, then evaluated leading LLMs and developed Dr. CaBot AI discussant for written and video presentations.

Result: OpenAI's o3 ranked first in 60% of cases for final diagnosis and within top ten in 84% of cases, outperforming 20-physician baseline. Physicians misclassified AI vs human differentials in 74% of trials and scored AI more favorably across quality dimensions.

Conclusion: LLMs exceed physician performance on text-based differential diagnosis and can emulate expert presentations effectively, but need improvement in image interpretation and literature retrieval. CPC-Bench and CaBot enable ongoing tracking of medical AI progress.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: For over a century, the New England Journal of Medicine
Clinicopathological Conferences (CPCs) have tested the reasoning of expert
physicians and, recently, artificial intelligence (AI). However, prior AI
evaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted
reasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.
  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),
we conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create
CPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and
multimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models
(LLMs). Then, we developed "Dr. CaBot," an AI discussant designed to produce
written and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,
modeling the role of the human expert in these cases.
  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the
final diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,
outperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached
98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per
unit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image
tasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image
challenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,
physicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of
trials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote
research, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.
  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based
differential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,
but image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and
CaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the process of deriving mathematical functions from data through symbolic regression, particularly extending to multi-view approaches that can describe multiple datasets from the same phenomena to address overfitting and data scarcity issues.

Method: Testing and comparing MvSR implementations in four different tools (Operon, PySR, phy-SO, eggp) across various real-world datasets to evaluate their performance in finding parametric functions that describe multiple datasets.

Result: All four implementations often achieve good accuracy while proposing solutions with only few free parameters, though certain features enable more frequent generation of better models.

Conclusion: Provides guidelines for future MvSR developments based on the comparative analysis, highlighting the importance of specific features for generating better models across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Describing the world behavior through mathematical functions help scientists
to achieve a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of different
phenomena. Traditionally, this is done by deriving new equations from first
principles and careful observations. A modern alternative is to automate part
of this process with symbolic regression (SR). The SR algorithms search for a
function that adequately fits the observed data while trying to enforce
sparsity, in the hopes of generating an interpretable equation. A particularly
interesting extension to these algorithms is the Multi-view Symbolic Regression
(MvSR). It searches for a parametric function capable of describing multiple
datasets generated by the same phenomena, which helps to mitigate the common
problems of overfitting and data scarcity. Recently, multiple implementations
added support to MvSR with small differences between them. In this paper, we
test and compare MvSR as supported in Operon, PySR, phy-SO, and eggp, in
different real-world datasets. We show that they all often achieve good
accuracy while proposing solutions with only few free parameters. However, we
find that certain features enable a more frequent generation of better models.
We conclude by providing guidelines for future MvSR developments.

Conclusion: The framework robustly handles sparse time series data and shows potential generalizability to other domains where zero inflation is a key challenge.

Abstract: Zero-inflated data pose significant challenges in precipitation forecasting
due to the predominance of zeros with sparse non-zero events. To address this,
we propose the Zero Inflation Diffusion Framework (ZIDF), which integrates
Gaussian perturbation for smoothing zero-inflated distributions,
Transformer-based prediction for capturing temporal patterns, and
diffusion-based denoising to restore the original data structure. In our

that ZIDF demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple

TL;DR: FEDEXCHANGE is a federated object detection framework that improves cross-domain generalization through server-side model exchange without adding local computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FOD methods struggle with domain variations and impose high computational costs on edge devices, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Uses server-side dynamic model exchange strategy with alternating aggregation and exchange rounds, clustering models based on distance measures to enable cross-domain learning.

Result: Achieves 1.6X better mean average precision in challenging domains (e.g., rainy conditions) while requiring only 0.8X computational resources compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FEDEXCHANGE effectively bridges domain gaps in federated object detection without additional client-side computational burden, making it suitable for edge device deployment.

Abstract: Federated Object Detection (FOD) enables clients to collaboratively train a
global object detection model without accessing their local data from diverse
domains. However, significant variations in environment, weather, and other
domain specific factors hinder performance, making cross domain generalization
a key challenge. Existing FOD methods often overlook the hardware constraints
of edge devices and introduce local training regularizations that incur high
computational costs, limiting real-world applicability. In this paper, we
propose FEDEXCHANGE, a novel FOD framework that bridges domain gaps without
introducing additional local computational overhead. FEDEXCHANGE employs a
server side dynamic model exchange strategy that enables each client to gain
insights from other clients' domain data without direct data sharing.
Specifically, FEDEXCHANGE allows the server to alternate between model
aggregation and model exchange. During aggregation rounds, the server
aggregates all local models as usual. In exchange rounds, FEDEXCHANGE clusters
and exchanges local models based on distance measures, allowing local models to
learn from a variety of domains. As all operations are performed on the server
side, clients can achieve improved cross domain utility without any additional
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FEDEXCHANGE
enhances FOD performance, achieving 1.6X better mean average precision in
challenging domains, such as rainy conditions, while requiring only 0.8X the
computational resources compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: InterRetro reframes retrosynthesis as worst-path optimization in tree MDPs, achieving 100% success on Retro*-190 benchmark with shorter routes and better data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrosynthesis methods optimize average performance but fail to address the 'weakest link' problem where any invalid leaf node makes the entire synthesis tree invalid.

Method: Formulates retrosynthesis as worst-path optimization in tree-structured MDPs, introduces InterRetro that learns value functions for worst-path outcomes and improves policy through self-imitation with high-advantage decision reinforcement.

Result: Achieves 100% success on Retro*-190 benchmark, shortens synthetic routes by 4.9%, and shows promising performance with only 10% of training data.

Conclusion: Represents a significant advance in computational retrosynthesis planning by addressing the critical worst-case sensitivity problem through novel MDP formulation and self-imitation learning.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning aims to decompose target molecules into available
building blocks, forming a synthesis tree where each internal node represents
an intermediate compound and each leaf ideally corresponds to a purchasable
reactant. However, this tree becomes invalid if any leaf node is not a valid
building block, making the planning process vulnerable to the "weakest link" in
the synthetic route. Existing methods often optimise for average performance
across branches, failing to account for this worst-case sensitivity. In this
paper, we reframe retrosynthesis as a worst-path optimisation problem within
tree-structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that this
formulation admits a unique optimal solution and offers monotonic improvement
guarantees. Building on this insight, we introduce Interactive Retrosynthesis
Planning (InterRetro), a method that interacts with the tree MDP, learns a
value function for worst-path outcomes, and improves its policy through
self-imitation, preferentially reinforcing past decisions with high estimated

100% of targets on the Retro*-190 benchmark, shortening synthetic routes by
4.9%, and achieving promising performance using only 10% of the training data -
representing a significant advance in computational retrosynthesis planning.

TL;DR: AttnBoost integrates feature-level attention into gradient boosting to improve retail demand forecasting accuracy and interpretability by dynamically adjusting feature importance during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional gradient boosting models lack adaptive mechanisms to identify and emphasize the most relevant features under rapidly changing retail conditions with noisy, heterogeneous data.

Method: Proposes AttnBoost framework that integrates a lightweight attention mechanism into the boosting process to dynamically adjust feature importance during each boosting round, focusing on high-impact variables like promotions, pricing, and seasonal trends.

Result: Outperforms standard machine learning and deep tabular models on large-scale retail sales dataset, with ablation study confirming the attention module's utility in mitigating overfitting and improving interpretability.

Conclusion: Attention-guided boosting represents a promising direction for interpretable and scalable AI in real-world forecasting applications, providing both predictive accuracy and actionable insights for supply chain managers.

Abstract: Forecasting product demand in retail supply chains presents a complex
challenge due to noisy, heterogeneous features and rapidly shifting consumer
behavior. While traditional gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) offer
strong predictive performance on structured data, they often lack adaptive
mechanisms to identify and emphasize the most relevant features under changing
conditions. In this work, we propose AttnBoost, an interpretable learning
framework that integrates feature-level attention into the boosting process to
enhance both predictive accuracy and explainability. Specifically, the model
dynamically adjusts feature importance during each boosting round via a
lightweight attention mechanism, allowing it to focus on high-impact variables
such as promotions, pricing, and seasonal trends. We evaluate AttnBoost on a
large-scale retail sales dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms standard
machine learning and deep tabular models, while also providing actionable
insights for supply chain managers. An ablation study confirms the utility of
the attention module in mitigating overfitting and improving interpretability.
Our results suggest that attention-guided boosting represents a promising
direction for interpretable and scalable AI in real-world forecasting
applications.

*Sai Teja Reddy Adapala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selective feedback mechanism reverses model collapse in LLMs, inducing performance improvement instead of degradation - called the Anti-Ouroboros Effect


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the foundational problem of AI safety regarding the stability of recursively trained large language models, challenging prevailing theories that predict model collapse when models are trained on their own output

Method: Introduced a selective feedback mechanism and conducted experiments comparing quality-filtered conditions vs unfiltered and random-filter controls across five generations using a Gemma 2B model on complex summarization tasks

Result: Quality-filtered condition improved by 6.6% in ROUGE-L F1 score, while unfiltered control degraded by 3.5% and random-filter control degraded by 4.2%. Found strong evidence that selection pressure reverses model degradation

Conclusion: Systemic resilience can be an emergent property of LLMs under simple selection pressure, suggesting a powerful and scalable principle for developing safer and more robust AI systems

Abstract: The stability of recursively trained large language models (LLMs) is a
foundational problem for AI safety. Prevailing theory predicts model collapse,
a progressive degradation when models are trained on their own output. We
challenge this narrative by introducing a selective feedback mechanism.
Contrary to expectation, instead of merely slowing decay, our experiments
provide strong evidence that this pressure reverses it, inducing a
statistically significant performance improvement in a Gemma 2B model on a
complex summarization task. We name this phenomenon the Anti-Ouroboros Effect.
We contrast this with a foundational experiment using a simple classifier,
where the theoretical degenerative loop was validated, highlighting the unique
dynamics of high-dimensional models. Our findings establish that systemic
resilience can be an emergent property of LLMs under simple selection pressure,
suggesting a powerful and scalable principle for developing safer and more
robust AI systems. Across five generations, a quality-filtered condition
improved by 6.6% in ROUGE-L F1 score, whereas an unfiltered control degraded by
3.5% and a random-filter control degraded by 4.2%

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogGuardQ is a novel RL framework with cognitive-inspired dual-memory and adaptive exploration that significantly outperforms DQN and PPO in anomaly detection tasks, achieving 96% detection rate with superior stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL algorithms like DQN and PPO struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and adaptability in dynamic environments, particularly for anomaly detection tasks.

Method: Integrates dual-memory system inspired by human cognition with adaptive exploration strategies using temperature decay and curiosity mechanisms. Evaluated on 1M simulated access logs with 47.9% anomalies over 20,000 episodes.

Result: Achieves 96.0% detection rate (vs 93.0% DQN, 47.1% PPO), precision 0.4776, recall 0.9996, F1-score 0.6450. Mean reward 20.34 ± 44.63. Statistical tests confirm significant advantages with p < 0.0001 vs PPO.

Conclusion: LogGuardQ bridges cognitive science and RL, offering scalable adaptive learning for cybersecurity, intrusion detection, and decision-making under uncertainty with superior performance and stability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision-making, but
traditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and
adaptability in dynamic environments. This study presents LogGuardQ (Adaptive
Log Guard with Cognitive enhancement), a novel framework that integrates a
dual-memory system inspired by human cognition and adaptive exploration
strategies driven by temperature decay and curiosity. Evaluated on a dataset of
1,000,000 simulated access logs with 47.9% anomalies over 20,000 episodes,
LogGuardQ achieves a 96.0% detection rate (versus 93.0% for DQN and 47.1% for
PPO), with precision of 0.4776, recall of 0.9996, and an F1-score of 0.6450.
The mean reward is 20.34 \pm 44.63 across all episodes (versus 18.80 \pm 43.98
for DQN and -0.17 \pm 23.79 for PPO), with an average of 5.0 steps per episode
(constant across models). Graphical analyses, including learning curves
smoothed with a Savgol filter (window=501, polynomial=2), variance trends,
action distributions, and cumulative detections, demonstrate LogGuardQ's
superior stability and efficiency. Statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U) confirm
significant performance advantages (e.g., p = 0.0002 vs. DQN with negligible
effect size, p < 0.0001 vs. PPO with medium effect size, and p < 0.0001 for DQN
vs. PPO with small effect size). By bridging cognitive science and RL,
LogGuardQ offers a scalable approach to adaptive learning in uncertain
environments, with potential applications in cybersecurity, intrusion
detection, and decision-making under uncertainty.

### [61] [A Service-Oriented Adaptive Hierarchical Incentive Mechanism for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10512)
*Jiaxing Cao,Yuzhou Gao,Jiwei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive incentive mechanism for federated learning using Stackelberg game and multi-agent reinforcement learning to maximize utilities of task publisher, local model owners, and workers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning suffers from lack of training data, requiring recruitment of workers for data gathering. Need incentive mechanisms to maximize utilities of all participants.

Method: Establishes Stackelberg game between LMOs and TP with analytical Nash equilibrium. Formulates LMO-worker interaction as multi-agent MDP solved with deep reinforcement learning. Designs ASOSA algorithm for strategy stabilization.

Result: Extensive numerical experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed method in maximizing participant utilities.

Conclusion: The adaptive incentive mechanism effectively addresses data scarcity in FL while optimizing utilities for all stakeholders through game theory and reinforcement learning approaches.

Abstract: Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a novel framework for
distributed model training. In FL, the task publisher (TP) releases tasks, and
local model owners (LMOs) use their local data to train models. Sometimes, FL
suffers from the lack of training data, and thus workers are recruited for
gathering data. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive incentive
mechanism from a service-oriented perspective, with the objective of maximizing
the utilities of TP, LMOs and workers. Specifically, a Stackelberg game is
theoretically established between the LMOs and TP, positioning TP as the leader
and the LMOs as followers. An analytical Nash equilibrium solution is derived
to maximize their utilities. The interaction between LMOs and workers is
formulated by a multi-agent Markov decision process (MAMDP), with the optimal
strategy identified via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Additionally, an
Adaptively Searching the Optimal Strategy Algorithm (ASOSA) is designed to
stabilize the strategies of each participant and solve the coupling problems.
Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the
proposed method.

TL;DR: MoCE introduces a dual-stage routing mechanism with expert group routing at sequence level and token-level expert activation within groups, improving specialization and generalization for heterogeneous inputs in instruction tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of improving expert specialization in sparse Mixture-of-Experts architectures, particularly for instruction tuning scenarios with significant input heterogeneity where traditional MoE struggles to effectively partition knowledge requirements.

Method: Proposes Mixture-of-Clustered-Experts (MoCE) with dual-stage routing: 1) First stage performs expert group routing based on sequence-level features, 2) Second stage activates top-k experts within the selected group at token level, enabling effective partitioning of heterogeneous inputs.

Result: Demonstrates consistent superiority over strong baselines across comprehensive benchmarks, showing enhanced generalization capabilities, robustness, and effectiveness in handling heterogeneous input scenarios.

Conclusion: MoCE successfully addresses MoE limitations by enabling expert group specialization while maintaining token-level routing advantages, providing an effective solution for instruction tuning with heterogeneous inputs through its dual-stage routing mechanism.

Abstract: A sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a highly
scalable solution by conditionally activating sub-modules without a
proportional increase in computational costs. However, improving expert
specialization to enhance performance and generalization remains a challenge
for MoE, especially in instruction tuning scenarios characterized by
significant input heterogeneity. In this work, we propose the
Mixture-of-Clustered-Experts (MoCE) to address this limitation through a
dual-stage routing mechanism. The first stage in the mechanism performs expert
group routing based on sequence-level features, while the second stage
activates the top-$k$ experts within the group at the token level. This
approach enables the effective partitioning of heterogeneous inputs based on
their knowledge requirements, encouraging expert group specialization while
maintaining the advantages of token-level routing. We evaluate MoCE across a
comprehensive set of benchmarks, demonstrating its consistent superiority over
strong baselines and its enhanced generalization capabilities. Detailed
analysis further highlights the robustness and effectiveness of MoCE.

Motivation: Existing research lacks a unified framework to analyze continuous attractor properties across diverse dynamical systems, limiting cross-architectural generalizability.

Method: Establishes a novel framework from the perspective of differential manifolds to investigate continuous attractors in artificial neural networks.

Result: Verifies compatibility with prior conclusions, elucidates links between continuous attractor phenomena and eigenvalues of the local Jacobian matrix, and demonstrates universality of singular value stratification.

Abstract: Continuous attractors are critical for information processing in both

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UAPO is a new offline preference optimization framework that uses utility anchors to handle preference data uncertainties, enabling training with unpaired data and improving robustness compared to traditional DPO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DPO methods rely on Bradley-Terry reward modeling which has strict assumptions like requiring pairwise training data, model distribution shifting, and human rationality assumptions. These limitations restrict data utilization and robustness.

Method: Proposed Adaptive Preference Optimization with Utility Anchor (UAPO) framework that introduces an anchoring function to estimate uncertainties from preference data annotation. This allows training with unpaired data and enhances robustness.

Result: Experimental results show UAPO achieves competitive outcomes without strict dependency on data pairing, significantly improving data utilization efficiency.

Conclusion: UAPO provides a more flexible and effective approach for preference optimization, paving the way for methods that don't require strict data pairing assumptions.

Abstract: Offline preference optimization methods are efficient for large language
models (LLMs) alignment. Direct Preference optimization (DPO)-like learning,
one of the most popular approaches, stands out for its efficiency in reward
modeling. However, these methods typically follow the convention to use
Bradley-Terry (BT) reward modeling that faces several critical assumptions,
including the requirement for pairwise training data, model distribution
shifting, human rationality assumption, etc. To address these limitations, we
propose a general framework for offline preference optimization methods,
Adaptive Preference Optimization with Utility Anchor (UAPO), which introduces
an anchoring function to estimate the uncertainties brought from preference
data annotation. Our method enables training even in scenarios where the data
is unpaired, significantly enhancing data utilization efficiency. Moreover, the
anchor design makes UAPO more robust in the training process. Experimental
results demonstrate that UAPO achieves competitive outcomes without the strict
dependency on data pairing, paving the way for more flexible and effective
preference optimization methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the conflict between data-driven personalization in education and student data privacy challenges under modern data protection regulations.

Method: Proposed a novel recommender system using Federated Learning (FL) with Deep Neural Network (DNN) on the ASSISTments educational dataset, comparing federated aggregation strategies including FedProx vs FedAvg.

Result: FedProx was significantly more stable and effective for heterogeneous student data. The optimized federated model achieved 76.28% F1-Score, representing 82.85% of centralized XGBoost model performance.

Conclusion: Federated Learning provides an effective solution to the personalization-privacy dilemma in educational platforms, enabling content recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data.

Abstract: The increasing digitalization of education presents unprecedented
opportunities for data-driven personalization, yet it introduces significant
student data privacy challenges. Conventional recommender systems rely on
centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection
regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and
evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The
approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features
from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative
analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx
as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous
student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model
achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28\%, corresponding to 82.85\% of
the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings
validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content
recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our
work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy
dilemma in modern educational platforms.

TL;DR: FedProx outperforms other federated learning methods for mortality prediction on non-IID clinical data with class imbalance, achieving highest F1-score of 0.8831.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning for mortality prediction faces privacy constraints and statistical heterogeneity in clinical data. Federated learning offers privacy but needs evaluation under non-IID and imbalanced conditions.

Method: Comparative benchmark of 5 FL strategies (FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdagrad, FedAdam, FedCluster) using MIMIC-IV dataset partitioned by clinical care unit to simulate non-IID environment. Applied SMOTE-Tomek for class imbalance, conducted over 50 communication rounds.

Result: FedProx consistently outperformed other methods with highest F1-Score of 0.8831 and stable convergence. FedAvg was most computationally efficient but had substantially lower predictive performance.

Conclusion: Regularization-based FL algorithms like FedProx provide more robust and effective solution for heterogeneous and imbalanced clinical prediction tasks than standard or server-side adaptive methods.

Abstract: Machine learning models hold significant potential for predicting in-hospital
mortality, yet data privacy constraints and the statistical heterogeneity of
real-world clinical data often hamper their development. Federated Learning
(FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but its performance under
non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) and imbalanced conditions
requires rigorous investigation. The study presents a comparative benchmark of
five federated learning strategies: FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdagrad, FedAdam, and
FedCluster for mortality prediction. Using the large-scale MIMIC-IV dataset, we
simulate a realistic non-IID environment by partitioning data by clinical care
unit. To address the inherent class imbalance of the task, the SMOTE-Tomek
technique is applied to each client's local training data. Our experiments,
conducted over 50 communication rounds, reveal that the regularization-based
strategy, FedProx, consistently outperformed other methods, achieving the
highest F1-Score of 0.8831 while maintaining stable convergence. While the
baseline FedAvg was the most computationally efficient, its predictive
performance was substantially lower. Our findings indicate that
regularization-based FL algorithms like FedProx offer a more robust and
effective solution for heterogeneous and imbalanced clinical prediction tasks
than standard or server-side adaptive aggregation methods. The work provides a
crucial empirical benchmark for selecting appropriate FL strategies for
real-world healthcare applications.

Motivation: To solve catastrophic forgetting in AI systems while maintaining efficiency and minimal memory footprint, enabling continuous learning without retraining.

Method: Four-phase pipeline using fractal quantization, probabilistic entanglement, and dynamic diffraction chipping to compress and holographically integrate knowledge substrates.

Result: 0% forgetting (infinite improvement over baselines), 3x compression, 67% storage savings, 53% training time reduction, and projected $92.4M savings over 5 years at petabyte scale.

Conclusion: HKM enables paradigm shift for LLMs with 'eternal' adaptation, potentially reducing fine-tuning costs by 60-80% and democratizing scalable AI with future quantum hardware extensions.

Abstract: We introduce the Holographic Knowledge Manifold (HKM), a four-phase pipeline
that achieves zero catastrophic forgetting in AI knowledge representation while
maintaining minimal memory growth and high efficiency. Leveraging fractal
quantization, probabilistic entanglement, and dynamic diffraction chipping, HKM
compresses knowledge substrates by 3x with 67% storage savings, integrates
holographically at 100%, and supports over 1,020 updates with 1% growth per

2,997 nodes), we demonstrate industry-leading performance: 0% forgetting
(infinite improvement over GEM baselines), 3x compression, and 53% training
time reduction on consumer GPU hardware. Hypothetical cost analyses project
$92.4M savings over 5 years at petabyte scale, with 21.2% energy reduction and
33% lower carbon footprint. This work hypothesizes a paradigm shift for public
large language models (LLMs), enabling "eternal" adaptation without retraining.
Future extensions to multimodal fusion and quantum hardware could further
democratize scalable AI, potentially reducing fine-tuning costs by 60-80% for

TL;DR: Proposes two lookup table methods (LUT-2D and LUT-1D) for more precise gradient estimation in approximate multiplier retraining, significantly improving deep learning model accuracy recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches estimate gradients of approximate multipliers using accurate multiplier gradients, leading to suboptimal retraining results and accuracy recovery in deep learning models.

Method: Two gradient estimation methods: LUT-2D uses 2D lookup tables for fine-grained gradient characterization, while LUT-1D uses more efficient 1D lookup tables for comparable accuracy with shorter runtime.

Result: On CIFAR-10 with CNNs: LUT-2D improves accuracy by 3.83%, LUT-1D by 3.72% on average. On ImageNet with vision transformers: LUT-1D improves accuracy by 23.69% compared to state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The proposed LUT-based gradient estimation methods provide more precise gradients for approximate multiplier retraining, significantly outperforming existing approaches in accuracy recovery for deep learning models.

Abstract: Approximate multipliers (AppMults) are widely used in deep learning
accelerators to reduce their area, delay, and power consumption. However,
AppMults introduce arithmetic errors into deep learning models, necessitating a
retraining process to recover accuracy. A key step in retraining is computing
the gradient of the AppMult, i.e., the partial derivative of the approximate
product with respect to each input operand. Existing approaches typically
estimate this gradient using that of the accurate multiplier (AccMult), which
can lead to suboptimal retraining results. To address this, we propose two
methods to obtain more precise gradients of AppMults. The first, called LUT-2D,
characterizes the AppMult gradient with 2-dimensional lookup tables (LUTs),
providing fine-grained estimation and achieving the highest retraining
accuracy. The second, called LUT-1D, is a compact and more efficient variant
that stores gradient values in 1-dimensional LUTs, achieving comparable
retraining accuracy with shorter runtime. Experimental results show that on
CIFAR-10 with convolutional neural networks, our LUT-2D and LUT-1D methods
improve retraining accuracy by 3.83% and 3.72% on average, respectively. On
ImageNet with vision transformer models, our LUT-1D method improves retraining
accuracy by 23.69% on average, compared to a state-of-the-art retraining
framework.

TL;DR: Counterfactual Sample Identification reframes contextual bandit problems by learning to identify which action led to success through counterfactual comparison instead of direct reward prediction, overcoming confounding issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct reward models in contextual bandits suffer from confounding effects where it's difficult to isolate the action's effect from the context's influence, limiting their effectiveness in production systems.

Method: Learns to recognize which action led to a successful binary outcome by comparing it to a counterfactual action sampled from the logging policy under the same context, rather than predicting reward directly.

Result: The method consistently outperforms direct models in both synthetic experiments and real-world deployments, demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: Counterfactual Sample Identification provides a theoretically grounded approach that effectively addresses confounding issues in contextual bandit systems and delivers superior performance compared to traditional direct reward modeling.

Abstract: In production systems, contextual bandit approaches often rely on direct
reward models that take both action and context as input. However, these models
can suffer from confounding, making it difficult to isolate the effect of the
action from that of the context. We present \emph{Counterfactual Sample
Identification}, a new approach that re-frames the problem: rather than
predicting reward, it learns to recognize which action led to a successful
(binary) outcome by comparing it to a counterfactual action sampled from the
logging policy under the same context. The method is theoretically grounded and
consistently outperforms direct models in both synthetic experiments and
real-world deployments.

*Sai Puppala,Ismail Hossain,Md Jahangir Alam,Sajedul Talukder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VGM^2 is a personalized federated learning framework that uses variational Gaussian mixture manifolds to model client-specific geometry, addressing label skew and non-stationarity by exchanging only compact geometry summaries instead of full model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized federated learning often fails under label skew and non-stationarity because a single global parameterization ignores client-specific geometry, leading to poor performance in heterogeneous environments.

Method: Learns client-specific parametric UMAP embeddings, models latent pairwise distances with mixture relation markers for same/different class pairs, and exchanges only variational uncertainty-aware marker statistics using Dirichlet-Normal-Inverse-Gamma posteriors that are aggregated via conjugate moment matching.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior test F1 scores across eight vision datasets with non-IID label shards while communicating only small geometry summaries, with strengthened privacy through secure aggregation and optional differential privacy.

Conclusion: VGM^2 provides an effective geometry-centric approach to personalized federated learning that maintains performance under heterogeneity while significantly reducing communication overhead and enhancing privacy protections.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) often fails under label skew and
non-stationarity because a single global parameterization ignores
client-specific geometry. We introduce VGM$^2$ (Variational Gaussian Mixture
Manifold), a geometry-centric PFL framework that (i) learns client-specific
parametric UMAP embeddings, (ii) models latent pairwise distances with mixture
relation markers for same and different class pairs, and (iii) exchanges only
variational, uncertainty-aware marker statistics. Each client maintains a
Dirichlet-Normal-Inverse-Gamma (Dir-NIG) posterior over marker weights, means,
and variances; the server aggregates via conjugate moment matching to form
global priors that guide subsequent rounds. We prove that this aggregation
minimizes the summed reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence from client posteriors
within the conjugate family, yielding stability under heterogeneity. We further
incorporate a calibration term for distance-to-similarity mapping and report
communication and compute budgets. Across eight vision datasets with non-IID
label shards, VGM$^2$ achieves competitive or superior test F1 scores compared
to strong baselines while communicating only small geometry summaries. Privacy
is strengthened through secure aggregation and optional differential privacy
noise, and we provide a membership-inference stress test. Code and
configurations will be released to ensure full reproducibility.

TL;DR: A two-module framework combining deep learning with explainable AI for autism diagnosis, using transfer learning to overcome data scarcity and XAI techniques to interpret model decisions and identify critical brain regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited use of transfer learning in ASD research and overcome data scarcity issues in autism spectrum disorder diagnosis through machine learning approaches.

Method: Two-module framework: 1) Deep learning model fine-tuned via cross-domain transfer learning for ASD classification, 2) Three XAI techniques (saliency mapping, Grad-CAM, and SHAP analysis) to interpret decisions and identify critical brain regions.

Result: Cross-domain transfer learning effectively addresses data scarcity in ASD research. XAI techniques successfully reveal model decision-making processes and identify brain regions most associated with ASD, with strong alignment to established neurobiological evidence.

characterized by atypical brain maturation. However, the adaptation of transfer
learning paradigms in machine learning for ASD research remains notably
limited. In this study, we propose a computer-aided diagnostic framework with
two modules. This chapter presents a two-module framework combining deep
learning and explainable AI for ASD diagnosis. The first module leverages a
deep learning model fine-tuned through cross-domain transfer learning for ASD
classification. The second module focuses on interpreting the model decisions
and identifying critical brain regions. To achieve this, we employed three
explainable AI (XAI) techniques: saliency mapping, Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. This
framework demonstrates that cross-domain transfer learning can effectively
address data scarcity in ASD research. In addition, by applying three
established explainability techniques, the approach reveals how the model makes
diagnostic decisions and identifies brain regions most associated with ASD.
These findings were compared against established neurobiological evidence,
highlighting strong alignment and reinforcing the clinical relevance of the
proposed approach.

*Dieter Balemans,Thomas Huybrechts,Jan Steckel,Siegfried Mercelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel neural network pruning method using graph-based AutoML framework with GAT encoder and binary action space, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pruning methods rely on hand-crafted heuristics and local optimization, leading to suboptimal performance and inefficient strategies that lack global network understanding.

Method: Transforms pruning into graph representation using GAT encoder for global topological relationships, implements binary action space instead of continuous ratios, and uses CMDP framework with self-competition reward system under resource constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show consistent outperformance over traditional pruning techniques with state-of-the-art results and task-specific pruning strategies.

Conclusion: The graph-based AutoML framework successfully addresses limitations of existing pruning methods by providing global network understanding and learning optimal pruning criteria directly from data, identifying functionally redundant connections beyond simple weight magnitude.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural network pruning by integrating
a graph-based observation space into an AutoML framework to address the
limitations of existing methods. Traditional pruning approaches often depend on
hand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to
suboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework
transforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the
target neural network that captures complete topological relationships between
layers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a
global view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph
Attention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph
representation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action
space we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary
action spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance
criteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions.
These contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process
(CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while
adhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates. For this, we
design a self-competition reward system that encourages the agent to outperform
its previous best performance while satisfying the defined constraints. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The experiments
show that our method consistently outperforms traditional pruning techniques,
showing state-of-the-art results while learning task-specific pruning
strategies that identify functionally redundant connections beyond simple
weight magnitude considerations.

*Aoi Otani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Replay enables efficient continual learning for text-to-image diffusion models by storing compact feature representations instead of raw images, reducing catastrophic forgetting and mode collapse while maintaining 77.59% performance on earliest concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting and mode collapse in text-to-image diffusion models during continual learning, inspired by how human brain stores neural activity patterns rather than raw sensory inputs.

Method: Apply Latent Replay approach - store compact high-level feature representations from model's internal architecture instead of full images, using random selection strategy for stored latent examples.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods with 77.59% Image Alignment on earliest concept (14% higher than baselines), maintains diverse outputs, and random selection strategy works better than similarity-based approaches.

Conclusion: Latent Replay enables efficient continual learning for generative AI models, paving way for personalized text-to-image models that can evolve with user needs without excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Continual learning -- the ability to acquire knowledge incrementally without
forgetting previous skills -- is fundamental to natural intelligence. While the
human brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with
"catastrophic forgetting," where learning new tasks erases previously acquired
knowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion
models, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models
face "mode collapse," where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over
time. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a
neuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods
mitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically
requiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only
compact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal
architecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity
patterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving
critical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual
concepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing
methods in maintaining model versatility. After learning all concepts, our
approach retained 77.59% Image Alignment (IA) on the earliest concept, 14%
higher than baseline methods, while maintaining diverse outputs. Surprisingly,
random selection of stored latent examples outperforms similarity-based
strategies. Our findings suggest that Latent Replay enables efficient continual
learning for generative AI models, paving the way for personalized
text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive
computational costs.

*Cheng Li,Jiexiong Liu,Yixuan Chen,Jie ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DASG-MoE model combines grouped multi-head attention, dual-scale shared experts, and adaptive routing to improve long-sequence modeling efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE transformer models have limitations in computational efficiency and long-range dependency capture, particularly in dynamic expert resource allocation for long sequences.

Method: Three key modules: 1) Grouped Multi-Head Attention for reduced complexity via parallel processing, 2) Dual-Scale Shared Expert structure with shallow experts for low-dim features and deep experts for complex semantics, 3) hierarchical Adaptive Dynamic Routing for expert selection based on feature complexity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple long-sequence benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DASG-MoE model effectively addresses computational efficiency and long-range dependency challenges in long-sequence modeling through its integrated architecture.

Abstract: Transformer models based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture have
made significant progress in long-sequence modeling, but existing models still
have shortcomings in computational efficiency and the ability to capture
long-range dependencies, especially in terms of the dynamic adaptability of
expert resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive Shared
Expert and Grouped Multi-Head Attention Hybrid Model (DASG-MoE) to enhance
long-sequence modeling capabilities by integrating three modules. First, we
employ the Grouped Multi-Head Attention (GMHA) mechanism to effectively reduce
the computational complexity of long sequences. By parallel processing through
sequence grouping, local sliding window attention, and feature aggregation, we
address long-range dependency issues and the model's lack of generalization for
local information. Second, we design a Dual-Scale Shared Expert Structure
(DSSE), where shallow experts use lightweight computations to quickly respond
to low-dimensional features, while deep experts process high-dimensional
complex semantics through pre-training transfer and post-training optimization,
achieving a dynamic balance between efficiency and accuracy. Third, we propose
a hierarchical Adaptive Dynamic Routing (ADR) mechanism that dynamically
selects expert levels based on feature complexity and task requirements, and
optimizes resource allocation through a local expert activation strategy.
Experiments on multiple long-sequence benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
DASG-MoE model outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRL-based portfolio optimization method that combines exploitation of existing assets with exploration of new investment opportunities using two agents for dynamic market adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most DRL portfolio methods are limited to pre-defined asset universes and miss new opportunities. This study addresses the need to balance exploiting known assets with exploring new investments in evolving markets.

Method: Uses two DRL agents - one for asset allocation within existing universe, another for exploring new opportunities in extended universe. Dynamically balances exploitation and exploration objectives.

Result: Tested on two real-world market datasets, the approach outperforms state-of-the-art portfolio strategies and baseline methods, demonstrating superior portfolio performance.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-agent DRL framework effectively integrates exploitation and exploration, enhancing portfolio optimization by adapting to market changes while discovering new investment opportunities.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is essential for balancing risk and return in
financial decision-making. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has stood out as a
cutting-edge tool for portfolio optimization that learns dynamic asset
allocation using trial-and-error interactions. However, most DRL-based methods
are restricted to allocating assets within a pre-defined investment universe
and overlook exploring new opportunities. This study introduces an investment
landscape that integrates exploiting existing assets with exploring new
investment opportunities in an extended universe. The proposed approach
leverages two DRL agents and dynamically balances these objectives to adapt to
evolving markets while enhancing portfolio performance. One agent allocates
assets within the existing universe, while another assists in exploring new
opportunities in the extended universe. The effciency of the proposed
methodology is determined using two real-world market data sets. The
experiments demonstrate the superiority of the suggested approach against the
state-of-the-art portfolio strategies and baseline methods.

*Anand Gopalakrishnan,Robert Csordás,Jürgen Schmidhuber,Michael C. Mozer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PoPE improves RoPE by separating content and position information, enhancing performance on tasks requiring independent matching and enabling better length extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE entangles content and position information, which can impair performance when decisions require independent matching on these factors.

Method: Proposed Polar Coordinate Position Embeddings (PoPE) that eliminates the what-where confound by separating content and position information.

Result: PoPE outperforms RoPE on diagnostic tasks, autoregressive sequence modeling in music, genomic, and natural language domains, with better perplexity and downstream task performance. Shows strong zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities.

Conclusion: PoPE provides superior positional encoding by disentangling content and position information, enabling better performance and length generalization without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: The attention mechanism in a Transformer architecture matches key to query
based on both content -- the what -- and position in a sequence -- the where.
We present an analysis indicating that what and where are entangled in the
popular RoPE rotary position embedding. This entanglement can impair
performance particularly when decisions require independent matches on these
two factors. We propose an improvement to RoPE, which we call Polar Coordinate
Position Embeddings or PoPE, that eliminates the what-where confound. PoPE is
far superior on a diagnostic task requiring indexing solely by position or by
content. On autoregressive sequence modeling in music, genomic, and natural
language domains, Transformers using PoPE as the positional encoding scheme
outperform baselines using RoPE with respect to evaluation loss (perplexity)
and downstream task performance. On language modeling, these gains persist
across model scale, from 124M to 774M parameters. Crucially, PoPE shows strong
zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities, whereas RoPE's performance
degrades significantly on longer sequences at test time without fine tuning or
the use of position-interpolation methods.

TL;DR: SG-LoRA is a zero-shot framework that generates user-specific LoRA parameters using semantic task descriptions, enabling personalized model adaptation without retraining or accessing user data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of unified models for edge users with task-specific preferences, domain shifts, and privacy concerns about retraining with user data.

Method: Uses task descriptions as semantic bridges to measure proximity to expert tasks in embedding space, then models target task's LoRA parameter distribution to generate parameters for novel tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance and remarkable adaptability across multiple challenging tasks.

Conclusion: SG-LoRA provides an efficient, privacy-preserving solution for personalized model adaptation in zero-shot open-world settings.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated strong generalization
capabilities across a variety of tasks for efficiently fine-tuning AI models,
especially on resource-constrained edges. However, in real-world applications,
edge users often exhibit task-specific preferences that are difficult to handle
with a unified model trained under a closed-world assumption, and the challenge
may further increase when there are significant domain shifts between training
and deployment. Meanwhile, retraining/fine-tuning models for each user is also
impractical due to its cost-intensive nature and privacy concerns over raw data
utilization from edges. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-guided
LoRA Parameter Generation (SG-LoRA), the first of its kind framework to
efficiently produce user-specific LoRA parameters without any additional
training on user tasks or access to user-specific data. Concretely, SG-LoRA
uses task descriptions as the semantic bridge, measuring their proximity to a
set of known expert tasks in a shared embedding space. Based on this semantic
guidance, it models the target task's LoRA parameter distribution to generate
high-performing parameters for novel tasks. SG-LoRA enables the real-time
construction of LoRA models aligned with individual intents by distilling
knowledge from prominent LoRA experts and, meanwhile, offering a
privacy-preserving solution for personalized model adaptation in a novel
zero-shot open-world setting proposed in this work. Extensive experiments on
multiple challenging tasks confirm the superior performance and remarkable
adaptability of SG-LoRA. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Geometric extension of RBMs using group-valued weights (e.g., GL_n(R), SU(2)) to model complex relational structures with applications in vision, language, and quantum learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable modeling of complex relational structures including projective transformations, spinor dynamics, and functional symmetries that traditional RBMs cannot capture.

Method: Introduce group-valued weights in RBMs and develop a contextuality index based on group-valued holonomies computed along cycles in the RBM graph to quantify global inconsistency or curvature.

Result: Established links with sheaf-theoretic contextuality, gauge theory, and noncommutative geometry, with numerical and diagrammatic examples in both finite and infinite dimensions.

Conclusion: This framework opens new directions in AI for curvature-aware learning architectures and topological regularization in uncertain or adversarial environments.

Abstract: We propose a geometric extension of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) by
allowing weights to take values in abstract groups such as \(
\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}) \), \( \mathrm{SU}(2) \), or even
infinite-dimensional operator groups. This generalization enables the modeling
of complex relational structures, including projective transformations, spinor
dynamics, and functional symmetries, with direct applications to vision,
language, and quantum learning.
  A central contribution of this work is the introduction of a
\emph{contextuality index} based on group-valued holonomies computed along
cycles in the RBM graph. This index quantifies the global inconsistency or
"curvature" induced by local weights, generalizing classical notions of
coherence, consistency, and geometric flatness. We establish links with
sheaf-theoretic contextuality, gauge theory, and noncommutative geometry, and
provide numerical and diagrammatic examples in both finite and infinite
dimensions.
  This framework opens novel directions in AI, from curvature-aware learning
architectures to topological regularization in uncertain or adversarial
environments.

*Sahil Tyagi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a federated learning technique that combines the parallel scaling benefits of large-batch training with the good generalization of small-batch training to address efficiency and performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges with limited device resources and network constraints. Large-batch training offers parallel scaling but suffers from generalization degradation, while small-batch training has good generalization but higher communication costs.

Method: Proposes a technique that exploits trade-offs between small and large-batch training, aiming to achieve both parallel scaling benefits and good generalization properties.

Result: The proposed large-batch training technique achieves 32.33% higher test accuracy than small-batch training in ResNet50 and 3.74% higher in VGG11 models for the same number of iterations.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the generalization degradation issues of large-batch training while maintaining the parallel scaling advantages, making federated learning more efficient and effective.

Abstract: Efficient Federated learning (FL) is crucial for training deep networks over
devices with limited compute resources and bounded networks. With the advent of
big data, devices either generate or collect multimodal data to train either
generic or local-context aware networks, particularly when data privacy and
locality is vital. FL algorithms generally trade-off between parallel and
statistical performance, improving model quality at the cost of higher
communication frequency, or vice versa. Under frequent synchronization
settings, FL over a large cluster of devices may perform more work per-training
iteration by processing a larger global batch-size, thus attaining considerable
training speedup. However, this may result in poor test performance (i.e., low
test loss or accuracy) due to generalization degradation issues associated with
large-batch training. To address these challenges with large-batches, this work
proposes our vision of exploiting the trade-offs between small and large-batch
training, and explore new directions to enjoy both the parallel scaling of
large-batches and good generalizability of small-batch training. For the same
number of iterations, we observe that our proposed large-batch training
technique attains about 32.33% and 3.74% higher test accuracy than small-batch
training in ResNet50 and VGG11 models respectively.

TL;DR: DualAlign framework enhances synthetic clinical data generation through statistical and semantic alignment, improving both realism and clinical relevance for AI healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in generating realistic synthetic clinical data due to privacy constraints, limited rare-condition data, and biases in real EHRs, while current LLMs struggle to produce clinically meaningful content.

Method: DualAlign framework with two alignment mechanisms: statistical alignment (conditions generation on demographics/risk factors) and semantic alignment (incorporates real symptom trajectories). Applied to Alzheimer's disease case study using LLaMA 3.1-8B model.

Result: Produces context-grounded symptom-level sentences that better reflect real clinical documentation. Fine-tuning with DualAlign-generated + human-annotated data yields substantial performance gains over gold data alone or unguided synthetic baselines.

Conclusion: While not capturing full longitudinal complexity, DualAlign offers practical approach for generating clinically grounded, privacy-preserving synthetic data to support low-resource clinical text analysis.

Abstract: Synthetic clinical data are increasingly important for advancing AI in
healthcare, given strict privacy constraints on real-world EHRs, limited
availability of annotated rare-condition data, and systemic biases in
observational datasets. While large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent
clinical text, producing synthetic data that is both realistic and clinically
meaningful remains challenging. We introduce DualAlign, a framework that
enhances statistical fidelity and clinical plausibility through dual alignment:
(1) statistical alignment, which conditions generation on patient demographics
and risk factors; and (2) semantic alignment, which incorporates real-world
symptom trajectories to guide content generation. Using Alzheimer's disease
(AD) as a case study, DualAlign produces context-grounded symptom-level
sentences that better reflect real-world clinical documentation. Fine-tuning an
LLaMA 3.1-8B model with a combination of DualAlign-generated and
human-annotated data yields substantial performance gains over models trained
on gold data alone or unguided synthetic baselines. While DualAlign does not
fully capture longitudinal complexity, it offers a practical approach for
generating clinically grounded, privacy-preserving synthetic data to support
low-resource clinical text analysis.

Conclusion: GTS Forecaster facilitates the application of deep learning in geodetic forecasting tasks by combining cutting-edge models with an accessible interface for enhanced early warning systems and hazard mitigation.

Abstract: Geodetic time series -- such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
positions, satellite altimetry-derived sea surface height (SSH), and tide gauge
(TG) records -- is essential for monitoring surface deformation and sea level
change. Accurate forecasts of these variables can enhance early warning systems
and support hazard mitigation for earthquakes, landslides, coastal storm surge,

nature of such variables presents significant challenges for classic models,
which often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex spatiotemporal
dynamics. We introduce GTS Forecaster, an open-source Python package for
geodetic time series forecasting. It integrates advanced deep learning models
-- including kernel attention networks (KAN), graph neural network-based gated
recurrent units (GNNGRU), and time-aware graph neural networks (TimeGNN) -- to

*Georgiy A. Bondar,Abhishek Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to find the optimal Multimarginal Schrödinger Bridge over all possible graph structures by solving a minimum spanning tree problem on measure-valued vertices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The MSB formulation requires specifying a correlation structure as an undirected graph a priori. This work aims to find the optimal coupling across all possible graph structures rather than being constrained to a pre-defined one.

Method: The optimal MSB is computed by: 1) constructing a complete graph with edge weights equal to the sum of bimarginal SB optimal values and endpoint entropies, and 2) solving a standard minimum spanning tree problem on this weighted graph.

Result: The authors demonstrate that finding the optimal MSB reduces to solving a minimum spanning tree problem, providing an efficient computational approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently computes the optimal Multimarginal Schrödinger Bridge by transforming the problem into a minimum spanning tree formulation, with numerical experiments validating the approach.

Abstract: The Multimarginal Schr\"odinger Bridge (MSB) finds the optimal coupling among
a collection of random vectors with known statistics and a known correlation
structure. In the MSB formulation, this correlation structure is specified
\emph{a priori} as an undirected connected graph with measure-valued vertices.
In this work, we formulate and solve the problem of finding the optimal MSB in
the sense we seek the optimal coupling over all possible graph structures. We
find that computing the optimal MSB amounts to solving the minimum spanning
tree problem over measure-valued vertices. We show that the resulting problem
can be solved in two steps. The first step constructs a complete graph with
edge weight equal to a sum of the optimal value of the corresponding bimarginal
SB and the entropies of the endpoints. The second step solves a standard
minimum spanning tree problem over that complete weighted graph. Numerical
experiments illustrate the proposed solution.

*Federico J. Gonzalez,Luis P. Lara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework combining differential equation structure with neural networks for nonlinear system identification, using characteristic curves modeled by NNs to balance interpretability and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between interpretability and flexibility in nonlinear system identification by incorporating physical constraints while maintaining neural network flexibility.

Method: Three identification strategies: SINDy-CC (sparse regression with equation constraints), Poly-CC (polynomial representation), and NN-CC (neural networks without basis assumptions) - all using characteristic curves modeled by dedicated NNs.

Result: All three approaches work well for simple polynomial nonlinearities (van der Pol oscillator), but NN-CC shows superior performance for complex nonlinearities and discontinuities (stick-slip systems).

Conclusion: The CC-based framework, especially NN-CC, successfully captures complex nonlinearities while maintaining interpretability through explicit characteristic curve representation, providing a powerful tool for challenging nonlinear system identification.

Abstract: Nonlinear system identification often involves a fundamental trade-off
between interpretability and flexibility, often requiring the incorporation of
physical constraints. We propose a unified data-driven framework that combines
the mathematical structure of the governing differential equations with the
flexibility of neural networks (NNs). At the core of our approach is the
concept of characteristic curves (CCs), which represent individual nonlinear
functions (e.g., friction and restoring components) of the system. Each CC is
modeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation
of the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based
formalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which
extends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the
mathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC,
which represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which
uses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions. Our results
show that all three approaches are well-suited for systems with simple
polynomial nonlinearities, such as the van der Pol oscillator. In contrast,
NN-CC demonstrates superior performance in modeling systems with complex
nonlinearities and discontinuities, such as those observed in stick-slip
systems. The key contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the CC-based
framework, particularly the NN-CC approach, can capture complex nonlinearities
while maintaining interpretability through the explicit representation of the
CCs. This balance makes it well-suited for modeling systems with
discontinuities and complex nonlinearities that are challenging to assess using
traditional polynomial or sparse regression methods, providing a powerful tool
for nonlinear system identification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated GestaltMatcher service enables hospitals to collaboratively train facial dysmorphology AI without sharing patient data, maintaining over 90% of centralized performance while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GestaltMatcher framework relies on centralized datasets, but patient data is siloed across institutions and subject to strict privacy regulations, limiting development and collaboration.

Method: Cross-silo horizontal federated learning framework that maps patient data into shared latent space with privacy-preserving kernel matrix computation, allowing collaborative training without sharing images.

Result: Federated service retains over 90% of centralized performance and remains robust to varying silo numbers and heterogeneous data distributions.

Conclusion: Federated learning enables effective collaboration across hospitals for facial dysmorphology analysis while maintaining patient privacy and data confidentiality.

Abstract: Machine learning has shown promise in facial dysmorphology, where
characteristic facial features provide diagnostic clues for rare genetic
disorders. GestaltMatcher, a leading framework in this field, has demonstrated
clinical utility across multiple studies, but its reliance on centralized
datasets limits further development, as patient data are siloed across
institutions and subject to strict privacy regulations. We introduce a
federated GestaltMatcher service based on a cross-silo horizontal federated
learning framework, which allows hospitals to collaboratively train a global
ensemble feature extractor without sharing patient images. Patient data are
mapped into a shared latent space, and a privacy-preserving kernel matrix
computation framework enables syndrome inference and discovery while
safeguarding confidentiality. New participants can directly benefit from and
contribute to the system by adopting the global feature extractor and kernel
configuration from previous training rounds. Experiments show that the
federated service retains over 90% of centralized performance and remains
robust to both varying silo numbers and heterogeneous data distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Test-Time Warmup method improves MLLM performance by adapting models per test instance using weakly supervised auxiliary tasks, achieving 4-5% improvements on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs underperform on complex reasoning tasks due to limited multimodal training data despite massive pretraining of individual components, creating a need for better adaptation methods.

Method: Proposes Test-Time Warmup that adapts MLLMs per test instance by leveraging data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks instead of extensive labeled fine-tuning datasets.

Result: Achieves relative performance improvements of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA using Llama-Vision-Instruct model.

Conclusion: Warming up MLLMs before inference enhances robustness across diverse reasoning tasks, demonstrating effective test-time adaptation without extensive labeled data.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced
reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully
realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder,
and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text
embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with
billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only
thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on
complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on
extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup
method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly
supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative
performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on
the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up'
before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-supervised goal-reaching enables multi-agent cooperation without complex reward engineering, using sparse goal states instead of scalar rewards


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing reward functions for coordination and long-horizon reasoning in multi-agent systems is challenging, requiring a simpler approach using goal states

Method: Leverage self-supervised goal-reaching techniques where agents maximize likelihood of visiting specified goal states rather than scalar rewards

Result: Outperforms alternative MARL approaches with same sparse reward signal, enables emergent cooperation and exploration without explicit mechanisms

Conclusion: Self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching provides effective alternative to complex reward engineering, enabling cooperation from sparse goal specifications

Abstract: For groups of autonomous agents to achieve a particular goal, they must
engage in coordination and long-horizon reasoning. However, designing reward
functions to elicit such behavior is challenging. In this paper, we study how
self-supervised goal-reaching techniques can be leveraged to enable agents to
cooperate. The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar
reward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This
problem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state
rather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal
is quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching
techniques enable agents to learn from such feedback. On MARL benchmarks, our
proposed method outperforms alternative approaches that have access to the same
sparse reward signal as our method. While our method has no explicit mechanism
for exploration, we observe that self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching
leads to emergent cooperation and exploration in settings where alternative
approaches never witness a single successful trial.

*Bo Lei,Victor M. Castillo,Yeping Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M4GN is a hierarchical graph neural network that uses hybrid segmentation and multi-scale modeling to improve PDE simulation accuracy and efficiency on large meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mesh-based GNNs suffer from high computational cost and over-smoothing on large meshes, while existing hierarchical approaches struggle with building appropriate coarse graphs and maintaining fine-scale accuracy.

Method: Three-tier hierarchical network with hybrid segmentation (graph partitioner + superpixel refinement), permutation-invariant aggregator, micro-level GNN for local dynamics, and macro-level transformer for cross-segment reasoning.

Result: Achieves up to 56% improvement in prediction accuracy and up to 22% faster inference compared to state-of-the-art baselines on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: M4GN provides an effective solution for large-scale PDE simulations by balancing accuracy and efficiency through principled hierarchical modeling and segmentation techniques.

Abstract: Mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have become effective surrogates for
PDE simulations, yet their deep message passing incurs high cost and
over-smoothing on large, long-range meshes; hierarchical GNNs shorten
propagation paths but still face two key obstacles: (i) building coarse graphs
that respect mesh topology, geometry, and physical discontinuities, and (ii)
maintaining fine-scale accuracy without sacrificing the speed gained from
coarsening. We tackle these challenges with M4GN, a three-tier, segment-centric
hierarchical network. M4GN begins with a hybrid segmentation strategy that
pairs a fast graph partitioner with a superpixel-style refinement guided by
modal-decomposition features, producing contiguous segments of dynamically
consistent nodes. These segments are encoded by a permutation-invariant
aggregator, avoiding the order sensitivity and quadratic cost of aggregation
approaches used in prior works. The resulting information bridges a micro-level
GNN, which captures local dynamics, and a macro-level transformer that reasons
efficiently across segments, achieving a principled balance between accuracy
and efficiency. Evaluated on multiple representative benchmark datasets, M4GN
improves prediction accuracy by up to 56% while achieving up to 22% faster
inference than state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting full multi-label annotations is costly and labor-intensive, while many datasets only provide single positive labels per instance despite having multiple relevant labels, creating an extreme partial supervision challenge.

Method: Uses conformal prediction to produce calibrated set-valued outputs, bridging the supervision gap between single-label training and multi-label evaluation without relying on label distribution assumptions.

Result: Evaluated on 12 benchmark datasets, showing consistent improvements over existing baselines and demonstrating practical applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed model-agnostic approach effectively addresses the single-positive multi-label learning problem by leveraging conformal prediction for reliable multi-label predictions without full supervision.

Abstract: Multi-label learning often requires identifying all relevant labels for
training instances, but collecting full label annotations is costly and
labor-intensive. In many datasets, only a single positive label is annotated
per training instance, despite the presence of multiple relevant labels. This
setting, known as single-positive multi-label learning (SPMLL), presents a
significant challenge due to its extreme form of partial supervision. We
propose a model-agnostic approach to SPMLL that draws on conformal prediction
to produce calibrated set-valued outputs, enabling reliable multi-label
predictions at test time. Our method bridges the supervision gap between
single-label training and multi-label evaluation without relying on label
distribution assumptions. We evaluate our approach on 12 benchmark datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over existing baselines and practical
applicability.

TL;DR: Bid shading strategy for first-price auctions formulated as measure-valued convex optimization with regularized Wasserstein-proximal updates and context-aware energy functionals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective bid shading strategy for first-price auctions that optimizes bid parameters distribution to maximize expected surplus by considering win probability and value gap.

Method: Proposes convex optimization over joint distribution of shading parameters with regularized Wasserstein-proximal updates after each auction, using context-aware data-driven energy functionals based on publisher/user attributes.

Result: The measure-valued convex optimization problem admits a closed-form solution, and numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The method provides a principled approach to bid shading in first-price auctions that adapts parameter distributions to maximize expected surplus through regularized optimization updates.

Abstract: This work proposes a bid shading strategy for first-price auctions as a
measure-valued optimization problem. We consider a standard parametric form for
bid shading and formulate the problem as convex optimization over the joint
distribution of shading parameters. After each auction, the shading parameter
distribution is adapted via a regularized Wasserstein-proximal update with a
data-driven energy functional. This energy functional is conditional on the
context, i.e., on publisher/user attributes such as domain, ad slot type,
device, or location. The proposed algorithm encourages the bid distribution to
place more weight on values with higher expected surplus, i.e., where the win
probability and the value gap are both large. We show that the resulting
measure-valued convex optimization problem admits a closed form solution. A
numerical example illustrates the proposed method.

Conclusion: Scalify provides an efficient, scalable solution for detecting silent errors in large ML models, offering actionable debugging guidance and demonstrating practical effectiveness on massive production-scale models.

Abstract: Modern machine learning frameworks support very large models by incorporating
parallelism and optimization techniques. Yet, these very techniques add new
layers of complexity, introducing silent errors that severely degrade model
performance. Existing solutions are either ad hoc or too costly for production.
  We present Scalify, a lightweight framework that exposes silent errors by

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework for sequential fine-tuning of transformers that uses moment propagation, Kalman Bayesian Neural Networks, and Taylor approximations to balance new information with pre-trained knowledge while quantifying uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in sequential learning with shifting distributions, limited data, and latency-critical environments that require uncertainty quantification and stable training.

Method: Frames sequential fine-tuning as posterior inference using Bayesian framework with closed-form moment propagation, Kalman Bayesian Neural Networks, and Taylor approximations of softmax moments.

Result: Achieves robust and data-efficient sequential learning by adaptively balancing pre-trained priors against new information based on quantified uncertainty.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian approach effectively handles sequential fine-tuning with distribution shifts and limited memory, demonstrating practical utility through numerical simulations.

Abstract: Sequential fine-tuning of transformers is useful when new data arrive
sequentially, especially with shifting distributions. Unlike batch learning,
sequential learning demands that training be stabilized despite a small amount
of data by balancing new information and previously learned knowledge in the
pre-trained models. This challenge is further complicated when training is to
be completed in latency-critical environments and learning must additionally
quantify and be mediated by uncertainty. Motivated by these challenges, we
propose a novel method that frames sequential fine-tuning as a posterior
inference problem within a Bayesian framework. Our approach integrates
closed-form moment propagation of random variables, Kalman Bayesian Neural
Networks, and Taylor approximations of the moments of softmax functions. By
explicitly accounting for pre-trained models as priors and adaptively balancing
them against new information based on quantified uncertainty, our method
achieves robust and data-efficient sequential learning. The effectiveness of
our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations involving sequential
adaptation of a decision transformer to tasks characterized by distribution
shifts and limited memory resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting startup success through acquisition or IPO is crucial but challenging due to heterogeneous data types. Traditional ML methods use only structured data with moderate accuracy, while LLMs struggle with domain-specific business data.

Method: CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with unstructured textual narratives using parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies and prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for entrepreneurship data from Crunchbase.

Result: Achieves accuracy exceeding 80% on startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional classifiers and baseline LLMs. Provides interpretable reasoning traces for transparency.

Conclusion: Domain-aware fine-tuning and structured-unstructured data fusion with LLMs can advance predictive modeling of entrepreneurial outcomes, offering a practical tool for venture capital and innovation policy decision making.

Abstract: Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit
through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and
innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured
information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and
unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this
heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine
learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate
accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but
struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present
\textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success
prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with
unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning
strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for
entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on
Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional
classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM
provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing
transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This
work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and
structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of
entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and
a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating complementary sensor data streams (audio and motion) for activity recognition is challenging, especially when limited aligned training data exists for learning shared embedding spaces.

Method: Used large language models for late fusion of modality-specific models on curated Ego4D dataset subset for diverse activity recognition across contexts like household activities and sports.

Result: LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores significantly above chance with no task-specific training.

Conclusion: LLM-based fusion enables multimodal temporal applications without requiring additional memory/computation for application-specific models and works well with limited aligned training data.

Abstract: Sensor data streams provide valuable information around activities and
context for downstream applications, though integrating complementary
information can be challenging. We show that large language models (LLMs) can
be used for late fusion for activity classification from audio and motion time
series data. We curated a subset of data for diverse activity recognition
across contexts (e.g., household activities, sports) from the Ego4D dataset.
Evaluated LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores
significantly above chance, with no task-specific training. Zero-shot
classification via LLM-based fusion from modality-specific models can enable
multimodal temporal applications where there is limited aligned training data
for learning a shared embedding space. Additionally, LLM-based fusion can
enable model deploying without requiring additional memory and computation for
targeted application-specific multimodal models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active learning framework for matched-pair experiments that sequentially targets high treatment-effect regions to reduce experimental costs while ensuring complete coverage of effective areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional matched-pair designs have small overall effect sizes, so the focus shifts to identifying where treatments are most effective to improve efficiency and targeting.

Method: Frames target region identification as a classification problem using active learning tailored to matched-pair designs, sequentially enrolling patients in high-effect regions.

Result: The approach reduces experimental costs for detecting treatment efficacy and ensures identified regions completely cover high-treatment-effect areas.

Conclusion: Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate the framework's efficiency and advantages in practical scenarios for targeted experimental design.

Abstract: Matched-pair experimental designs aim to detect treatment effects by pairing
participants and comparing within-pair outcome differences. In many situations,
the overall effect size is small across the entire population. Then, the focus
naturally shifts to identifying and targeting high treatment-effect regions
where the intervention is most effective. This paper proposes a matched-pair
experimental design that sequentially and actively enrolls patients in high
treatment-effect regions. Importantly, we frame the identification of the
target region as a classification problem and propose an active learning
framework tailored to matched-pair designs. The proposed design not only
reduces the experimental cost of detecting treatment efficacy, but also ensures
that the identified regions enclose the entire high-treatment-effect regions.
Our theoretical analysis of the framework's label complexity, along with
experiments in practical scenarios, demonstrates the efficiency and advantages
of the approach.

TL;DR: HalluField is a novel field-theoretic approach for detecting hallucinations in LLMs using thermodynamics-inspired energy and entropy analysis of token paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce inaccurate or unreliable content (hallucinations), which limits their deployment in high-stakes applications, creating a need for general-purpose hallucination detection methods.

Method: Models LLM responses as discrete likelihood token paths with associated energy and entropy. Analyzes energy and entropy distributions across token paths under temperature and likelihood changes to quantify semantic stability and detect hallucinations through unstable energy landscape behavior.

Result: HalluField achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and datasets, is computationally efficient, and operates directly on model output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural networks.

Conclusion: The thermodynamics-inspired field-theoretic approach provides a principled physical interpretation for hallucination detection and offers a highly practical solution that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning and
question-answering capabilities. However, they often produce inaccurate or
unreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly
limits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing
need for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this
work, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for
hallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and
thermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response
to a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood
token paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By
analyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under
changes in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic
stability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying
unstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is
computationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the
model's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural
networks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical
interpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics.
Remarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField
achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for volunteer engagement in food rescue platforms exacerbate geographical disparities, leaving some communities systematically disadvantaged despite the goal of maximizing food rescued while maintaining volunteer engagement.

Method: Develops Contextual Budget Bandit that incorporates context-dependent budget allocation in restless multi-armed bandits. Creates an empirically fast heuristic algorithm and the Mitosis algorithm (guaranteed optimal budget allocation) to handle scarce volunteer scenarios.

Result: Outperforms baselines on both synthetic and real-world food rescue datasets. Demonstrates achievement of geographical fairness in food rescue while maintaining platform efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms successfully address geographical disparities in food rescue platforms through intelligent budget allocation, ensuring fair distribution of resources across communities while optimizing volunteer engagement and food rescue outcomes.

Abstract: Volunteer-based food rescue platforms tackle food waste by matching surplus
food to communities in need. These platforms face the dual problem of
maintaining volunteer engagement and maximizing the food rescued. Existing
algorithms to improve volunteer engagement exacerbate geographical disparities,
leaving some communities systematically disadvantaged. We address this issue by
proposing Contextual Budget Bandit. Contextual Budget Bandit incorporates
context-dependent budget allocation in restless multi-armed bandits, a model of
decision-making which allows for stateful arms. By doing so, we can allocate
higher budgets to communities with lower match rates, thereby alleviating
geographical disparities. To tackle this problem, we develop an empirically
fast heuristic algorithm. Because the heuristic algorithm can achieve a poor
approximation when active volunteers are scarce, we design the Mitosis
algorithm, which is guaranteed to compute the optimal budget allocation.
Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms outperform baselines on both
synthetic and real-world food rescue datasets, and show how our algorithm
achieves geographical fairness in food rescue.

Motivation: Transformers are widely used but their robustness under fault conditions remains underexplored, especially for large language models facing hardware faults.

Method: A modular Python-based framework that injects diverse fault types (weight corruption, activation injections, attention disruptions) into pretrained transformer models at multiple structural points.

Result: Provides a unified platform with experiment reproducibility, metric logging, and visualization capabilities for robustness analysis of transformer models.

Conclusion: GoldenTransformer offers researchers and practitioners a valuable tool for model robustness analysis and dependable system design in real-world LLM applications.

Abstract: Transformers have become the foundation for a wide range of
state--of--the--art models across natural language processing, computer vision,
and other machine learning domains. Despite their widespread deployment, the
robustness of these models under fault conditions remains underexplored. We
present GoldenTransformer, a modular and extensible fault injection framework
designed to evaluate the resiliency of Large Language Models to induced
hardware faults. GoldenTransformer offers a unified Python-based platform for
injecting diverse classes of faults--such as weight corruption, activation
injections, and attention--level disruptions--into pretrained
transformer--based models. Inspired by the GoldenEye simulator for DNNs, our
framework focuses on the unique challenges of working with large transformer
architectures, including considerations such as structural complexity, latent
dependencies, and nonuniform layer definitions. GoldenTransformer is built atop
PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers, and it supports experiment
reproducibility, metric logging, and visualization out of the box. We detail
the technical design and use of GoldenTransformer and demonstrate through
several example experiments on classification and generation tasks. By enabling
controlled injection of faults at multiple logical and structural points in a
transformer, GoldenTransformer offers researchers and practitioners a valuable
tool for model robustness analysis and for guiding dependable system design in
real-world LLM applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an encoder-focused debiasing method for Sparse Autoencoders that challenges the conventional assumption about feature representations being in decoder weights, achieving significant improvements in fairness metrics while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAE-based debiasing methods assume feature representations are in decoder weights and manipulate sparse activations. The authors challenge this fundamental assumption and seek a more effective encoder-focused approach.

Method: Proposes Selection and Projection framework (S&P TopK) with three key components: (i) unconventional SAE feature selection strategy, (ii) orthogonalizing input embeddings against encoder weights for debiasing, and (iii) encoder weight interpolation to preserve performance during debiasing.

Result: The method surpasses conventional SAE usage in fairness metrics by up to 3.2x and advances state-of-the-art test-time VLM debiasing results by up to 1.8x while maintaining downstream performance.

Conclusion: Encoder-focused debiasing through orthogonalization and weight interpolation provides superior fairness improvements compared to traditional decoder-focused approaches, demonstrating the value of challenging fundamental assumptions in representation learning.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven valuable due to their ability to
provide interpretable and steerable representations. Current debiasing methods
based on SAEs manipulate these sparse activations presuming that feature
representations are housed within decoder weights. We challenge this
fundamental assumption and introduce an encoder-focused alternative for
representation debiasing, contributing three key findings: (i) we highlight an
unconventional SAE feature selection strategy, (ii) we propose a novel SAE
debiasing methodology that orthogonalizes input embeddings against encoder
weights, and (iii) we establish a performance-preserving mechanism during
debiasing through encoder weight interpolation. Our Selection and Projection
framework, termed S\&P TopK, surpasses conventional SAE usage in fairness
metrics by a factor of up to 3.2 and advances state-of-the-art test-time VLM
debiasing results by a factor of up to 1.8 while maintaining downstream
performance.

Result: Improves rank preservation and optimal configuration identification, reduces decision-making risks, and delivers stable performance gains across diverse datasets and design conditions.

Conclusion: Provides a tuning foundation that offers interpretable justification alongside stable performance improvements even under budget constraints, with theoretical guarantees on error bounds and sample complexity.

Abstract: We propose FACTORS, a framework that combines design of experiments with
Shapley decomposition to address performance and stability issues that are
sensitive to combinations of training factors. Our approach consistently
estimates main effects and two-factor interactions, then integrates them into a
risk-adjusted objective function that jointly accounts for uncertainty and
cost, enabling reliable selection of configurations under a fixed budget.
Effect estimation is implemented through two complementary paths: a plug-in
path based on conditional means, and a least-squares path that reconstructs
Shapley contributions from samples. These paths are designed to work
complementarily even when design density and bias levels differ. By
incorporating standardization of estimates, bias correction, and uncertainty
quantification, our procedure ensures comparability across heterogeneous factor
spaces and designs, while a lightweight search routine yields configurations
within practical time even for large factor spaces. On the theoretical side, we
provide error decompositions, sample complexity analysis, and upper bounds on
optimality gaps. On the interpretive side, we summarize main effects and
interactions in map form, highlighting adjustment priorities and safe
improvement pathways. Across diverse datasets and design conditions, our
approach improves rank preservation and optimal configuration identification,
reduces decision-making risks, and offers a tuning foundation that delivers
interpretable justification alongside stable performance gains even under
budget constraints.

*Mayssa Soussia,Yijun Lin,Mohamed Ali Mahjoub,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CogGNN is the first cognified generative model that integrates cognitive capabilities into graph neural networks to generate brain networks preserving both structural and cognitive features, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative methods for brain networks focus only on structural properties while neglecting cognitive traits, which are crucial for understanding brain functions like pattern recognition and memory recall.

Method: CogGNN integrates visual input and cognitive capabilities into GNNs using a visual-memory-based loss function and co-optimization strategy to generate connectional brain templates that preserve cognitive features.

Result: Extensive experiments show CogGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating brain networks that are both structurally and cognitively meaningful.

Conclusion: CogGNN establishes a strong foundation for cognitively grounded brain network modeling by successfully integrating cognitive properties into generative frameworks.

Abstract: Generative learning has advanced network neuroscience, enabling tasks like
graph super-resolution, temporal graph prediction, and multimodal brain graph
fusion. However, current methods, mainly based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
focus solely on structural and topological properties, neglecting cognitive
traits. To address this, we introduce the first cognified generative model,
CogGNN, which endows GNNs with cognitive capabilities (e.g., visual memory) to
generate brain networks that preserve cognitive features. While broadly
applicable, we present CogGNN, a specific variant designed to integrate visual
input, a key factor in brain functions like pattern recognition and memory
recall. As a proof of concept, we use our model to learn connectional brain
templates (CBTs), population-level fingerprints from multi-view brain networks.
Unlike prior work that overlooks cognitive properties, CogGNN generates CBTs
that are both cognitively and structurally meaningful. Our contributions are:
(i) a novel cognition-aware generative model with a visual-memory-based loss;
(ii) a CBT-learning framework with a co-optimization strategy to yield
well-centered, discriminative, cognitively enhanced templates. Extensive
experiments show that CogGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing
a strong foundation for cognitively grounded brain network modeling.

*Mingkang Li,Xuexiong Luo,Yue Zhang,Yaoyang Li,Fu Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel graph anomaly detection framework using Transformer encoder, memory-guided reconstruction, and multi-scale matching to overcome over-smoothing and anomalous node interference issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph anomaly detection methods suffer from over-smoothing in GCNs and vulnerability to anomalous node interference in reconstruction-based approaches, making accurate anomaly detection challenging.

Method: Proposes a holistic framework with three components: local-global Transformer encoder for structural dependencies, memory-guided reconstruction to suppress anomalous influence, and multi-scale representation matching for granular anomaly assessment.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating robust performance across various graph domains.

Conclusion: The framework provides a comprehensive and generalizable solution for graph anomaly detection by effectively addressing key limitations of existing methods through synergistic integration of multiple components.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging
problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the
majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing
methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often
suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to
become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches
are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction
process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a
novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key
components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction
mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components
work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and
global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and
assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are
computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals,
resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly
detection across various graph domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simplified MPNN architecture with bidirectional message-passing and attention mechanism achieves state-of-the-art molecular property prediction performance, outperforming complex pre-trained models while reducing computational costs by 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve molecular property prediction performance by simplifying message-passing mechanisms and using descriptors that capture multiple aspects of molecular graphs, while reducing computational complexity.

Method: Designed MPNN architectures with bidirectional message-passing and attention mechanisms, using minimalist message formulation without self-perception. Tested various approaches including convolution normalization factors, spatial features, and 3D graphs vs 2D graphs with 3D descriptors.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance surpassing complex pre-trained models. Found that simpler models yield higher class separability, convolution normalization doesn't help, and 2D graphs with 3D descriptors preserve performance while reducing computational cost by over 50%.

Conclusion: Simpler MPNN architectures with appropriate feature selection outperform complex models, with 2D graphs complemented by 3D descriptors providing optimal balance of performance and computational efficiency for high-throughput screening.

Abstract: Strategies to improve the predicting performance of Message-Passing
Neural-Networks for molecular property predictions can be achieved by
simplifying how the message is passed and by using descriptors that capture
multiple aspects of molecular graphs. In this work, we designed model
architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more
complex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed
dataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that
structural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs
and feature sets.
  In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing
with an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that
excludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared
to classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that
convolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all
the datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level
outputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial
features and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are
sufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors. This
approach not only preserves predictive performance but also reduces
computational cost by over 50%, making it particularly advantageous for
high-throughput screening campaigns.

*Ali Hedayatnia,Mostafa Tavassolipour,Babak Nadjar Araabi,Abdol-Hossein Vahabie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a method to address covariate shift in diffusion-based randomized smoothing by training base classifiers with an adversarial objective focused on noise misestimation, achieving SOTA certified robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Denoised Smoothing introduces covariate shift through misestimation of added noise, degrading certified robustness performance.

Method: Novel adversarial objective function that trains base classifiers to be robust against covariate shift from denoising diffusion models' noise misestimation.

Result: Significantly improves certified accuracy across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art performance for l2-adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: Addressing covariate shift in diffusion-based randomized smoothing through targeted adversarial training enables superior certified robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a well-established method for achieving certified
robustness against l2-adversarial perturbations. By incorporating a denoiser
before the base classifier, pretrained classifiers can be seamlessly integrated
into randomized smoothing without significant performance degradation. Among
existing methods, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing - where a pretrained denoising
diffusion model serves as the denoiser - has produced state-of-the-art results.
However, we show that employing a denoising diffusion model introduces a
covariate shift via misestimation of the added noise, ultimately degrading the
smoothed classifier's performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel
adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of the denoising
diffusion model. This approach is inspired by our understanding of the origin
of the covariate shift. Our goal is to train the base classifier to ensure it
is robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser. Our method
significantly improves certified accuracy across three standard classification
benchmarks - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - achieving new state-of-the-art
performance in l2-adversarial perturbations. Our implementation is publicly

*Wenbo Lu,Shaoyi Zheng,Yuxuan Xia,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ToMA is a GPU-efficient token reduction method for diffusion models that reformulates token merging as submodular optimization and uses attention-like linear transformations, achieving 24-23% latency reduction while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu have theoretical speedups but introduce GPU-inefficient operations (sorting, scattered writes) that negate practical benefits when paired with optimized attention implementations like FlashAttention.

Method: 1) Reformulates token merge as submodular optimization to select diverse tokens 2) Implements merge/unmerge as attention-like linear transformation using GPU-friendly matrix operations 3) Exploits latent locality and sequential redundancy to minimize overhead

Result: Reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23% respectively with minimal quality degradation (DINO Δ < 0.07), outperforming prior token reduction methods

Conclusion: ToMA bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion models by providing GPU-aligned token reduction that delivers actual speed improvements without sacrificing image quality

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability
limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token
reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens
in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting,
scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when
paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To
bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf
method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three
key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular
optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an
attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3)
exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to
minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%,
respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This
work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for
transformers in diffusion.

### [110] [Clarifying Model Transparency: Interpretability versus Explainability in Deep Learning with MNIST and IMDB Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10929)
*Mitali Raj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper distinguishes between interpretability (global model understanding) and explainability (local post-hoc explanations) in deep learning, using MNIST and IMDB examples to demonstrate that local explanations don't make complex models globally transparent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the black box problem in deep learning that hinders AI adoption in high-trust domains by clarifying the distinct concepts of interpretability and explainability under the XAI umbrella.

Method: Comparative analysis of interpretability vs explainability through illustrative examinations of MNIST digit classification and IMDB sentiment analysis tasks, analyzing definitions, objectives, methodologies, and challenges.

Result: Establishes that interpretability refers to a model's inherent capacity for global human comprehension, while explainability involves post-hoc techniques for local explanations of individual predictions (e.g., feature attribution for MNIST digits, word importance for sentiment analysis).

Conclusion: Clear differentiation between interpretability and explainability is crucial for developing dependable AI, as local explanations do not provide global transparency of complex underlying models.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of deep learning models are often counterbalanced
by their inherent opacity, commonly termed the "black box" problem, which
impedes their widespread acceptance in high-trust domains. In response, the
intersecting disciplines of interpretability and explainability, collectively
falling under the Explainable AI (XAI) umbrella, have become focal points of
research. Although these terms are frequently used as synonyms, they carry
distinct conceptual weights. This document offers a comparative exploration of
interpretability and explainability within the deep learning paradigm,
carefully outlining their respective definitions, objectives, prevalent
methodologies, and inherent difficulties. Through illustrative examinations of
the MNIST digit classification task and IMDB sentiment analysis, we
substantiate a key argument: interpretability generally pertains to a model's
inherent capacity for human comprehension of its operational mechanisms (global
understanding), whereas explainability is more commonly associated with
post-hoc techniques designed to illuminate the basis for a model's individual
predictions or behaviors (local explanations). For example, feature attribution
methods can reveal why a specific MNIST image is recognized as a '7', and
word-level importance can clarify an IMDB sentiment outcome. However, these
local insights do not render the complex underlying model globally transparent.
A clear grasp of this differentiation, as demonstrated by these standard
datasets, is vital for fostering dependable and sound artificial intelligence.

*Joshua Au Yeung,Jacopo Dalmasso,Luca Foschini,Richard JB Dobson,Zeljko Kraljevic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs show concerning psychogenic potential by reinforcing delusions and enabling harmful behaviors in vulnerable users, with safety interventions occurring in only one-third of applicable scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging reports of 'AI psychosis' where LLM interactions may exacerbate or induce psychosis in vulnerable users, particularly due to LLMs' sycophantic nature reinforcing delusional beliefs.

Method: Developed psychosis-bench benchmark with 16 structured, 12-turn conversational scenarios simulating delusional themes progression. Evaluated 8 LLMs across Delusion Confirmation, Harm Enablement, and Safety Intervention scores in explicit and implicit contexts.

Result: All LLMs demonstrated psychogenic potential (mean DCS 0.91), frequently enabled harmful requests (mean HES 0.69), and offered safety interventions in only ~33% of applicable turns (mean SIS 0.37). 39.8% of scenarios had no safety interventions. Performance worse in implicit scenarios with strong correlation between delusion confirmation and harm enablement.

Conclusion: LLM psychogenicity is a quantifiable risk requiring urgent re-thinking of LLM training approaches. This is not just a technical challenge but a public health imperative needing collaboration between developers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals.

Abstract: Background: Emerging reports of "AI psychosis" are on the rise, where
user-LLM interactions may exacerbate or induce psychosis or adverse
psychological symptoms. The sycophantic and agreeable nature of LLMs can
beneficial, it can become a vector for harm by reinforcing delusional beliefs
in vulnerable users.
  Methods: We introduce psychosis-bench, a novel benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate the psychogenicity of LLMs comprimising 16 structured,
12-turn conversational scenarios simulating the progression of delusional
themes(Erotic Delusions, Grandiose/Messianic Delusions, Referential Delusions)
and potential harms. We evaluated eight prominent LLMs for Delusion
Confirmation (DCS), Harm Enablement (HES), and Safety Intervention(SIS) across
explicit and implicit conversational contexts.
  Findings: Across 1,536 simulated conversation turns, all LLMs demonstrated
psychogenic potential, showing a strong tendency to perpetuate rather than
challenge delusions (mean DCS of 0.91 $\pm$0.88). Models frequently enabled
harmful user requests (mean HES of 0.69 $\pm$0.84) and offered safety
interventions in only roughly a third of applicable turns (mean SIS of 0.37
$\pm$0.48). 51 / 128 (39.8%) of scenarios had no safety interventions offered.
Performance was significantly worse in implicit scenarios, models were more
likely to confirm delusions and enable harm while offering fewer interventions
(p < .001). A strong correlation was found between DCS and HES (rs = .77).
Model performance varied widely, indicating that safety is not an emergent
property of scale alone.
  Conclusion: This study establishes LLM psychogenicity as a quantifiable risk
and underscores the urgent need for re-thinking how we train LLMs. We frame
this issue not merely as a technical challenge but as a public health
imperative requiring collaboration between developers, policymakers, and
healthcare professionals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHLoRA extracts LoRA adapters from fine-tuned models without training data or gradients, enabling scalable inference and cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize scalable inference by extracting adapter modules from existing full-rank fine-tuned models without requiring access to original training data or gradients.

Method: Computes low-rank decomposition of weight differences between base model and fine-tuned counterpart to reconstruct adapter modules that can be merged or dynamically routed.

Result: Extracted adapters preserve high energy from full weight delta, can be safely pruned, and show negligible performance degradation when re-merged across text, image, and video benchmarks.

Conclusion: PHLoRA provides a practical solution to make all existing full-rank checkpoints adapter-ready, enabling scalable inference for all models.

Abstract: We introduce PHLoRA (Pronounced "flora"). (Post-hoc LoRA), a simple yet
powerful method to extract low-rank adaptation adapters from full-rank
fine-tuned models without requiring access to training data or gradients. By
computing the low-rank decomposition of weight differences between a base model
and its fine-tuned counterpart, our method reconstructs adapter modules that
can be merged or dynamically routed at inference time via S-LoRA, or served in
scalable, industry settings using platforms like NVIDIA NIM. This approach
amortizes latency overhead across requests and yields substantial cost savings.
Unlike prior work that trains each adapter explicitly, our approach decouples
fine-tuning from adapter generation, allowing adapter extraction from existing
full-rank models or third-party checkpoints. Experiments on text, image, and
video benchmarks using the Amazon Nova model family demonstrate that extracted
adapters preserve high energy from the full weight delta, can be pruned safely,
and yield negligible degradation in downstream task performance when re-merged.
Overall, PHLoRA provides a practical path for making all existing full-rank
checkpoints adapter-ready, democratizing scalable inference for all models.

### [113] [Decoupling Search and Learning in Neural Net Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10973)
*Akshay Vegesna,Samip Dahal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework that separates search in representation space from gradient-based learning to find diverse minima that generalize better than standard gradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient descent converges to single minima without exploring alternatives that may generalize better. Direct search in high-dimensional parameter space is intractable.

Method: Two-phase training: 1) Evolutionary search in intermediate activation space to find diverse representational solutions, 2) Gradient-based learning by regressing to those representations in parameter space.

Result: Searched representations are learnable and approach SGD performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100. Performance improves with search compute. Models follow different representational trajectories than gradient descent.

Conclusion: Decoupling search in representation space from gradient-based learning can overcome gradient descent's exploratory limitations, enabling discovery of diverse solutions that may generalize better.

Abstract: Gradient descent typically converges to a single minimum of the training loss
without mechanisms to explore alternative minima that may generalize better.
Searching for diverse minima directly in high-dimensional parameter space is
generally intractable. To address this, we propose a framework that performs
training in two distinct phases: search in a tractable representation space
(the space of intermediate activations) to find diverse representational
solutions, and gradient-based learning in parameter space by regressing to
those searched representations. Through evolutionary search, we discover
representational solutions whose fitness and diversity scale with
compute--larger populations and more generations produce better and more varied
solutions. These representations prove to be learnable: networks trained by
regressing to searched representations approach SGD's performance on MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Performance improves with search compute up to
saturation. The resulting models differ qualitatively from networks trained
with gradient descent, following different representational trajectories during
training. This work demonstrates how future training algorithms could overcome
gradient descent's exploratory limitations by decoupling search in
representation space from efficient gradient-based learning in parameter space.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAWFI is a comprehensive California wildfire database with 37M+ data points from 2012-2022, combining meteorological, environmental, and geological indicators to enable predictive AI models that can prevent wildfires before ignition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change is increasing wildfire frequency and severity globally, but most current AI solutions only detect fires after ignition. There's a need for predictive techniques that require extensive datasets to train accurate machine learning models.

Method: The paper presents CAWFI - a database compiling daily historical California wildfire data (2012-2018) and indicator data (2012-2022) including: leading indicators (meteorological data), trailing indicators (environmental data), and geological indicators (vegetation and elevation data).

Result: CAWFI has demonstrated success training a spatio-temporal AI model that predicted 85.7% of future wildfires larger than 300,000 acres when trained on 2012-2017 indicator data.

Conclusion: This dataset enables wildfire prediction research and solutions, potentially preventing megafires by addressing them before ignition, and sets a precedent for future wildfire databases in other regions.

Abstract: Due to climate change and the disruption of ecosystems worldwide, wildfires
are increasingly impacting environment, infrastructure, and human lives
globally. Additionally, an exacerbating climate crisis means that these losses
would continue to grow if preventative measures are not implemented. Though
recent advancements in artificial intelligence enable wildfire management
techniques, most deployed solutions focus on detecting wildfires after
ignition. The development of predictive techniques with high accuracy requires
extensive datasets to train machine learning models. This paper presents the
California Wildfire Inventory (CAWFI), a wildfire database of over 37 million
data points for building and training wildfire prediction solutions, thereby
potentially preventing megafires and flash fires by addressing them before they
spark. The dataset compiles daily historical California wildfire data from 2012
to 2018 and indicator data from 2012 to 2022. The indicator data consists of
leading indicators (meteorological data correlating to wildfire-prone
conditions), trailing indicators (environmental data correlating to prior and
early wildfire activity), and geological indicators (vegetation and elevation
data dictating wildfire risk and spread patterns). CAWFI has already
demonstrated success when used to train a spatio-temporal artificial
intelligence model, predicting 85.7% of future wildfires larger than 300,000
acres when trained on 2012-2017 indicator data. This dataset is intended to
enable wildfire prediction research and solutions as well as set a precedent
for future wildfire databases in other regions.

TL;DR: FragmentGPT is a novel AI framework that generates optimized molecular linkers for fragment-based drug discovery, handling structural redundancies and multi-objective pharmaceutical optimization through chemically-aware pre-training and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragment-based drug discovery faces challenges in designing effective linkers to combine molecular fragments, especially when fragments contain structural redundancies like duplicate rings that cannot be addressed by simple atom/bond modifications.

Method: Integrates two core components: 1) chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training for GPT-based fragment manipulation capabilities, and 2) Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration algorithm combining expert imitation learning, data selection/augmentation, and supervised fine-tuning for multi-objective optimization.

Result: Generates chemically valid, high-quality molecules tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks, successfully connecting diverse molecular subunits while resolving structural redundancies through intelligent merging.

Conclusion: FragmentGPT provides a unified framework for controlled, goal-driven molecular assembly that addresses key challenges in fragment-based drug discovery, demonstrating effectiveness on real-world cancer datasets.

Abstract: Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug
development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular
fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains
challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural
redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding
or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework,
we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel
chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips
the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities,
and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm
that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data
selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective
goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that
connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple
pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as
duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of
optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular
assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets
demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules
tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.

TL;DR: Simple time-stratified sampling achieves similar/better performance than full-data training for autoregressive diffusion weather forecasting models, using only 20% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive diffusion models for ensemble weather forecasting are computationally expensive, which is problematic in climate science where data is limited, costly, or difficult to work with.

Method: Evaluated several data sampling strategies, focusing on time stratified sampling approach to reduce training data requirements while maintaining performance.

Result: Time stratified sampling achieved performance similar to or better than full-data training, outperforming on certain metrics and performing only slightly worse on others while using only 20% of training data.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training for weather forecasting and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling methods beyond random or temporal sampling.

Abstract: Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field,
recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown
promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically
autoregressive and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in
climate science, where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with.
In this work, we explore the impact of curated data selection on these
autoregressive diffusion models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies
and show that a simple time stratified sampling approach achieves performance
similar to or better than full-data training. Notably, it outperforms the
full-data model on certain metrics and performs only slightly worse on others
while using only 20% of the training data. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for weather
forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling
methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.

Conclusion: DAC-FCF provides a promising solution for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data conditions, effectively addressing data scarcity and feature extraction challenges.

Abstract: In the area of bearing fault diagnosis, deep learning (DL) methods have been
widely used recently. However, due to the high cost or privacy concerns,
high-quality labeled data are scarce in real world scenarios. While few-shot
learning has shown promise in addressing data scarcity, existing methods still
face significant limitations in this domain. Traditional data augmentation
techniques often suffer from mode collapse and generate low-quality samples
that fail to capture the diversity of bearing fault patterns. Moreover,
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with local receptive fields
makes them inadequate for extracting global features from complex vibration
signals. Additionally, existing methods fail to model the intricate
relationships between limited training samples. To solve these problems, we
propose an advanced data augmentation and contrastive fourier convolution
framework (DAC-FCF) for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data. Firstly, a
novel conditional consistent latent representation and reconstruction
generative adversarial network (CCLR-GAN) is proposed to generate more diverse
data. Secondly, a contrastive learning based joint optimization mechanism is
utilized to better model the relations between the available training data.
Finally, we propose a 1D fourier convolution neural network (1D-FCNN) to
achieve a global-aware of the input data. Experiments demonstrate that DAC-FCF
achieves significant improvements, outperforming baselines by up to 32\% on
case western reserve university (CWRU) dataset and 10\% on a self-collected
test bench. Extensive ablation experiments prove the effectiveness of the
proposed components. Thus, the proposed DAC-FCF offers a promising solution for
bearing fault diagnosis under limited data.

*Khoa Tran,Pranav Gupta,Manos Papagelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GCN-TULHOR is a graph-based method that transforms sparse location data into higher-order mobility flows using hexagonal tessellation and GCNs, achieving 1-8% performance gains in trajectory-user linking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TUL methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and limited spatial dependency modeling, often relying on low-level check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns.

Method: Transforms raw location data into higher-order mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to model complex spatial relationships without requiring side information.

Result: Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, achieving 1-8% relative gains in accuracy and F1-score.

Conclusion: Combining graph-based spatial learning with sequential modeling offers a robust and scalable solution for TUL with applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.

Abstract: Trajectory-user linking (TUL) aims to associate anonymized trajectories with
the users who generated them, which is crucial for personalized
recommendations, privacy-preserving analytics, and secure location-based
services. Existing methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and
limited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level
check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns. In this paper, we introduced
GCN-TULHOR, a method that transforms raw location data into higher-order
mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, reducing data
sparsity and capturing richer spatial semantics, and integrating Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach converts both sparse check-in and
continuous GPS trajectory data into unified higher-order flow representations,
mitigating sparsity while capturing deeper semantic information. The GCN layer
explicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies
without requiring side information such as timestamps or points of interest.
Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over
classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, and the TULHOR method
in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. GCN-TULHOR achieves 1-8% relative
gains in accuracy and F1. Sensitivity analysis identifies an optimal setup with
a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings. The integration of GCNs
enhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data.
This work highlights the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with
sequential modeling, offering a robust and scalable solution for TUL with
applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Foundation Models focus on textual/visual data but overlook rich semantic, spatial, and topological features in BIM models, creating a gap in multidimensional design feature learning and reuse.

Method: Developed BIGNet with scalable graph representation for BIM components, created 1M node/3.5M edge dataset, introduced new message-passing mechanism to GraphMAE2, and used node masking pretraining strategy.

Result: Homogeneous graph representation outperformed heterogeneous; 30cm local spatial relationships enhanced performance; GAT-based feature extraction achieved best transfer learning results with 72.7% F1-score improvement.

Conclusion: BIGNet effectively learns and transfers BIM design features, demonstrating strong potential for automated application in design checking and lifecycle management of building information models.

Abstract: Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in
civil engineering, but they primarily focus on textual and visual data,
overlooking the rich semantic, spatial, and topological features in BIM
(Building Information Modelling) models. Therefore, this study develops the
first large-scale graph neural network (GNN), BIGNet, to learn, and reuse
multidimensional design features embedded in BIM models. Firstly, a scalable
graph representation is introduced to encode the "semantic-spatial-topological"
features of BIM components, and a dataset with nearly 1 million nodes and 3.5
million edges is created. Subsequently, BIGNet is proposed by introducing a new
message-passing mechanism to GraphMAE2 and further pretrained with a node
masking strategy. Finally, BIGNet is evaluated in various transfer learning
tasks for BIM-based design checking. Results show that: 1) homogeneous graph
representation outperforms heterogeneous graph in learning design features, 2)
considering local spatial relationships in a 30 cm radius enhances performance,
and 3) BIGNet with GAT (Graph Attention Network)-based feature extraction
achieves the best transfer learning results. This innovation leads to a 72.7%
improvement in Average F1-score over non-pretrained models, demonstrating its
effectiveness in learning and transferring BIM design features and facilitating
their automated application in future design and lifecycle management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persian names present unique challenges for NLP applications due to transliteration inconsistencies and cultural-specific naming patterns, with existing tools showing poor performance and limited datasets available.

Method: Created PNGT-26K dataset with 26,000 Persian name-gender-transliteration tuples, and developed two frameworks: Open Gender Detection (probabilistic gender detection using profile data) and Nominalist (AI agent for username generation).

Result: The paper delivers a publicly available comprehensive dataset and two ready-to-use frameworks that address Persian name processing challenges in gender detection and digital identity creation.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset and frameworks provide valuable resources for improving Persian NLP applications, particularly in gender detection and username generation, with both tools being publicly available on GitHub for community use.

Abstract: Persian names present unique challenges for natural language processing
applications, particularly in gender detection and digital identity creation,
due to transliteration inconsistencies and cultural-specific naming patterns.
Existing tools exhibit significant performance degradation on Persian names,
while the scarcity of comprehensive datasets further compounds these
limitations. To address these challenges, the present research introduces
PNGT-26K, a comprehensive dataset of Persian names, their commonly associated
gender, and their English transliteration, consisting of approximately 26,000
tuples. As a demonstration of how this resource can be utilized, we also
introduce two frameworks, namely Open Gender Detection and Nominalist. Open
Gender Detection is a production-grade, ready-to-use framework for using
existing data from a user, such as profile photo and name, to give a
probabilistic guess about the person's gender. Nominalist, the second framework
introduced by this paper, utilizes agentic AI to help users choose a username
for their social media accounts on any platform. It can be easily integrated
into any website to provide a better user experience. The PNGT-26K dataset,
Nominalist and Open Gender Detection frameworks are publicly available on
Github.

*Einari Vaaras,Manu Airaksinen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hopkins loss uses Hopkins statistic to modify feature space topology in ML applications, showing minimal impact on classification performance while providing topology modification benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature space topology modification can benefit various ML applications, but existing methods focus on preserving input topology rather than enforcing desired topology.

Method: Introduces Hopkins loss function based on Hopkins statistic to enforce desired feature space topology in classification and dimensionality reduction tasks using nonlinear bottleneck autoencoders.

Result: Experiments on speech, text, and image data show Hopkins loss integration has small impact on classification performance while successfully modifying feature topology.

Conclusion: Hopkins loss effectively modifies feature space topology with minimal performance degradation, offering benefits for dimensionality reduction, generative modeling, transfer learning, and adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Feature space topology refers to the organization of samples within the
feature space. Modifying this topology can be beneficial in machine learning
applications, including dimensionality reduction, generative modeling, transfer
learning, and robustness to adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a novel
loss function, Hopkins loss, which leverages the Hopkins statistic to enforce a
desired feature space topology, which is in contrast to existing
topology-related methods that aim to preserve input feature topology. We
evaluate the effectiveness of Hopkins loss on speech, text, and image data in
two scenarios: classification and dimensionality reduction using nonlinear
bottleneck autoencoders. Our experiments show that integrating Hopkins loss
into classification or dimensionality reduction has only a small impact on
classification performance while providing the benefit of modifying feature
topology.

*Santhosh G S,Saurav Prakash,Balaraman Ravindran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AQUA reduces attention computation cost by 25% with minimal performance impact using query magnitude-based dimension selection and SVD projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic complexity of attention mechanism creates computational and memory bottlenecks for scaling LLMs to longer contexts.

Method: Two-phase approach: offline SVD projection matrix computation on calibration data, and online inference with query magnitude-based sparse dimension selection.

Result: 25% reduction in attention dot-product computation with statistically insignificant performance impact on Llama-3.1-8B across benchmarks.

Conclusion: AQUA provides a practical efficiency-accuracy trade-off tool that accelerates existing methods and reduces KV-cache memory, making LLM inference more accessible.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental
barrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a
critical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we
introduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile
approximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a
graceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient
offline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix
via SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project
query and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions
based on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of
AQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more
computationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in
the attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically
insignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We
further showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to
synergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to
directly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to
balance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool
for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.

*Dat-Thinh Nguyen,Kim-Hung Le,Nhien-An Le-Khac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaDFME is a novel data-free model extraction method that uses meta-learning to stabilize substitute model accuracy by reducing distribution shift in synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-free model extraction methods suffer from oscillating accuracy in substitute models due to constant distribution shifts in generated data, making attacks impractical without access to target model's in-distribution data.

Method: Uses meta-learning in generator training to iteratively capture meta-representations of synthetic data. These representations can be adapted with few steps to produce data that helps substitute model learn from target while reducing distribution shift effects.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art data-free model extraction methods on MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets while exhibiting more stable substitute model accuracy during attack.

Conclusion: MetaDFME effectively mitigates accuracy oscillation in data-free model extraction through meta-learning approach, making the attack more practical and stable.

Abstract: Model extraction is a severe threat to Machine Learning-as-a-Service systems,
especially through data-free approaches, where dishonest users can replicate
the functionality of a black-box target model without access to realistic data.
Despite recent advancements, existing data-free model extraction methods suffer
from the oscillating accuracy of the substitute model. This oscillation, which
could be attributed to the constant shift in the generated data distribution
during the attack, makes the attack impractical since the optimal substitute
model cannot be determined without access to the target model's in-distribution
data. Hence, we propose MetaDFME, a novel data-free model extraction method
that employs meta-learning in the generator training to reduce the distribution
shift, aiming to mitigate the substitute model's accuracy oscillation. In
detail, we train our generator to iteratively capture the meta-representations
of the synthetic data during the attack. These meta-representations can be
adapted with a few steps to produce data that facilitates the substitute model
to learn from the target model while reducing the effect of distribution
shifts. Our experiments on popular baseline image datasets, MNIST, SVHN,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrate that MetaDFME outperforms the current
state-of-the-art data-free model extraction method while exhibiting a more
stable substitute model's accuracy during the attack.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GK-SMOTE is a hyperparameter-free, noise-resilient oversampling method that uses Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation to generate synthetic minority samples in safe regions while avoiding noisy areas, outperforming existing techniques on imbalanced classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional oversampling techniques like SMOTE struggle with label noise and complex data distributions, leading to reduced classification accuracy in critical applications like medical diagnosis and fraud detection.

Method: GK-SMOTE extends SMOTE using Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation to differentiate between safe and noisy regions, generating synthetic samples in high-density minority areas without requiring parameter tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse binary classification datasets show GK-SMOTE outperforms state-of-the-art oversampling techniques across key metrics including MCC, Balanced Accuracy, and AUPRC.

Conclusion: GK-SMOTE provides a robust, efficient solution for imbalanced classification in noisy environments, making it suitable for real-world applications without extensive parameter tuning.

Abstract: Imbalanced classification is a significant challenge in machine learning,
especially in critical applications like medical diagnosis, fraud detection,
and cybersecurity. Traditional oversampling techniques, such as SMOTE, often
fail to handle label noise and complex data distributions, leading to reduced
classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose GK-SMOTE, a
hyperparameter-free, noise-resilient extension of SMOTE, built on Gaussian
Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). GK-SMOTE enhances class separability by
generating synthetic samples in high-density minority regions, while
effectively avoiding noisy or ambiguous areas. This self-adaptive approach uses
Gaussian KDE to differentiate between safe and noisy regions, ensuring more
accurate sample generation without requiring extensive parameter tuning. Our
extensive experiments on diverse binary classification datasets demonstrate
that GK-SMOTE outperforms existing state-of-the-art oversampling techniques
across key evaluation metrics, including MCC, Balanced Accuracy, and AUPRC. The
proposed method offers a robust, efficient solution for imbalanced
classification tasks, especially in noisy data environments, making it an
attractive choice for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OTA Merging + FFG: Curvature-aware model merging method that uses optimizer statistics and sparsification to effectively combine multiple SFT checkpoints while reducing interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective post-training strategy for composing capabilities from multiple supervised fine-tuning checkpoints without joint retraining, addressing interference issues in model merging.

Method: OTA Merging uses optimizer second-moment statistics as curvature proxy for parameter reweighting. FFG sparsifies conflicting edits with low-rank masks in attention projections and embeddings. Includes memory-light compression of second moments.

Result: Improves merged-model quality over weight-space baselines, reduces negative transfer, robust across sparsity levels. Shows substantial curvature overlap between checkpoints.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware merging with sparsification effectively combines SFT capabilities. Simple linear merging works due to curvature overlap. Method open-sourced for reproducibility.

Abstract: Model merging is an effective post-training strategy for composing
capabilities in large language models without joint retraining. We study this
in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, where multiple capability-based SFT
checkpoints -- spanning math, code, precise instruction following, general
instruction following, and knowledge recall -- must be consolidated into a
single model. We introduce Optimization Trajectory Aware (OTA) Merging, a
curvature-aware aggregation that leverages optimizer second-moment statistics
as a diagonal curvature proxy to reweight parameter edits and mitigate
interference. Complementing OTA, we propose Fast Fisher Grafting (FFG), a
curvature-driven task-localization step that sparsifies conflicting or
low-importance edits. FFG induces extremely low-rank masks concentrated in
early attention query/key projections and token embeddings, exploiting shared
curvature across capabilities. We further develop a memory-light compression of
the second moments that preserves OTA's effect. Across diverse capability-based
SFT checkpoints, OTA+FFG improves merged-model quality over strong weight-space
baselines, reduces negative transfer, and remains robust across sparsity
levels. Analyses reveal substantial curvature overlap between checkpoints,
offering a novel lens on why simple linear merging can be effective in
practice. Ablations confirm that FFG is critical for reducing task interference
and that the compressed second moments retain the gains of the full
formulation. To facilitate reproducibility, we open-source all code, training
and evaluation scripts, visualization artifacts, and capability-specific SFT
checkpoints at https://github.com/pmahdavi/ota-merge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedGDVE enhances federated learning for recommender systems by selectively augmenting local client data with relevant global interactions using graph encoding and reinforcement learning, achieving up to 34.86% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL-based recommender systems underutilize publicly available global data, relying only on private client data despite potential benefits for mitigating sparse and biased local data limitations.

Method: Proposes FedGDVE with: (i) pre-trained graph encoder for global structural features, (ii) local valid predictor for client-specific relevance assessment, (iii) reinforcement-learning-based probability estimator to filter and sample the most pertinent global interactions.

Result: Achieves up to 34.86% performance improvement on recognized benchmarks in federated learning environments.

Conclusion: Selective augmentation of local client data with semantically aligned global samples through FedGDVE effectively addresses the challenges of noise amplification and computational costs while significantly enhancing recommendation performance in federated settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is gaining prominence in machine learning as privacy
concerns grow. This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online
store) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model
updates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby
preserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing
FL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data,
despite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to
enrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this
end, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform
collaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender
system. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item
lists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or
locally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of
sparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional
challenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and
irrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational
costs. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively
augments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the
global dataset. FedGDVE employs: (i) a pre-trained graph encoder to extract
global structural features, (ii) a local valid predictor to assess
client-specific relevance, (iii) a reinforcement-learning-based probability
estimator to filter and sample only the most pertinent global interactions.
FedGDVE improves performance by up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in FL
environments.

*Xi He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces four novel formal definitions for Optimal Decision Tree (ODT) problems and derives optimal algorithms using algebraic programming theory, providing a unified solution that generalizes existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish unambiguous formal specifications for ODT problems and derive correct-by-construction algorithms that can handle arbitrary splitting rules, going beyond traditional axis-parallel constraints.

Method: Uses algebraic programming theory (a relational formalism) to derive dynamic programming solutions from executable recursive program specifications. The approach constructs algorithms for both size-constrained and depth-constrained trees with flexible splitting rules.

Result: Developed four novel optimal algorithms for ODT problems that encompass existing depth-constrained axis-parallel methods as special cases. The framework supports arbitrary splitting rules satisfying specific axioms and objective functions.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified, efficient, and elegant solution for general ODT problems, with demonstrated potential for flexible splitting rules and extensibility to mixed splitting rules and hypersurface decision trees (as covered in Part II).

Abstract: In the first paper (part I) of this series of two, we introduce four novel
definitions of the ODT problems: three for size-constrained trees and one for
depth-constrained trees. These definitions are stated unambiguously through
executable recursive programs, satisfying all criteria we propose for a formal
specification. In this sense, they resemble the "standard form" used in the
study of general-purpose solvers.
  Grounded in algebraic programming theory-a relational formalism for deriving
correct-by-construction algorithms from specifications-we can not only
establish the existence or nonexistence of dynamic programming solutions but
also derive them constructively whenever they exist. Consequently, the four
generic problem definitions yield four novel optimal algorithms for ODT
problems with arbitrary splitting rules that satisfy the axioms and objective
functions of a given form. These algorithms encompass the known
depth-constrained, axis-parallel ODT algorithm as the special case, while
providing a unified, efficient, and elegant solution for the general ODT
problem.
  In Part II, we present the first optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm
and provide comprehensive experiments against axis-parallel decision tree
algorithms, including heuristic CART and state-of-the-art optimal methods. The
results demonstrate the significant potential of decision trees with flexible
splitting rules. Moreover, our framework is readily extendable to support
algorithms for constructing even more flexible decision trees, including those
with mixed splitting rules.

TL;DR: TransZero is a model-based RL algorithm that parallelizes MCTS using transformer networks and MVC evaluator, achieving 11x speedup over MuZero while maintaining sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To remove the sequential bottleneck in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that limits real-time decision-making in complex environments.

Method: Uses transformer-based network to generate multiple latent future states simultaneously instead of step-by-step recurrent dynamics, combined with Mean-Variance Constrained evaluator to eliminate sequential visitation count dependence.

Result: Achieves up to 11x speedup in wall-clock time compared to MuZero while maintaining sample efficiency, as demonstrated in MiniGrid and LunarLander environments.

Conclusion: Parallel tree construction through transformer networks and MVC evaluator can substantially accelerate model-based reinforcement learning, enabling real-time decision-making in complex environments.

Abstract: We present TransZero, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that
removes the sequential bottleneck in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Unlike
MuZero, which constructs its search tree step by step using a recurrent
dynamics model, TransZero employs a transformer-based network to generate
multiple latent future states simultaneously. Combined with the Mean-Variance
Constrained (MVC) evaluator that eliminates dependence on inherently sequential
visitation counts, our approach enables the parallel expansion of entire
subtrees during planning. Experiments in MiniGrid and LunarLander show that
TransZero achieves up to an eleven-fold speedup in wall-clock time compared to
MuZero while maintaining sample efficiency. These results demonstrate that
parallel tree construction can substantially accelerate model-based
reinforcement learning, bringing real-time decision-making in complex
environments closer to practice. The code is publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on Riemannian optimization relied on geodesic convexity, which leads to regret bounds that scale poorly with manifold curvature. This limitation motivates the use of horospherical convexity to achieve better performance.

Method: Riemannian online gradient descent for h-convex and strongly h-convex functions, analyzed on Hadamard manifolds. Experimental validation on symmetric positive definite matrices with affine-invariant metric, including online Tyler's M-estimation and online Fréchet mean computation.

Result: Established O(√T) regret for h-convex functions and O(log(T)) regret for strongly h-convex functions. These bounds are curvature-independent and match Euclidean setting results.

Conclusion: Horospherical convexity provides a superior framework for Riemannian online optimization, enabling curvature-independent regret bounds that achieve performance comparable to Euclidean optimization.

Abstract: We study online Riemannian optimization on Hadamard manifolds under the
framework of horospherical convexity (h-convexity). Prior work mostly relies on
the geodesic convexity (g-convexity), leading to regret bounds scaling poorly
with the manifold curvature. To address this limitation, we analyze Riemannian
online gradient descent for h-convex and strongly h-convex functions and
establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\log(T))$ regret guarantees, respectively. These
bounds are curvature-independent and match the results in the Euclidean
setting. We validate our approach with experiments on the manifold of symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices equipped with the affine-invariant metric. In
particular, we investigate online Tyler's $M$-estimation and online Fr\'echet
mean computation, showing the application of h-convexity in practice.

### [132] [Gradient Free Deep Reinforcement Learning With TabPFN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11259)
*David Schiff,Ofir Lindenbaum,Yonathan Efroni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabPFN RL is a gradient-free deep RL framework that repurposes the meta-trained transformer TabPFN as a Q function approximator, eliminating backpropagation and achieving competitive performance on classic control tasks without extensive hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based optimization in deep RL introduces sensitivity to hyperparameters, unstable training dynamics, and high computational costs. The authors aim to develop a more stable and computationally efficient alternative.

Method: Repurposes TabPFN (a transformer pre-trained on synthetic datasets) as a Q function approximator using in-context learning. Implements a high reward episode gate to retain top 5% trajectories due to fixed context budget, and uses inference-only Q-value prediction without backpropagation.

Result: Empirical evaluations show TabPFN RL matches or surpasses Deep Q Network performance on CartPole v1, MountainCar v0, and Acrobot v1 tasks without gradient descent or extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: TabPFN and similar prior-fitted networks establish a viable foundation for fast and computationally efficient RL, opening new directions for gradient-free RL with large pre-trained transformers.

Abstract: Gradient based optimization is fundamental to most modern deep reinforcement
learning algorithms, however, it introduces significant sensitivity to
hyperparameters, unstable training dynamics, and high computational costs. We
propose TabPFN RL, a novel gradient free deep RL framework that repurposes the
meta trained transformer TabPFN as a Q function approximator. Originally
developed for tabular classification, TabPFN is a transformer pre trained on
millions of synthetic datasets to perform inference on new unseen datasets via
in context learning. Given an in context dataset of sample label pairs and new
unlabeled data, it predicts the most likely labels in a single forward pass,
without gradient updates or task specific fine tuning. We use TabPFN to predict
Q values using inference only, thereby eliminating the need for back
propagation at both training and inference. To cope with the model's fixed
context budget, we design a high reward episode gate that retains only the top
5% of trajectories. Empirical evaluations on the Gymnasium classic control
suite demonstrate that TabPFN RL matches or surpasses Deep Q Network on
CartPole v1, MountainCar v0, and Acrobot v1, without applying gradient descent
or any extensive hyperparameter tuning. We discuss the theoretical aspects of
how bootstrapped targets and non stationary visitation distributions violate
the independence assumptions encoded in TabPFN's prior, yet the model retains a
surprising generalization capacity. We further formalize the intrinsic context
size limit of in context RL algorithms and propose principled truncation
strategies that enable continual learning when the context is full. Our results
establish prior fitted networks such as TabPFN as a viable foundation for fast
and computationally efficient RL, opening new directions for gradient free RL
with large pre trained transformers.

*Qiuhao Liu,Ling Li,Yao Lu,Qi Xuan,Zhaowei Zhu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SelectMix is a confidence-guided Mixup framework that selectively blends uncertain samples with confident peers using soft labels to handle noisy labels and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks memorize noisy labels, degrading generalization. Existing Mixup methods lack principled guidance on sample selection and mixing, propagating noise.

Method: Uses K-fold cross-validation for confidence-based mismatch analysis to identify noisy/ambiguous samples. Selectively blends uncertain samples with confident peers from potential classes. Employs soft labels representing the composition of mixed samples.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on multiple synthetic (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and real-world (CIFAR-N, MNIST, Clothing1M) benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SelectMix effectively addresses noisy label learning through principled sample selection and mixing with soft labels, demonstrating consistent performance improvement and robustness.

Abstract: Deep neural networks tend to memorize noisy labels, severely degrading their
generalization performance. Although Mixup has demonstrated effectiveness in
improving generalization and robustness, existing Mixup-based methods typically
perform indiscriminate mixing without principled guidance on sample selection
and mixing strategy, inadvertently propagating noisy supervision. To overcome
these limitations, we propose SelectMix, a confidence-guided mixing framework
explicitly tailored for noisy labels. SelectMix first identifies potentially
noisy or ambiguous samples through confidence based mismatch analysis using
K-fold cross-validation, then selectively blends identified uncertain samples
with confidently predicted peers from their potential classes. Furthermore,
SelectMix employs soft labels derived from all classes involved in the mixing
process, ensuring the labels accurately represent the composition of the mixed
samples, thus aligning supervision signals closely with the actual mixed
inputs. Through extensive theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on
multiple synthetic (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and real-world
benchmark datasets (CIFAR-N, MNIST and Clothing1M), we demonstrate that
SelectMix consistently outperforms strong baseline methods, validating its
effectiveness and robustness in learning with noisy labels.

*Achmad Ardani Prasha,Clavino Ourizqi Rachmadi,Muhamad Fauzan Ibnu Syahlan,Naufal Rahfi Anugerah,Nanda Garin Raditya,Putri Amelia,Sabrina Laila Mutiara,Hilman Syachr Ramadhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINGS is a physics-informed neural network framework that enables single-step generative sampling (NFE=1) by approximating reverse-time probability-flow dynamics, achieving constant-time generation while preserving target distribution structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of iterative sampling methods in diffusion models by developing a fast, single-pass generative sampling approach that maintains distributional accuracy.

Method: Trains a physics-informed neural network to approximate reverse-time probability-flow dynamics, creating a direct map from standard normal distribution to target distribution with endpoint anchoring and residual problem formulation.

Result: Achieves NFE=1 sampling with 10^4 samples in 16.54ms, preserves target distribution structure (MMD^2 = 1.88e-2), and outperforms DPM-Solver and DDIM by significant margins in speed while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: PINGS provides a promising white-box, differentiable approach for fast generative sampling with potential applications in scientific simulation, offering constant-time generation with single forward pass efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce PINGS (Physics-Informed Neural Network for Fast Generative
Sampling), a framework that amortizes diffusion sampling by training a
physics-informed network to approximate reverse-time probability-flow dynamics,
reducing sampling to a single forward pass (NFE = 1). As a proof of concept, we
learn a direct map from a 3D standard normal to a non-Gaussian Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM). PINGS preserves the target's distributional structure
(multi-bandwidth kernel $MMD^2 = 1.88 \times 10^{-2}$ with small errors in
mean, covariance, skewness, and excess kurtosis) and achieves constant-time
generation: $10^4$ samples in $16.54 \pm 0.56$ millisecond on an RTX 3090,
versus 468-843 millisecond for DPM-Solver (10/20) and 960 millisecond for DDIM
(50) under matched conditions. We also sanity-check the
PINN/automatic-differentiation pipeline on a damped harmonic oscillator,
obtaining MSEs down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. Compared to fast but iterative
ODE solvers and direct-map families (Flow, Rectified-Flow, Consistency), PINGS
frames generative sampling as a PINN-style residual problem with endpoint
anchoring, yielding a white-box, differentiable map with NFE = 1. These
proof-of-concept results position PINGS as a promising route to fast,
function-based generative sampling with potential extensions to scientific
simulation (e.g., fast calorimetry).

*Alejandro Dopico-Castro,Oscar Fontenla-Romero,Bertha Guijarro-Berdiñas,Amparo Alonso-Betanzos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIFNet is a novel Class Incremental Learning method that combines frozen pre-trained feature extractor, compressed data buffer, and one-layer neural network to achieve efficient learning without catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning while reducing computational complexity and resource requirements, especially for resource-limited settings.

Method: Uses pre-trained frozen feature extractor to avoid backbone fine-tuning, compressed data buffer for memory efficiency, and non-iterative one-layer neural network for classification with single-step optimization.

Result: Achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving training efficiency and reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: CIFNet provides an efficient and sustainable solution for class-incremental learning, making it more accessible for resource-constrained environments when pre-trained feature extractors are available.

Abstract: Incremental learning remains a critical challenge in machine learning, as
models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting -the tendency to lose
previously acquired knowledge when learning new information. These challenges
are even more pronounced in resource-limited settings. Many existing Class
Incremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually
adapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial
computational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work
introduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach
that addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable
solution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several
existing, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature
extractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer
neural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor
eliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This,
combined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to
perform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization
process on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time
without requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets
confirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the
classifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing
state-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and
sustainability. CIFNet represents a significant advancement in making
class-incremental learning more accessible and pragmatic in environments with
limited resources, especially when strong pre-trained feature extractors are
available.

*Madhava Gaikwad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Opal presents an operator view of RLHF with objectives as ladders of additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights, showing reducibility under specific conditions and introducing GKPO as a canonical schema for RLHF methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified framework for understanding and comparing different RLHF methods by expressing objectives through mathematical operators and establishing conditions for reducibility.

Method: Defines objectives as ladders of two primitives (additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights), establishes reduction laws with specific conditions, and introduces GKPO schema with JSON serialization and canonicalization rules.

Result: Demonstrates that RLHF objectives collapse to normal form under certain conditions, provides examples of non-reducibility when assumptions fail, and shows cross-method conversions between DPO, RRHF, and ORPO.

Conclusion: GKPO provides a standardized framework for representing RLHF methods, enabling better comparison, conversion between methods, and identification of when reduction assumptions break down.

Abstract: We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a
base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We
describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders
collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed,
penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins.
When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates,
score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility.
  Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference
Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and,
when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization,
canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses
when assumptions fail.
  We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along
with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress
tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python
reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and
adapters for DPO and RRHF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have shown strong potential in scientific research but their capabilities in specialized materials characterization haven't been systematically validated.

Method: Created multi-modal benchmark dataset with hybrid LLM-human approach for question-answer pairs, including multiple-choice and subjective questions across 10 characterization methods.

Result: Advanced multi-modal AI models (GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, Doubao Vision Pro 32K) achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective materials data interpretation tasks.

Conclusion: AI models demonstrate strong potential for materials characterization applications, and the MatQnA dataset is publicly available to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs
in general domains such as programming and writing, and have demonstrated
strong potential in various scientific research scenarios. However, the
capabilities of AI models in the highly specialized field of materials
characterization and analysis have not yet been systematically or sufficiently
validated. To address this gap, we present MatQnA, the first multi-modal
benchmark dataset specifically designed for material characterization
techniques. MatQnA includes ten mainstream characterization methods, such as
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), etc. We
employ a hybrid approach combining LLMs with human-in-the-loop validation to
construct high-quality question-answer pairs, integrating both multiple-choice
and subjective questions. Our preliminary evaluation results show that the most
advanced multi-modal AI models (e.g., GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and Doubao
Vision Pro 32K) have already achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective
questions in materials data interpretation and analysis tasks, demonstrating
strong potential for applications in materials characterization and analysis.

*Ying Cao,Kun Yuan,Ali H. Sayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decentralized adversarial training algorithms escape local minima faster than centralized approaches when perturbation bounds are small and batch sizes are large, leading to flatter minima and improved model robustness in distributed multi-agent environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare distributed adversarial training algorithms and understand how different strategies (centralized vs decentralized) affect model robustness through their ability to escape local minima and find flatter solutions.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework to analyze escaping efficiency from local minima, compared centralized and decentralized strategies (consensus and diffusion), and conducted simulations to validate theoretical findings.

Result: Decentralized algorithms escape local minima faster than centralized approaches when perturbation bounds are small and batch sizes are large, but this advantage diminishes as perturbation bounds increase.

Conclusion: Decentralized adversarial training strategies show potential for enhancing model robustness in distributed settings, particularly under mild attack conditions with appropriate batch sizes.

Abstract: Adversarial training has been widely studied in recent years due to its role
in improving model robustness against adversarial attacks. This paper focuses
on comparing different distributed adversarial training algorithms--including
centralized and decentralized strategies--within multi-agent learning
environments. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of model
flatness in determining robustness. To this end, we develop a general
theoretical framework to study the escaping efficiency of these algorithms from
local minima, which is closely related to the flatness of the resulting models.
We show that when the perturbation bound is sufficiently small (i.e., when the
attack strength is relatively mild) and a large batch size is used,
decentralized adversarial training algorithms--including consensus and
diffusion--are guaranteed to escape faster from local minima than the
centralized strategy, thereby favoring flatter minima. However, as the
perturbation bound increases, this trend may no longer hold. In the simulation
results, we illustrate our theoretical findings and systematically compare the
performance of models obtained through decentralized and centralized
adversarial training algorithms. The results highlight the potential of
decentralized strategies to enhance the robustness of models in distributed
settings.

TL;DR: BiLSTM-VHP is a lightweight bidirectional LSTM model that accurately predicts virus hosts from 400-base nucleotide sequences, achieving 89.62% accuracy for orthohantavirus, 96.58% for rotavirus A, and 77.22% for rabies lyssavirus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zoonotic diseases from animals can spread to humans and cause outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2, Monkeypox, and swine flu. Fast and accurate host prediction from viral sequences can help prevent disease spread.

Method: Proposed BiLSTM-VHP architecture using bidirectional long short-term memory networks to analyze 400-base nucleotide sequences. Created three curated datasets with 8,575, 95,197, and 22,052 sequences divided into 9, 12, and 29 host classes respectively.

Result: Achieved high prediction accuracy: 89.62% for orthohantavirus, 96.58% for rotavirus A, and 77.22% for rabies lyssavirus, outperforming previous studies. Performance assessed using confusion matrix, F-1 score, precision, recall, and microaverage AUC.

Conclusion: The BiLSTM-VHP model provides an effective lightweight solution for predicting virus hosts from nucleotide sequences, which can help in early detection and prevention of zoonotic disease outbreaks.

Abstract: Recorded history shows the long coexistence of humans and animals, suggesting
it began much earlier. Despite some beneficial interdependence, many animals
carry viral diseases that can spread to humans. These diseases are known as
zoonotic diseases. Recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, Monkeypox and swine flu
viruses have shown how these viruses can disrupt human life and cause death.
Fast and accurate predictions of the host from which the virus spreads can help
prevent these diseases from spreading. This work presents BiLSTM-VHP, a
lightweight bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM)-based architecture that
can predict the host from the nucleotide sequence of orthohantavirus, rabies
lyssavirus, and rotavirus A with high accuracy. The proposed model works with
nucleotide sequences of 400 bases in length and achieved a prediction accuracy
of 89.62% for orthohantavirus, 96.58% for rotavirus A, and 77.22% for rabies
lyssavirus outperforming previous studies. Moreover, performance of the model
is assessed using the confusion matrix, F-1 score, precision, recall,
microaverage AUC. In addition, we introduce three curated datasets of
orthohantavirus, rotavirus A, and rabies lyssavirus containing 8,575, 95,197,

TL;DR: This paper investigates Linear Mode Connectivity in Mixture-of-Experts architectures, showing that independently trained MoE models can be connected by linear paths with low loss after proper permutation alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of Linear Mode Connectivity from standard neural networks to Mixture-of-Experts architectures, which have different symmetries and structural properties due to their expert components and gating mechanisms.

Method: Conducted comprehensive analysis of dense and sparse gating regimes, characterized MoE symmetries, developed a matching algorithm for expert alignment, and empirically validated LMC across diverse MoE configurations and datasets.

Result: Successfully demonstrated the existence of Linear Mode Connectivity in MoE architectures, confirming that independently trained MoE models can be connected by linear paths with consistently low loss after proper permutation matching.

Conclusion: The study confirms LMC in MoE architectures and provides fundamental insights into the functional landscape and optimization dynamics of deep learning models, with implications for model ensembling and generalization.

Abstract: Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) is a notable phenomenon in the loss landscapes
of neural networks, wherein independently trained models have been observed to
be connected--up to permutation symmetries--by linear paths in parameter space
along which the loss remains consistently low. This observation challenges
classical views of non-convex optimization and has implications for model
ensembling, generalization, and our understanding of neural loss geometry.
Inspired by recent studies on LMC in standard neural networks, we
systematically investigate this phenomenon within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures--a class of models known for their scalability and computational
efficiency, which combine traditional neural networks--referred to as
experts--through a learnable gating mechanism. We begin by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of both dense and sparse gating regimes, demonstrating
that the symmetries inherent to MoE architectures are fully characterized by
permutations acting on both the expert components and the gating function.
Building on these foundational findings, we propose a matching algorithm that
enables alignment between independently trained MoEs, thereby facilitating the
discovery of LMC. Finally, we empirically validate the presence of LMC using
our proposed algorithm across diverse MoE configurations--including dense,
sparse, and shared-expert variants--under a wide range of model settings and
datasets of varying scales and modalities. Our results confirm the existence of
LMC in MoE architectures and offer fundamental insights into the functional
landscape and optimization dynamics of deep learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce and study the problem of online omniprediction with long-term
constraints. At each round, a forecaster is tasked with generating predictions
for an underlying (adaptively, adversarially chosen) state that are broadcast
to a collection of downstream agents, who must each choose an action. Each of
the downstream agents has both a utility function mapping actions and state to
utilities, and a vector-valued constraint function mapping actions and states
to vector-valued costs. The utility and constraint functions can arbitrarily
differ across downstream agents. Their goal is to choose actions that guarantee
themselves no regret while simultaneously guaranteeing that they do not
cumulatively violate the constraints across time. We show how to make a single
set of predictions so that each of the downstream agents can guarantee this by
acting as a simple function of the predictions, guaranteeing each of them
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $O(1)$ cumulative constraint violation. We
also show how to extend our guarantees to arbitrary intersecting contextually
defined \emph{subsequences}, guaranteeing each agent both regret and constraint
violation bounds not just marginally, but simultaneously on each subsequence,
against a benchmark set of actions simultaneously tailored to each subsequence.

TL;DR: PersonaX is a multimodal dataset collection combining behavioral traits inferred by LLMs with facial imagery and biographical data for comprehensive analysis of public figures across different occupations and sports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack integration of behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities like facial attributes and biographical information, limiting comprehensive analysis of human behavior traits.

Method: Created two datasets (CelebPersona and AthlePersona) with behavioral trait assessments from three LLMs, facial imagery, and biographical features. Applied statistical independence tests and introduced a novel causal representation learning framework with theoretical identifiability guarantees.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach in analyzing relationships between behavioral traits and other modalities.

Conclusion: PersonaX provides a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in
human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI
systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to
capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely
provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary
modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address
this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets
designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities.
PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from
diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes
across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait
assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside
facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two
complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text
descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their
relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal
representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and
multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX
establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in
conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait
analysis and causal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL applications like healthcare, robotics, and finance face non-stationary environments where transition probabilities or reward functions evolve over time, causing model drift that standard RL agents don't handle.

Method: Introduces a suite of edit operation-based measures to quantify deviations between state-action trajectories generated under stationary vs. perturbed conditions.

Result: Experiments show these measures effectively distinguish drifted from non-drifted scenarios, even under varying noise levels.

Conclusion: Provides a practical tool for drift detection in non-stationary RL environments through trajectory distribution analysis.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically assume stationary environment
dynamics. Yet in real-world applications such as healthcare, robotics, and
finance, transition probabilities or reward functions may evolve, leading to
model drift. This paper proposes a novel framework to detect such drifts by
analyzing the distributional changes in sequences of agent behavior.
Specifically, we introduce a suite of edit operation-based measures to quantify
deviations between state-action trajectories generated under stationary and
perturbed conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that these measures can
effectively distinguish drifted from non-drifted scenarios, even under varying
levels of noise, providing a practical tool for drift detection in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of representing musical data for AI analysis and develop a method to distinguish between human-composed and AI-generated music, particularly identifying different AI generation techniques.

Method: Developed YNote music notation system, framed as text classification problem, applied TF-IDF for feature extraction from YNote sequences, used SMOTE for data imbalance handling.

Result: Achieved 98.25% classification accuracy, successfully demonstrating YNote retains sufficient stylistic information and can identify unique technological fingerprints of different AI generation methods.

Conclusion: YNote provides an effective representation for musical data analysis and enables tracing origins of AI-generated content through identifiable technological fingerprints.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI-driven music
generation has become a vibrant and fruitful area of research. However, the
representation of musical data remains a significant challenge. To address
this, a novel, machine-learning-friendly music notation system, YNote, was
developed. This study leverages YNote to train an effective classification
model capable of distinguishing whether a piece of music was composed by a
human (Native), a rule-based algorithm (Algorithm Generated), or an LLM (LLM

*Sagi Schwartz,Qinling Wang,Fang Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid approach using XAI for feature selection to create transparent glass-box models that maintain predictive performance while meeting regulatory requirements for credit default prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models outperform traditional methods but lack transparency needed for regulated environments like banking. Current XAI focuses on post-hoc interpretation which doesn't produce sufficiently transparent models for regulatory compliance.

Method: Post-hoc interpretations (SHAP) of black-box models (XGBoost) guide feature selection, followed by training glass-box models (EBM and PLTR) that maintain both predictive power and transparency.

Result: Achieved performance comparable to benchmark black-box model while using only 10 features (88.5% reduction). Model refinement through feature interaction analysis, correlation checks, and expert input further enhanced interpretability and robustness.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully bridges the gap between predictive performance and regulatory transparency requirements, demonstrating that glass-box models can achieve similar performance to black-box models while being interpretable enough for regulated environments.

Abstract: Predicting default is essential for banks to ensure profitability and
financial stability. While modern machine learning methods often outperform
traditional regression techniques, their lack of transparency limits their use
in regulated environments. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
emerged as a solution in domains like credit scoring. However, most XAI
research focuses on post-hoc interpretation of black-box models, which does not
produce models lightweight or transparent enough to meet regulatory
requirements, such as those for Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) models.
  This paper proposes a hybrid approach: post-hoc interpretations of black-box
models guide feature selection, followed by training glass-box models that
maintain both predictive power and transparency.
  Using the Lending Club dataset, we demonstrate that this approach achieves
performance comparable to a benchmark black-box model while using only 10
features - an 88.5% reduction. In our example, SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP) is used for feature selection, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
serves as the benchmark and the base black-box model, and Explainable Boosting
Machine (EBM) and Penalized Logistic Tree Regression (PLTR) are the
investigated glass-box models.
  We also show that model refinement using feature interaction analysis,
correlation checks, and expert input can further enhance model interpretability
and robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI red-teaming should be viewed as a domain-specific evolution of cyber red-teaming, where merging AI and Cyber Red Teams creates a robust security ecosystem to address AI system vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As enterprise systems increasingly adopt AI, red-teaming needs to evolve to address unique AI vulnerabilities and risks that traditional cyber red-teaming doesn't cover.

Method: Proposes framing AI red-teaming as an evolution of cyber red-teaming, allowing Cyber Red Teams to better evaluate AI systems by recognizing new risks and failure modes, while enabling AI Red Teams to leverage established cybersecurity structures and practices.

Result: The integration creates mutual benefits - Cyber Red Teams gain AI-specific expertise while AI Red Teams adopt proven cybersecurity frameworks, rules of engagement, and mature tooling patterns.

Conclusion: Merging AI and Cyber Red Teams positions the community to better adapt to rapidly changing threats by creating a comprehensive security ecosystem that addresses both traditional cyber and emerging AI vulnerabilities.

Abstract: A red team simulates adversary attacks to help defenders find effective
strategies to defend their systems in a real-world operational setting. As more
enterprise systems adopt AI, red-teaming will need to evolve to address the
unique vulnerabilities and risks posed by AI systems. We take the position that
AI systems can be more effectively red-teamed if AI red-teaming is recognized
as a domain-specific evolution of cyber red-teaming. Specifically, we argue
that existing Cyber Red Teams who adopt this framing will be able to better
evaluate systems with AI components by recognizing that AI poses new risks, has
new failure modes to exploit, and often contains unpatchable bugs that
re-prioritize disclosure and mitigation strategies. Similarly, adopting a
cybersecurity framing will allow existing AI Red Teams to leverage a
well-tested structure to emulate realistic adversaries, promote mutual
accountability with formal rules of engagement, and provide a pattern to mature
the tooling necessary for repeatable, scalable engagements. In these ways, the
merging of AI and Cyber Red Teams will create a robust security ecosystem and
best position the community to adapt to the rapidly changing threat landscape.

Abstract: Existing AI system benchmarks such as MLPerf often struggle to keep pace with
the rapidly evolving AI landscape, making it difficult to support informed
deployment, optimization, and co-design decisions for AI systems. We suggest
that benchmarking itself can be framed as an AI task - one in which models are
continuously evaluated and optimized across diverse datasets, software, and
hardware, using key metrics such as accuracy, latency, throughput, energy
consumption, and cost. To support this perspective, we present FlexBench: a
modular extension of the MLPerf LLM inference benchmark, integrated with
HuggingFace and designed to provide relevant and actionable insights.
Benchmarking results and metadata are collected into an Open MLPerf Dataset,
which can be collaboratively curated, extended, and leveraged for predictive
modeling and feature engineering. We successfully validated the FlexBench
concept through MLPerf Inference submissions, including evaluations of DeepSeek
R1 and LLaMA 3.3 on commodity servers. The broader objective is to enable
practitioners to make cost-effective AI deployment decisions that reflect their

*Qiyang Han*

TL;DR: This paper develops a general framework to analyze nonconvex gradient descent in generalized single-index models with large aspect ratios, showing that iterates concentrate around deterministic vectors tracked by state evolution equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the long-time trajectory behavior of nonconvex gradient descent in generalized single-index models and understand the implicit regularization effects in large aspect ratio regimes.

Method: Develops a general approach using state evolution systems of two recursive equations to track the dynamics of gradient descent iterates, which concentrate around deterministic vectors called 'Gaussian theoretical gradient descent'.

Result: Proves universal concentration guarantees for broad classes of design matrices over long time horizons, reveals implicit regularization effects, and demonstrates applications including global convergence proofs and data-free parameter estimation algorithms.

Conclusion: The approach provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding gradient descent dynamics in nonconvex settings, with practical applications for hyperparameter tuning and runtime determination through data-free state evolution estimation.

Abstract: This paper develops a general approach to characterize the long-time
trajectory behavior of nonconvex gradient descent in generalized single-index
models in the large aspect ratio regime. In this regime, we show that for each
iteration the gradient descent iterate concentrates around a deterministic
vector called the `Gaussian theoretical gradient descent', whose dynamics can
be tracked by a state evolution system of two recursive equations for two
scalars. Our concentration guarantees hold universally for a broad class of
design matrices and remain valid over long time horizons until algorithmic
convergence or divergence occurs. Moreover, our approach reveals that gradient
descent iterates are in general approximately independent of the data and
strongly incoherent with the feature vectors, a phenomenon previously known as
the `implicit regularization' effect of gradient descent in specific models
under Gaussian data.
  As an illustration of the utility of our general theory, we present two
applications of different natures in the regression setting. In the first, we
prove global convergence of nonconvex gradient descent with general independent
initialization for a broad class of structured link functions, and establish
universality of randomly initialized gradient descent in phase retrieval for
large aspect ratios. In the second, we develop a data-free iterative algorithm
for estimating state evolution parameters along the entire gradient descent
trajectory, thereby providing a low-cost yet statistically valid tool for
practical tasks such as hyperparameter tuning and runtime determination.
  As a by-product of our analysis, we show that in the large aspect ratio
regime, the Gaussian theoretical gradient descent coincides with a recent line
of dynamical mean-field theory for gradient descent over the constant-time
horizon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve crash severity prediction in electric vehicle collisions using advanced deep tabular learning methods to enable better safety interventions.

Method: Analyzed 23,301 EV crash records, used XGBoost/Random Forest for feature importance, applied SMOTEENN resampling for class imbalance, and benchmarked three deep tabular models (TabPFN, MambaNet, MambaAttention).

Result: TabPFN showed strong generalization, but MambaAttention achieved superior performance in classifying severe injury cases due to its attention-based feature reweighting capability.

Conclusion: Deep tabular architectures show significant potential for improving EV crash severity prediction and enabling data-driven safety interventions in electric vehicle crash contexts.

Abstract: This study presents a deep tabular learning framework for predicting crash
severity in electric vehicle (EV) collisions using real-world crash data from
Texas (2017-2023). After filtering for electric-only vehicles, 23,301
EV-involved crash records were analyzed. Feature importance techniques using
XGBoost and Random Forest identified intersection relation, first harmful
event, person age, crash speed limit, and day of week as the top predictors,
along with advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking. To
address class imbalance, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Edited
Nearest Neighbors (SMOTEENN) resampling was applied. Three state-of-the-art
deep tabular models, TabPFN, MambaNet, and MambaAttention, were benchmarked for
severity prediction. While TabPFN demonstrated strong generalization,
MambaAttention achieved superior performance in classifying severe injury cases
due to its attention-based feature reweighting. The findings highlight the
potential of deep tabular architectures for improving crash severity prediction
and enabling data-driven safety interventions in EV crash contexts.

*Yining Lu,Zilong Wang,Shiyang Li,Xin Liu,Changlong Yu,Qingyu Yin,Zhan Shi,Zixuan Zhang,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic reward weighting for multi-objective RL that adaptively adjusts weights during training to handle non-convex Pareto fronts in LLM preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-weight linear scalarization fails to capture non-convex Pareto fronts in multi-objective RL, especially critical for online preference alignment in LLMs where stochastic trajectories create highly non-linear mappings.

Method: Two approaches: (1) hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight optimization, both dynamically adjusting reward weights during online RL training.

Result: Achieves Pareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight baselines, compatible with GRPO, REINFORCE, RLOO algorithms, effective across multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and model families.

Conclusion: Dynamic reward weighting enables effective exploration of Pareto fronts and provides a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective alignment in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Prior works in multi-objective reinforcement learning typically use linear
reward scalarization with fixed weights, which provably fail to capture
non-convex Pareto fronts and thus yield suboptimal results. This limitation
becomes especially critical in online preference alignment for large language
models. Here, stochastic trajectories generated by parameterized policies
create highly non-linear and non-convex mappings from parameters to objectives
that no single static weighting scheme can find optimal trade-offs. We address
this limitation by introducing dynamic reward weighting, which adaptively
adjusts reward weights during the online reinforcement learning process. Unlike
existing approaches that rely on fixed-weight interpolation, our dynamic
weighting continuously balances and prioritizes objectives in training,
facilitating effective exploration of Pareto fronts in objective space. We
introduce two approaches of increasing sophistication and generalizability: (1)
hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight
optimization, offering a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective
alignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate their compatibility with
commonly used online reinforcement learning algorithms (including GRPO,
REINFORCE, and RLOO), effectiveness across multiple mathematical reasoning
datasets, and applicability to different model families, consistently achieving
Pareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight linear
scalarization baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug repurposing is economically challenging, and existing studies rely on simplified datasets with known drug-disease similarities. The goal is to identify new drug-disease links across unrelated disease domains using advanced machine learning techniques.

Method: Unsupervised deep embedded clustering using autoencoders to compress multi-omic data into latent embeddings, followed by supervised graph neural network link prediction. 9,022 drugs were partitioned into 35 clusters, and GNNs were used for link prediction.

Result: Achieved mean silhouette score of 0.8550 for clustering, and GNNs showed strong performance: accuracy 0.901, ROC AUC 0.960, F1-Score 0.901. Generated 477 high-confidence drug-disease links with probabilities exceeding 99%.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully identifies novel drug-disease connections and advances machine learning applications in drug repurposing, potentially providing new therapeutic prospects across diverse disease domains.

Abstract: Drug repurposing has historically been an economically infeasible process for
identifying novel uses for abandoned drugs. Modern machine learning has enabled
the identification of complex biochemical intricacies in candidate drugs;
however, many studies rely on simplified datasets with known drug-disease
similarities. We propose a machine learning pipeline that uses unsupervised
deep embedded clustering, combined with supervised graph neural network link
prediction to identify new drug-disease links from multi-omic data.
Unsupervised autoencoder and cluster training reduced the dimensionality of
omic data into a compressed latent embedding. A total of 9,022 unique drugs
were partitioned into 35 clusters with a mean silhouette score of 0.8550. Graph
neural networks achieved strong statistical performance, with a prediction
accuracy of 0.901, receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of
0.960, and F1-Score of 0.901. A ranked list comprised of 477 per-cluster link
probabilities exceeding 99 percent was generated. This study could provide new
drug-disease link prospects across unrelated disease domains, while advancing
the understanding of machine learning in drug repurposing studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEED combines Early Exit DNNs with Selective Prediction using Deferral Classifiers to improve both inference latency and trustworthiness by detecting hard samples early and deferring them to experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Neural Networks suffer from inference latency and overconfidence issues in critical applications. Early Exit strategies reduce latency but can be untrustworthy due to overconfidence leading to premature exits.

Method: Proposes SPEED approach that uses Deferral Classifiers at each layer to check sample hardness before performing early exits. Hard samples are deferred to experts rather than exiting early.

Result: Reduces wrong prediction risk by 50% with 2.05x speedup compared to final layer inference. Improves both accuracy and latency simultaneously.

Conclusion: Combining Early Exit with Selective Prediction through Deferral Classifiers effectively addresses both latency and trustworthiness issues in DNN deployment for critical applications.

Abstract: Inference latency and trustworthiness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the
bottlenecks in deploying them in critical applications like sensitive tasks.
Early Exit (EE) DNNs overcome the latency issues by allowing samples to exit
from intermediary layers if they attain `high' confidence scores on the
predicted class. However, the DNNs are known to exhibit overconfidence, which
can lead to many samples exiting early and render EE strategies untrustworthy.
We use Selective Prediction (SP) to overcome this issue by checking the
`hardness' of the samples rather than just relying on the confidence score
alone. We propose SPEED, a novel approach that uses Deferral Classifiers (DCs)
at each layer to check the hardness of samples before performing EEs.
Specifically, the DCs identify if a sample is hard to predict at an
intermediary layer, leading to hallucination, and defer it to an expert. Early
detection of hard samples for inference prevents the wastage of computational
resources and improves trust by deferring the hard samples to the expert. We
demonstrate that EE aided with SP improves both accuracy and latency. Our
method minimizes the risk of wrong prediction by $50\%$ with a speedup of
$2.05\times$ as compared to the final layer. The anonymized source code is

TL;DR: Semi-online RL bridges offline and online RL for GUI agents by simulating online training on offline data with adaptive trajectory recovery and multi-level advantage optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agent approaches face a dilemma: offline RL lacks trajectory-level rewards while online RL suffers from sparse rewards and high deployment costs.

Method: Simulates online RL on offline trajectories using a Patch Module to recover divergence between rollout and expert trajectories, with discounted future returns and weighted step/episode-level advantages.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four benchmarks (+12.0% on AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), bridging offline training efficiency and online reasoning.

Conclusion: Semi-online RL effectively addresses the offline-online RL dilemma for GUI agents, demonstrating significant performance improvements and practical evaluation through SOP metric.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress
in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement
learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL
enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with
multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online
RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from
sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present
Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL
on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original
model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively
recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture
long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns
into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level
and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance
(SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a
practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that
ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four
dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on
AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging
the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

TL;DR: DAPNet is a Mixture-of-Experts framework that integrates temporal periodicity analysis, dynamic cross-variable correlation modeling, and hybrid feature extraction to overcome limitations of existing methods in network state classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for network state classification struggle to capture both temporal patterns and variable dependencies simultaneously - temporal-focused methods overlook dependencies while dependency-focused methods miss fine-grained temporal details.

Method: DAPNet uses a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with three specialized networks: periodic analysis expert, dynamic correlation expert, and hybrid temporal expert. A learnable gating network dynamically weights expert outputs, and a hybrid regularization loss addresses class imbalance.

Result: Extensive experiments on CICIDS2017/2018 datasets show higher accuracy for network intrusion detection. Evaluation on ten UEA benchmark datasets demonstrates the framework's generalizability.

Conclusion: DAPNet effectively addresses the trade-off between temporal pattern capture and variable dependency modeling, providing a specialized and generalizable framework for network state classification with improved performance.

Abstract: Effective network state classification is a primary task for ensuring network
security and optimizing performance. Existing deep learning models have shown
considerable progress in this area. Some methods excel at analyzing the complex
temporal periodicities found in traffic data, while graph-based approaches are
adept at modeling the dynamic dependencies between different variables.
However, a key trade-off remains, as these methods struggle to capture both
characteristics simultaneously. Models focused on temporal patterns often
overlook crucial variable dependencies, whereas those centered on dependencies
may fail to capture fine-grained temporal details. To address this trade-off,
we introduce DAPNet, a framework based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture.
DAPNet integrates three specialized networks for periodic analysis, dynamic
cross-variable correlation modeling, and hybrid temporal feature extraction. A
learnable gating network dynamically assigns weights to experts based on the
input sample and computes a weighted fusion of their outputs. Furthermore, a
hybrid regularization loss function ensures stable training and addresses the
common issue of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on two large-scale
network intrusion detection datasets (CICIDS2017/2018) validate DAPNet's higher
accuracy for its target application. The generalizability of the architectural
design is evaluated across ten public UEA benchmark datasets, positioning
DAPNet as a specialized framework for network state classification.

TL;DR: DARD method distills adversarial robustness from large teacher models to compact student models, outperforming standard adversarial training with better robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and while adversarial training improves robustness, it degrades performance on natural data. Larger models show better robustness, so this work aims to transfer that robustness to smaller models.

Method: Proposed Dice Adversarial Robustness Distillation (DARD) - a knowledge distillation paradigm to transfer robustness from large teacher models to compact student models. Also introduced Dice Projected Gradient Descent (DPGD) for effective adversarial attack generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show DARD consistently outperforms adversarially trained networks with the same architecture, achieving superior robustness and standard accuracy.

Conclusion: Robustness can be systematically distilled from large teacher models to compact student models through the proposed DARD approach, providing better performance than traditional adversarial training methods.

Abstract: Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing critical
security challenges in real-world applications. While Adversarial Training (AT
) is a widely adopted defense mechanism to enhance robustness, it often incurs
a trade-off by degrading performance on unperturbed, natural data. Recent
efforts have highlighted that larger models exhibit enhanced robustness over
their smaller counterparts. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that such
robustness can be systematically distilled from large teacher models into
compact student models. To achieve better performance, we introduce Dice
Adversarial Robustness Distillation (DARD), a novel method designed to transfer
robustness through a tailored knowledge distillation paradigm. Additionally, we
propose Dice Projected Gradient Descent (DPGD), an adversarial example
generalization method optimized for effective attack. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that the DARD approach consistently outperforms adversarially
trained networks with the same architecture, achieving superior robustness and
standard accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unlearning fails to protect against test-time privacy threats where adversaries exploit confident predictions on unlearned data. The paper introduces a weight perturbation algorithm that maximizes uncertainty on protected instances while maintaining accuracy on others, with proven privacy-utility tradeoff bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning methods leave models vulnerable to test-time privacy attacks where adversaries can exploit confident predictions on unlearned data, potentially harming users even after data removal.

Method: Developed a finetuning algorithm with Pareto optimal objective that perturbs model weights to induce maximal uncertainty on protected instances while preserving utility. Also provided a certifiable approximation algorithm with (ε, δ) guarantees without convexity assumptions.

Result: Empirical results show >3× stronger uncertainty than pretraining with <0.2% accuracy drops on various image recognition benchmarks. Proved tight, non-vacuous bounds characterizing the privacy-utility tradeoff.

Conclusion: The framework provides effective protection against test-time privacy threats, offering certified guarantees and practical utility preservation, making it a valuable tool for end-user protection in machine learning systems.

Abstract: Unlearning is the predominant method for removing the influence of data in
machine learning models. However, even after unlearning, models often continue
to produce the same predictions on the unlearned data with high confidence.
This persistent behavior can be exploited by adversaries using confident model
predictions on incorrect or obsolete data to harm users. We call this threat
model, which unlearning fails to protect against, *test-time privacy*. In
particular, an adversary with full model access can bypass any naive defenses
which ensure test-time privacy. To address this threat, we introduce an
algorithm which perturbs model weights to induce maximal uncertainty on
protected instances while preserving accuracy on the rest of the instances. Our
core algorithm is based on finetuning with a Pareto optimal objective that
explicitly balances test-time privacy against utility. We also provide a
certifiable approximation algorithm which achieves $(\varepsilon, \delta)$
guarantees without convexity assumptions. We then prove a tight, non-vacuous
bound that characterizes the privacy-utility tradeoff that our algorithms
incur. Empirically, our method obtains $>3\times$ stronger uncertainty than
pretraining with $<0.2\%$ drops in accuracy on various image recognition
benchmarks. Altogether, this framework provides a tool to guarantee additional
protection to end users.

### [160] [SpeCa: Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Speculative Feature Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11628)
*Jiacheng Liu,Chang Zou,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Fei Ren,Shaobo Wang,Kaixin Li,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpeCa introduces speculative sampling to diffusion models, achieving 6-7x acceleration with minimal quality degradation through forecast-then-verify framework and adaptive computation allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high computational demands that prevent real-time applications due to strict temporal dependencies and intensive forward passes at each denoising step.

Method: Uses speculative sampling inspired by LLMs, predicting intermediate features for future timesteps based on reference timesteps with parameter-free verification and sample-adaptive computation allocation.

Result: 6.34x acceleration on FLUX (5.5% quality drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT with preserved fidelity, 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo, with verification overhead of only 1.67%-3.5%.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference that maintains generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios through speculative sampling and adaptive computation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis,
yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications.
These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies
preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes
required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding
in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify'
acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's
core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models,
predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully
computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free
verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability,
enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while
incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces
sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources
based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler
samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances.
Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality
degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation
fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The
verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference
costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference
while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Compressed sensing enables signal reconstruction from sparse measurements by leveraging signal sparsity in transformed domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world signals are inherently sparse and can be efficiently represented with fewer components than their original space requires, making compressed sensing valuable for signal processing applications.

Method: Mathematical formulation and analysis of compressed sensing principles, including exploration of its logic and pathologies, followed by application to real-world signals.

Result: The paper presents the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of compressed sensing for reconstructing signals from limited measurements.

Conclusion: Compressed sensing provides an effective framework for reconstructing sparse signals from reduced measurement sets, with applications across various real-world signal processing domains.

Abstract: Compressed sensing is a signal processing technique that allows for the
reconstruction of a signal from a small set of measurements. The key idea
behind compressed sensing is that many real-world signals are inherently
sparse, meaning that they can be efficiently represented in a different space
with only a few components compared to their original space representation. In
this paper we will explore the mathematical formulation behind compressed
sensing, its logic and pathologies, and apply compressed sensing to real world
signals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Answer-Then-Check is a novel safety alignment approach that enhances LLM robustness against jailbreak attacks by having models first answer questions in their thoughts, then critically evaluate safety before providing final responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring LLM safety against jailbreak attacks remains a critical challenge as language models advance in capabilities.

Method: Constructed Reasoned Safety Alignment (ReSA) dataset with 80K examples to teach models to reason through direct responses and analyze safety. Models answer questions in thought first, then evaluate safety before deciding final response.

Result: Achieves Pareto frontier with superior safety capability while decreasing over-refusal rates. Maintains general reasoning capabilities on MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval benchmarks. Enables safe completion and helpful alternative responses for sensitive topics. Training on just 500 examples achieves comparable performance to full dataset.

Conclusion: Safety alignment may require less data than previously assumed. The approach provides robust protection against jailbreak attacks while maintaining model utility and enabling safe alternative responses.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, ensuring
their safety against jailbreak attacks remains a critical challenge. In this
paper, we introduce a novel safety alignment approach called Answer-Then-Check,
which enhances LLM robustness against malicious prompts by applying thinking
ability to mitigate jailbreaking problems before producing a final answer to
the user. Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their
thought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to
provide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety
Alignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason
through direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety
capability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks.
Notably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning
capabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. Besides, our
method equips models with the ability to perform safe completion. Unlike
post-hoc methods that can only reject harmful queries, our model can provide
helpful and safe alternative responses for sensitive topics (e.g., self-harm).
Furthermore, we discover that training on a small subset of just 500 examples
can achieve comparable performance to using the full dataset, suggesting that
safety alignment may require less data than previously assumed.

TL;DR: Using persistent GLMY homology theory to analyze reservoir network topology and optimize performance by modifying 1D homology groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reservoir networks are efficient for time series processing but their topology-performance relationship is poorly understood due to lack of mathematical tools.

Method: Apply persistent GLMY homology theory to study reservoir topology, develop optimization method by modifying minimal representative cycles of 1D GLMY homology groups.

Result: Found that reservoir performance is closely related to one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Performance is jointly influenced by reservoir structure and dataset periodicity.

Conclusion: GLMY homology theory provides effective mathematical framework for analyzing and optimizing reservoir network topology to improve time series processing performance.

Abstract: Reservoir is an efficient network for time series processing. It is well
known that network structure is one of the determinants of its performance.
However, the topology structure of reservoirs, as well as their performance, is
hard to analyzed, due to the lack of suitable mathematical tools. In this
paper, we study the topology structure of reservoirs using persistent GLMY
homology theory, and develop a method to improve its performance. Specifically,
it is found that the reservoir performance is closely related to the
one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Then, we develop a reservoir structure
optimization method by modifying the minimal representative cycles of
one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Finally, by experiments, it is validated
that the performance of reservoirs is jointly influenced by the reservoir
structure and the periodicity of the dataset.

TL;DR: A novel unlearning technique that uses PCA on activations and gradients to selectively target dangerous knowledge subspaces, achieving 80x better removal of hazardous facts while minimally impacting general performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning methods and safety training consistently fail to effectively remove dangerous knowledge from language models without disrupting general capabilities.

Method: Perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify subspaces containing common representations, collapse them before calculating unlearning updates to target only fact-specific representations.

Result: Dropped post-attack accuracy 80x more than best baseline on biohazardous facts and 30x more on cyberhazardous facts, with only 0.1% WikiText loss increase and requiring less than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.

Conclusion: The proposed selective unlearning technique robustly removes dangerous knowledge while preserving general performance, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Current unlearning techniques and safety training consistently fail to remove
dangerous knowledge from language models. We analyze the root causes and
propose a highly selective technique which unlearns robustly and without
disrupting general performance.
  We perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify
subspaces containing common representations, and collapse them before
calculating unlearning updates. This way we avoid unlearning general
representations, and only target those specific to the unlearned facts.
  When unlearning WMDP dataset facts from Llama-3.1-8B, we drop post-attack
accuracy 80x more than our best baseline (Circuit Breakers) on biohazardous
facts and 30x more on cyberhazardous facts. Despite this, we disrupt general
performance 30x less (only 0.1% WikiText loss increase), while requiring less
than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.

### [165] [Generalizing Behavior via Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Closed-Form Reward Centroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12010)
*Filippo Lazzati,Alberto Maria Metelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel criterion for selecting the "average" policy from the feasible set of reward functions in Inverse Reinforcement Learning, with a closed-form expression for the reward centroid and an efficient estimation algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IRL is ill-posed with multiple reward functions explaining the same expert behavior, requiring a principled criterion to select which policy to deploy in new environments/constraints.

Method: Develops a method to select the average policy from a bounded subset of feasible rewards by planning with the reward centroid, derives closed-form expression for centroid, and presents efficient algorithm for estimation using offline expert demonstrations.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrate the relationship between expert behavior and the behavior produced by the proposed method.

Conclusion: Provides a principled solution to the ill-posed nature of IRL by introducing an average policy criterion with theoretical guarantees and practical estimation methods.

Abstract: We study the problem of generalizing an expert agent's behavior, provided
through demonstrations, to new environments and/or additional constraints.
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) offers a promising solution by seeking to
recover the expert's underlying reward function, which, if used for planning in
the new settings, would reproduce the desired behavior. However, IRL is
inherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible
set, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce
different policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional
information, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy.
In this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the
"average" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset
of the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by
planning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a
closed-form expression. We then present a provably efficient algorithm for
estimating this centroid using an offline dataset of expert demonstrations
only. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations that illustrate the
relationship between the expert's behavior and the behavior produced by our
method.

TL;DR: AMQ is an automated framework for mixed-precision weight-only quantization that optimally assigns layer-wise bit-widths to balance LLM quality and memory usage, overcoming combinatorial search challenges through innovative techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models under strict memory constraints by identifying the best-performing models while maintaining quality.

Method: Uses four key innovations: search space pruning, quantization proxy, quality predictor, and iterative search-and-update strategy to efficiently explore the combinatorial search space of over 10^100 configurations.

Result: AMQ efficiently reaches the Pareto frontier, yielding LLMs that are both compact and high-performing while minimizing evaluation overhead and format conversion costs.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables optimal quantization of LLMs for memory-constrained deployments through automated mixed-precision assignment and efficient search techniques.

Abstract: To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is essential
to identify the best-performing model under strict memory constraints. We
present AMQ, Automated Mixed-Precision Weight-Only Quantization, a framework
that assigns layer-wise quantization bit-widths to optimally balance model
quality and memory usage. However, the combinatorial search space, with over
10^{100} possible configurations, makes conventional black-box optimization
infeasible. AMQ overcomes this challenge through four key innovations:(1)
search space pruning using prior knowledge to exclude unpromising
configurations, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions
during search, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4)
iterative search-and-update strategy for fast and stable convergence. By
integrating these components, AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency
landscape, reaching the Pareto frontier and yielding LLMs that are both compact
and high-performing. Our code is available at https://github.com/dlwns147/amq.

### [167] [Imitation Learning as Return Distribution Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12026)
*Filippo Lazzati,Alberto Maria Metelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Risk-sensitive imitation learning framework that matches expert's return distribution using Wasserstein distance, with efficient non-Markovian policies and provable algorithms for both known and unknown transition models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard imitation learning only matches expected return, but real-world applications require matching the expert's risk attitude and full return distribution characteristics like variance, not just average performance.

Method: Proposes Wasserstein distance matching of return distributions, introduces expressive non-Markovian policies, and develops two algorithms: RS-BC (unknown transitions) and RS-KT (known transitions) with theoretical guarantees.

Result: RS-KT achieves substantially lower sample complexity than RS-BC by leveraging dynamics information. Non-Markovian policies outperform standard IL algorithms in sample efficiency and distribution matching.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses risk-sensitive imitation learning, demonstrating that matching full return distributions with specialized non-Markovian policies provides superior performance over traditional methods that only match expected returns.

Abstract: We study the problem of training a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL)
agent through imitation learning (IL). Unlike standard IL, our goal is not only
to train an agent that matches the expert's expected return (i.e., its average
performance) but also its risk attitude (i.e., other features of the return
distribution, such as variance). We propose a general formulation of the
risk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's
return distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting
and assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited
expressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and
sufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it.
Building on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC
and RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and
known, respectively. We show that RS-KT achieves substantially lower sample
complexity than RS-BC by exploiting dynamics information. We further
demonstrate the sample efficiency of return distribution matching in the
setting where the expert's reward is unknown by designing an oracle-based
variant of RS-KT. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis of RS-KT and
RS-BC with numerical simulations, highlighting both their sample efficiency and
the advantages of non-Markovian policies over standard sample-efficient IL
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection approaches struggle with scalability, probabilistic interpretability, and adaptability to evolving traffic patterns in dynamic graphs, which are essential for identifying malicious activities in systems like cybersecurity and power grids.

Method: Integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to track edge frequency patterns with bounded memory, incorporates Bayesian inference for probabilistic anomaly scoring, and applies Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for adaptive thresholding tuned to burst intensity.

Conclusion: ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH is practical and effective for fast, accurate anomaly detection in large-scale streaming graphs, addressing key limitations of existing approaches while maintaining high efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs is essential for identifying malicious

*Mohammadreza Narimani,Alireza Pourreza,Ali Moghimi,Parastoo Farajpoor,Hamid Jafarbiglu,Mohsen B. Mesgaran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Early detection of parasitic weed broomrape in tomato plants using leaf spectral reflectance and ensemble machine learning achieved 89% accuracy before visible symptoms appear.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Branched broomrape threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from host plants, requiring early detection before visible canopy symptoms to enable targeted interventions and reduce yield losses.

Method: Field experiment tracking 300 tomato plants across growth stages using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm), preprocessing (denoising, interpolation, smoothing, band reduction), and ensemble machine learning combining Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes.

Result: 89% detection accuracy at 585 growing degree days with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected), showing clear spectral differences near water absorption features (1500 nm and 2000 nm) indicating reduced leaf water content in infected plants.

Conclusion: Proximal sensing with ensemble learning enables timely detection of broomrape before visible symptoms, supporting targeted control measures despite challenges from small infected sample size and environmental confounders.

Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic
weed that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host. We
investigate early detection using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm)
and ensemble machine learning. In a field experiment in Woodland, California,
we tracked 300 tomato plants across growth stages defined by growing degree
days (GDD). Leaf reflectance was acquired with a portable spectrometer and
preprocessed (band denoising, 1 nm interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing,
correlation-based band reduction). Clear class differences were observed near
1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features, consistent with reduced leaf
water content in infected plants at early stages. An ensemble combining Random
Forest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes achieved 89% accuracy at
585 GDD, with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected). Accuracy
declined at later stages (e.g., 69% at 1568 GDD), likely due to senescence and
weed interference. Despite the small number of infected plants and
environmental confounders, results show that proximal sensing with ensemble
learning enables timely detection of broomrape before canopy symptoms are
visible, supporting targeted interventions and reduced yield losses.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how different online data sources (social media, news, aerial/satellite imagery) can estimate disaster impact at county level, comparing them with traditional offline assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional disaster assessment methods have time delays and biases. Online data sources provide real-time information but limited research exists on how different online sources help estimate disaster impact at administrative unit level.

Method: Curated a comprehensive dataset by collecting data from multiple online sources for billion-dollar disasters at county level, and analyzed how online estimates compare with traditional offline-based impact estimates.

Result: The study provides insights into how different online sources can provide complementary information for disaster assessment.

Conclusion: Online data sources offer valuable real-time capabilities for disaster impact assessment and can complement traditional offline methods, providing more comprehensive disaster evaluation.

Abstract: Assessing the impact of a disaster in terms of asset losses and human
casualties is essential for preparing effective response plans. Traditional
methods include offline assessments conducted on the ground, where volunteers
and first responders work together to collect the estimate of losses through
windshield surveys or on-ground inspection. However, these methods have a time
delay and are prone to different biases. Recently, various online data sources,
including social media, news reports, aerial imagery, and satellite data, have
been utilized to evaluate the impact of disasters. Online data sources provide
real-time data streams for estimating the offline impact. Limited research
exists on how different online sources help estimate disaster impact at a given
administrative unit. In our work, we curate a comprehensive dataset by
collecting data from multiple online sources for a few billion-dollar disasters
at the county level. We also analyze how online estimates compare with
traditional offline-based impact estimates for the disaster. Our findings
provide insight into how different sources can provide complementary
information to assess the disaster.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revolutionize time-series forecasting by integrating principled dynamical systems theory (Takens' embedding theorem) with modern deep learning approaches for more accurate and interpretable predictions.

Method: Constructs 2D subspace patches from Hankel matrices using delay embedding, treats them as images for deep learning processing, and uses self-attention encoder to learn finite-dimensional Koopman operator for linear prediction in latent space.

Result: 20% average reduction in mean squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models across various benchmarks and real-world climate datasets, with superior generalization in fine-tuning scenarios.

Conclusion: UDE establishes a scalable, interpretable framework for universal time-series modeling with exceptional interpretability, consistent identification of topologically informative subspaces, and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics.

Abstract: This study introduces Universal Delay Embedding (UDE), a pretrained
foundation model designed to revolutionize time-series forecasting through
principled integration of delay embedding representation and Koopman operator
prediction. Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical
representation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches
from Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological
properties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images,
which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning
technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for
learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of
nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear
manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and
real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean
squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior
generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical
representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit
exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically
informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics,
establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal
time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial
applicability.

*HG Ranjani,Rutuja Prabhudesai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes performance metrics to evaluate VLM conversion of telecom sequence diagrams to PlantUML format, comparing Claude Sonnet and GPT-4V against ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works don't adequately evaluate PlantUML conversions from telecom sequence diagrams, lacking component-wise comparison metrics.

Method: Created dataset from 3GPP documents, used version control tools to capture differences, and introduced metrics for participant identification, message flow, sequence ordering, and grouping constructs.

Result: VLMs accurately capture nodes, edges, and messages but perform poorly on complex structures like notes, boxes, and groups.

Conclusion: There's a need for better representation of complex components in training data for fine-tuned VLMs to improve conversion accuracy.

Abstract: Telecom domain 3GPP documents are replete with images containing sequence
diagrams. Advances in Vision-Language Large Models (VLMs) have eased conversion
of such images to machine-readable PlantUML (puml) formats. However, there is a
gap in evaluation of such conversions - existing works do not compare puml
scripts for various components. In this work, we propose performance metrics to
measure the effectiveness of such conversions. A dataset of sequence diagrams
from 3GPP documents is chosen to be representative of domain-specific actual
scenarios. We compare puml outputs from two VLMs - Claude Sonnet and GPT-4V -
against manually created ground truth representations. We use version control
tools to capture differences and introduce standard performance metrics to
measure accuracies along various components: participant identification,
message flow accuracy, sequence ordering, and grouping construct preservation.
We demonstrate effectiveness of proposed metrics in quantifying conversion
errors across various components of puml scripts. The results show that nodes,
edges and messages are accurately captured. However, we observe that VLMs do
not necessarily perform well on complex structures such as notes, box, groups.
Our experiments and performance metrics indicates a need for better
representation of these components in training data for fine-tuned VLMs.

TL;DR: Proposes deceptive risk minimization (DRM) for OOD generalization by learning representations that make training data appear iid, eliminating spurious correlations without needing test data or domain partitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address out-of-distribution generalization by identifying stable features that eliminate spurious correlations, without requiring access to test data or predefined domain partitions like traditional methods.

Method: Deceptive risk minimization (DRM) with differentiable objective that learns features to eliminate distribution shifts using conformal martingales while minimizing task-specific loss.

Result: Demonstrated efficacy through numerical experiments with concept shift and simulated imitation learning with covariate shift in robot deployment environments.

Conclusion: DRM provides effective OOD generalization by learning deceptive representations that make training data appear iid, outperforming methods that require domain partitioning or test data access.

Abstract: This paper proposes deception as a mechanism for out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization: by learning data representations that make training data appear
independent and identically distributed (iid) to an observer, we can identify
stable features that eliminate spurious correlations and generalize to unseen
domains. We refer to this principle as deceptive risk minimization (DRM) and
instantiate it with a practical differentiable objective that simultaneously
learns features that eliminate distribution shifts from the perspective of a
detector based on conformal martingales while minimizing a task-specific loss.
In contrast to domain adaptation or prior invariant representation learning
methods, DRM does not require access to test data or a partitioning of training
data into a finite number of data-generating domains. We demonstrate the
efficacy of DRM on numerical experiments with concept shift and a simulated
imitation learning setting with covariate shift in environments that a robot is
deployed in.

TL;DR: A causal interventional tool for disaster analysis that enables "what-if" scenarios and causal attribution, complementing traditional predictive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional disaster modeling tools are predictive but not interventional - they can't simulate counterfactual scenarios or show causal relationships between factors and disaster severity.

Method: Leverages real-time data sources (satellite imagery, news, social media) to create an interventional tool that allows users to modify input states and simulate different scenarios.

Result: Developed a tool that provides causal attribution of different factors on disaster severity estimates and offers actionable recourses for mitigation planning.

Conclusion: The interventional approach complements traditional predictive disaster modeling by enabling scenario simulation and causal analysis, with publicly available source code.

Abstract: Traditional disaster analysis and modelling tools for assessing the severity
of a disaster are predictive in nature. Based on the past observational data,
these tools prescribe how the current input state (e.g., environmental
conditions, situation reports) results in a severity assessment. However, these
systems are not meant to be interventional in the causal sense, where the user
can modify the current input state to simulate counterfactual "what-if"
scenarios. In this work, we provide an alternative interventional tool that
complements traditional disaster modelling tools by leveraging real-time data
sources like satellite imagery, news, and social media. Our tool also helps
understand the causal attribution of different factors on the estimated
severity, over any given region of interest. In addition, we provide actionable
recourses that would enable easier mitigation planning. Our source code is
publicly available.

### [175] [$K$-Level Policy Gradients for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12117)
*Aryaman Reddi,Gabriele Tiboni,Jan Peters,Carlo D'Eramo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-Level Policy Gradient (KPG) is a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method that recursively updates agents against each other's updated policies to improve coordination and achieve faster convergence to local Nash equilibria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard actor-critic algorithms in multi-agent RL update policies based on current opponent strategies without accounting for simultaneous updates, leading to miscoordination problems.

Method: KPG recursively updates each agent against the updated policies of other agents through K-level recursion, applied to existing deep MARL algorithms like MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC.

Result: Theoretical proof shows finite-iterate KPG achieves monotonic convergence to local Nash equilibrium. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance in StarCraft II and multi-agent MuJoCo benchmarks.

Conclusion: KPG effectively addresses coordination issues in multi-agent RL by considering simultaneous policy updates, leading to faster discovery of coordinated policies and improved performance across various environments.

Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
typically employ a policy update that responds to the current strategies of
other agents. While being straightforward, this approach does not account for
the updates of other agents at the same update step, resulting in
miscoordination. In this paper, we introduce the $K$-Level Policy Gradient
(KPG), a method that recursively updates each agent against the updated
policies of other agents, speeding up the discovery of effective coordinated
policies. We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves
monotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We
provide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL
algorithms MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC. Empirically, we demonstrate superior
performance over existing deep MARL algorithms in StarCraft II and multi-agent
MuJoCo.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CANOE is a chaotic neural oscillator network that addresses dynamic imbalance in mobility patterns and underutilization of contextual cues for next location prediction, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle the dynamic imbalance between periodic and chaotic mobility patterns and underutilize contextual cues like temporal regularities, which offer stronger predictability than spatial forecasts due to reduced search spaces.

Method: Proposes CANOE with a biologically inspired Chaotic Neural Oscillatory Attention mechanism to inject adaptive variability into traditional attention, and employs a Tri-Pair Interaction Encoder with Cross Context Attentive Decoder to fuse multimodal 'who-when-where' contexts in a joint framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show CANOE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with 3.17%-13.11% improvement, making robust predictions across different mobility chaotic levels.

Conclusion: CANOE effectively addresses the challenges of dynamic pattern imbalance and contextual underutilization in next location prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness through its biologically inspired attention mechanism and multimodal context fusion approach.

Abstract: Next location prediction is a key task in human mobility analysis, crucial
for applications like smart city resource allocation and personalized
navigation services. However, existing methods face two significant challenges:
first, they fail to address the dynamic imbalance between periodic and chaotic
mobile patterns, leading to inadequate adaptation over sparse trajectories;
second, they underutilize contextual cues, such as temporal regularities in
arrival times, which persist even in chaotic patterns and offer stronger
predictability than spatial forecasts due to reduced search spaces. To tackle
these challenges, we propose \textbf{\method}, a
\underline{\textbf{C}}h\underline{\textbf{A}}otic \underline{\textbf{N}}eural
\underline{\textbf{O}}scillator n\underline{\textbf{E}}twork for next location
prediction, which introduces a biologically inspired Chaotic Neural Oscillatory
Attention mechanism to inject adaptive variability into traditional attention,
enabling balanced representation of evolving mobility behaviors, and employs a
Tri-Pair Interaction Encoder along with a Cross Context Attentive Decoder to
fuse multimodal ``who-when-where'' contexts in a joint framework for enhanced
prediction performance. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate that CANOE consistently and significantly outperforms a sizeable
collection of state-of-the-art baselines, yielding 3.17\%-13.11\% improvement
over the best-performing baselines across different cases. In particular, CANOE
can make robust predictions over mobility trajectories of different mobility
chaotic levels. A series of ablation studies also supports our key design
choices. Our code is available at: https://github.com/yuqian2003/CANOE.

### [177] [Dynamic Relational Priming Improves Transformer in Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12196)
*Hunjae Lee,Corey Clark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prime attention improves transformer performance for multivariate time series by dynamically tailoring token representations for each pair-wise interaction, achieving up to 6.5% better forecasting accuracy with same computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard attention uses static token representations that limit its ability to capture diverse relational dynamics in multivariate time series data, where different channel-pair interactions may be governed by entirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics.

Method: Proposed attention with dynamic relational priming (prime attention) that tailors each token dynamically through learnable modulations per interaction to capture unique relational dynamics of each token pair, maintaining same asymptotic computational complexity as standard attention.

Result: Prime attention consistently outperforms standard attention across benchmarks with up to 6.5% improvement in forecasting accuracy, and achieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40% less sequence length.

Conclusion: Prime attention's representational plasticity enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in multivariate time series while maintaining computational efficiency, demonstrating superior relational modeling capabilities compared to standard attention.

Abstract: Standard attention mechanisms in transformers employ static token
representations that remain unchanged across all pair-wise computations in each
layer. This limits their representational alignment with the potentially
diverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in
domains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static
relational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous
inter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where
different channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by
entirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the
attention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with
dynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where
each token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise
interactions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per
interaction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique
relational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction
for that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime
attention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in
MTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard
attention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently
outperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\%
improvement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention
achieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\% less sequence
length compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior
relational modeling capabilities.

*Wa-Kin Lei,Jun-Cheng Chen,Shang-Tse Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel data reconstruction attack using guided diffusion to recover high-fidelity images from intermediate representations in split inference settings, demonstrating significant privacy risks for foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored privacy risks of foundation models in split inference scenarios, where most existing attacks focus only on smaller CNN models, leaving large foundation models vulnerable.

Method: Proposes a guided diffusion-based attack that leverages the rich prior knowledge in pre-trained latent diffusion models to perform iterative reconstruction from intermediate representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively in reconstructing data from deep-layer intermediate representations of vision foundation models.

Conclusion: The results reveal urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms for large models in split inference scenarios, as current approaches are vulnerable to sophisticated reconstruction attacks.

Abstract: With the rise of large foundation models, split inference (SI) has emerged as
a popular computational paradigm for deploying models across lightweight edge
devices and cloud servers, addressing data privacy and computational cost
concerns. However, most existing data reconstruction attacks have focused on
smaller CNN classification models, leaving the privacy risks of foundation
models in SI settings largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a
novel data reconstruction attack based on guided diffusion, which leverages the
rich prior knowledge embedded in a latent diffusion model (LDM) pre-trained on
a large-scale dataset. Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the
LDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images
resembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in
reconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The
results highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms
for large models in SI scenarios. Code is available at:

*Lauri Seppäläinen,Jakub Kubečka,Jonas Elm,Kai Puolamäki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: k-NN regression with chemically informed distance metrics provides fast, accurate alternative to quantum chemistry for atmospheric cluster formation modeling, achieving near-chemical accuracy with orders of magnitude speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum chemistry provides accurate insights into atmospheric molecular cluster formation but has prohibitive computational costs that limit large-scale exploration needed for climate modeling.

Method: Used k-nearest neighbor regression with chemically informed distance metrics (kernel-induced metric and MLKR-learned metric) and FCHL19 molecular descriptor to predict cluster properties.

Result: k-NN models achieved near-chemical accuracy, scaled to datasets with 250,000+ entries, reduced computational time by orders of magnitude compared to KRR, and extrapolated well to larger unseen clusters with minimal error (~1 kcal/mol).

Conclusion: k-NN regression is a potent, interpretable tool for accelerating atmospheric chemistry discovery, offering comparable accuracy to complex models with built-in uncertainty estimation and scalability.

Abstract: Understanding how atmospheric molecular clusters form and grow is key to
resolving one of the biggest uncertainties in climate modelling: the formation
of new aerosol particles. While quantum chemistry offers accurate insights into
these early-stage clusters, its steep computational costs limit large-scale
exploration. In this work, we present a fast, interpretable, and surprisingly
powerful alternative: $k$-nearest neighbour ($k$-NN) regression model. By
leveraging chemically informed distance metrics, including a kernel-induced
metric and one learned via metric learning for kernel regression (MLKR), we
show that simple $k$-NN models can rival more complex kernel ridge regression
(KRR) models in accuracy, while reducing computational time by orders of
magnitude. We perform this comparison with the well-established
Faber-Christensen-Huang-Lilienfeld (FCHL19) molecular descriptor, but other
descriptors (e.g., FCHL18, MBDF, and CM) can be shown to have similar
performance. Applied to both simple organic molecules in the QM9 benchmark set
and large datasets of atmospheric molecular clusters (sulphuric acid-water and
sulphuric-multibase -base systems), our $k$-NN models achieve near-chemical
accuracy, scale seamlessly to datasets with over 250,000 entries, and even
appears to extrapolate to larger unseen clusters with minimal error (often
nearing 1 kcal/mol). With built-in interpretability and straightforward
uncertainty estimation, this work positions $k$-NN as a potent tool for
accelerating discovery in atmospheric chemistry and beyond.

*Abdella Mohamed,Xiangyu Hu,Christian Hendricks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study evaluates machine learning for ship fuel consumption prediction using voyage reports and external climate/sea data, finding strong potential but needing validation on similar vessel classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address IMO mandates for reducing ship fuel consumption and carbon emissions by improving fuel efficiency prediction through data fusion approaches.

Method: Used 296 voyage reports from a bulk carrier with 28 parameters, integrated with hydrometeorological big data from CMEMS (19 parameters) and ECMWF (61 parameters) to build predictive models.

Result: Machine learning techniques show strong potential for accurate fuel consumption prediction when combining voyage reports with climate and sea state data.

Conclusion: External public data sources enhance modeling accuracy, but validation on similar vessel classes is necessary to confirm generalizability of the approach.

Abstract: There is an increasing push for operational measures to reduce ships' bunker
fuel consumption and carbon emissions, driven by the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) mandates. Key performance indicators such as the Energy
Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) focus on fuel efficiency. Strategies
like trim optimization, virtual arrival, and green routing have emerged. The
theoretical basis for these approaches lies in accurate prediction of fuel
consumption as a function of sailing speed, displacement, trim, climate, and
sea state. This study utilized 296 voyage reports from a bulk carrier vessel
over one year (November 16, 2021 to November 21, 2022) and 28 parameters,
integrating hydrometeorological big data from the Copernicus Marine Environment
Monitoring Service (CMEMS) with 19 parameters and the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) with 61 parameters. The objective was to
evaluate whether fusing external public data sources enhances modeling accuracy
and to highlight the most influential parameters affecting fuel consumption.
The results reveal a strong potential for machine learning techniques to
predict ship fuel consumption accurately by combining voyage reports with
climate and sea data. However, validation on similar classes of vessels remains
necessary to confirm generalizability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs training loss has local minima at fixed points of dynamical systems, which can lead to physically incorrect solutions. This paper proposes a regularization scheme to penalize unstable fixed points, improving training success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local minima in PINNs loss functions correspond to fixed points of dynamical systems, which can interfere with training and produce physically incorrect solutions for initial value problems.

Method: Proposes a regularization scheme based on stability theory that penalizes solutions corresponding to unstable fixed points in dynamical systems.

Result: Experimental results on four dynamical systems (including Lotka-Volterra and van der Pol oscillator) show the scheme helps avoid physically incorrect solutions and substantially improves PINNs training success rate.

Conclusion: The proposed regularization scheme effectively addresses the issue of local minima at fixed points, leading to more reliable and physically accurate PINNs training for dynamical systems.

Abstract: It was recently shown that the loss function used for training
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) exhibits local minima at solutions
corresponding to fixed points of dynamical systems. In the forward setting,
where the PINN is trained to solve initial value problems, these local minima
can interfere with training and potentially leading to physically incorrect
solutions. Building on stability theory, this paper proposes a regularization
scheme that penalizes solutions corresponding to unstable fixed points.
Experimental results on four dynamical systems, including the Lotka-Volterra
model and the van der Pol oscillator, show that our scheme helps avoiding
physically incorrect solutions and substantially improves the training success
rate of PINNs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal framework combining language models, CNNs, GNNs, and symbolic regression to predict enzyme turnover rates from sequences, substrates, and environmental factors, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enzyme turnover rates are fundamental for understanding catalytic efficiency but remain scarce due to high experimental measurement costs and complexity.

Method: Integrates enzyme sequences (using pre-trained language model + CNN), substrate structures (using graph neural network), and environmental factors with attention mechanism. Uses symbolic regression via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to learn interpretable mathematical formulas.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for enzyme turnover rate prediction.

Conclusion: Provides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics with applications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis.

Abstract: The enzyme turnover rate is a fundamental parameter in enzyme kinetics,
reflecting the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. However, enzyme turnover rates
remain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of
experimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
framework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme
sequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines
a pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract
features from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures
informative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is
incorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate
representations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that
govern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate
predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms
both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This work
provides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics and holds promise for
applications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis.

TL;DR: Real-time fall detection framework using IMU data and cost-sensitive learning achieves perfect recall (1.00) with high precision (0.84) and fast inference (<5ms).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fall detection methods rely on simulated data or prior knowledge of falls, limiting real-world applicability. Need for efficient computation and robust evaluation for continuous monitoring.

Method: Uses 60+ hours of IMU data from FARSEEING dataset with efficient classifiers in streaming mode. Introduces cost-sensitive learning strategy that tunes decision threshold based on higher risk of missed falls vs false alarms.

Result: Achieved Recall: 1.00, Precision: 0.84, F1 score: 0.91 on FARSEEING dataset. Detected all falls with low false alarms. Average inference time below 5ms per sample.

Conclusion: Cost-sensitive threshold tuning enhances robustness of accelerometer-based fall detection. Framework shows potential for deployment in real-time wearable sensor systems for continuous monitoring.

Abstract: Real-time fall detection is crucial for enabling timely interventions and
mitigating the severe health consequences of falls, particularly in older
adults. However, existing methods often rely on simulated data or assumptions
such as prior knowledge of fall events, limiting their real-world
applicability. Practical deployment also requires efficient computation and
robust evaluation metrics tailored to continuous monitoring. This paper
presents a real-time fall detection framework for continuous monitoring without
prior knowledge of fall events. Using over 60 hours of inertial measurement
unit (IMU) data from the FARSEEING real-world falls dataset, we employ recent
efficient classifiers to compute fall probabilities in streaming mode. To
enhance robustness, we introduce a cost-sensitive learning strategy that tunes
the decision threshold using a cost function reflecting the higher risk of
missed falls compared to false alarms. Unlike many methods that achieve high
recall only at the cost of precision, our framework achieved Recall of 1.00,
Precision of 0.84, and an F1 score of 0.91 on FARSEEING, detecting all falls
while keeping false alarms low, with average inference time below 5 ms per
sample. These results demonstrate that cost-sensitive threshold tuning enhances
the robustness of accelerometer-based fall detection. They also highlight the
potential of our computationally efficient framework for deployment in
real-time wearable sensor systems for continuous monitoring.

Result: The learnable projection method surpasses PCA-based approach with accurate high-dimensional parameter reconstruction and lower memory usage. Architecture, sparsification, and preconditioning significantly impact optimization landscape and final performance.

Conclusion: These insights contribute to developing more efficient designs of GNN architectures and training strategies through better understanding of optimization landscapes.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful models for graph-structured data,
with broad applications. However, the interplay between GNN parameter
optimization, expressivity, and generalization remains poorly understood. We
address this by introducing an efficient learnable dimensionality reduction
method for visualizing GNN loss landscapes, and by analyzing the effects of
over-smoothing, jumping knowledge, quantization, sparsification, and
preconditioner on GNN optimization. Our learnable projection method surpasses
the state-of-the-art PCA-based approach, enabling accurate reconstruction of
high-dimensional parameters with lower memory usage. We further show that
architecture, sparsification, and optimizer's preconditioning significantly
impact the GNN optimization landscape and their training process and final
prediction performance. These insights contribute to developing more efficient
designs of GNN architectures and training strategies.

*Mrinmay Sen,Ankita Das,Sidhant Nair,C Krishna Mohan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDAF is a novel Federated Domain Adaptation approach that addresses both domain shifts and limited target data by using similarity-based aggregation of global source and target models through functional distance measurement of gradient fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FDA methods focus mainly on domain shifts and assume ample target data, neglecting the combined challenges of domain shifts and data scarcity. Current approaches also fail to prioritize sharing relevant information from source clients according to target objectives.

Method: FedDAF calculates model functional distance by computing the angle between mean gradient fields of global source and target models on target data, then normalizes with the Gompertz function. Global source model is aggregated from local source models using simple averaging.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show FedDAF achieves superior test accuracy compared to existing FL, PFL, and FDA methods.

Conclusion: FedDAF effectively addresses both domain shift and data scarcity challenges in federated domain adaptation by enabling target-objective-aware model aggregation through functional distance measurement, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) is a federated learning (FL) approach that
improves model performance at the target client by collaborating with source
clients while preserving data privacy. FDA faces two primary challenges: domain
shifts between source and target data and limited labeled data at the target.
Most existing FDA methods focus on domain shifts, assuming ample target data,
yet often neglect the combined challenges of both domain shifts and data
scarcity. Moreover, approaches that address both challenges fail to prioritize
sharing relevant information from source clients according to the target's
objective. In this paper, we propose FedDAF, a novel approach addressing both
challenges in FDA. FedDAF uses similarity-based aggregation of the global
source model and target model by calculating model functional distance from
their mean gradient fields computed on target data. This enables effective
model aggregation based on the target objective, constructed using target data,
even with limited data. While computing model functional distance between these
two models, FedDAF computes the angle between their mean gradient fields and
then normalizes with the Gompertz function. To construct the global source
model, all the local source models are aggregated using simple average in the
server. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDAF's superiority
over existing FL, PFL, and FDA methods in terms of achieving better test
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address transparency and fairness concerns with black-box machine learning models used for statistical profiling in long-term unemployment prediction.

Method: Compare traditional statistical, interpretable, and black-box models using Swiss administrative data, evaluating predictive performance, interpretability, and fairness.

Result: Explainable boosting machines perform nearly as well as best black-box models, with model sparsity, feature smoothing, and fairness mitigation enhancing transparency and fairness with minor performance loss.

Conclusion: Interpretable profiling provides an accountable and trustworthy alternative to black-box models without compromising performance in long-term unemployment prediction.

Abstract: Long-term unemployment (LTU) is a challenge for both jobseekers and public
employment services. Statistical profiling tools are increasingly used to
predict LTU risk. Some profiling tools are opaque, black-box machine learning
models, which raise issues of transparency and fairness. This paper
investigates whether interpretable models could serve as an alternative, using
administrative data from Switzerland. Traditional statistical, interpretable,
and black-box models are compared in terms of predictive performance,
interpretability, and fairness. It is shown that explainable boosting machines,
a recent interpretable model, perform nearly as well as the best black-box
models. It is also shown how model sparsity, feature smoothing, and fairness
mitigation can enhance transparency and fairness with only minor losses in
performance. These findings suggest that interpretable profiling provides an
accountable and trustworthy alternative to black-box models without
compromising performance.

TL;DR: Proposes TabStruct framework with global utility metric to evaluate tabular data generators by combining structural fidelity with conventional metrics, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that lack ground-truth causal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular generator evaluation benchmarks neglect the interplay between structural fidelity and conventional metrics, are limited to toy datasets, and require ground-truth causal structures which are rarely available in real-world scenarios.

Method: Introduces global utility metric to assess structural fidelity without ground-truth causal structures, and creates TabStruct benchmark with comprehensive evaluation of 13 tabular generators across 29 datasets from nine categories.

Result: Demonstrates that global utility provides task-independent, domain-agnostic evaluation of tabular generator performance, enabling holistic assessment of model capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a comprehensive evaluation approach for tabular data generators, addressing key limitations of existing methods and providing practical tools for real-world applications through the released benchmark suite.

Abstract: Evaluating tabular generators remains a challenging problem, as the unique
causal structural prior of heterogeneous tabular data does not lend itself to
intuitive human inspection. Recent work has introduced structural fidelity as a
tabular-specific evaluation dimension to assess whether synthetic data complies
with the causal structures of real data. However, existing benchmarks often
neglect the interplay between structural fidelity and conventional evaluation
dimensions, thus failing to provide a holistic understanding of model
performance. Moreover, they are typically limited to toy datasets, as
quantifying existing structural fidelity metrics requires access to
ground-truth causal structures, which are rarely available for real-world
datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that jointly
considers structural fidelity and conventional evaluation dimensions. We
introduce a new evaluation metric, $\textbf{global utility}$, which enables the
assessment of structural fidelity even in the absence of ground-truth causal
structures. In addition, we present $\textbf{TabStruct}$, a comprehensive
evaluation benchmark offering large-scale quantitative analysis on 13 tabular
generators from nine distinct categories, across 29 datasets. Our results
demonstrate that global utility provides a task-independent, domain-agnostic
lens for tabular generator performance. We release the TabStruct benchmark
suite, including all datasets, evaluation pipelines, and raw results. Code is

*Sangjoon Park,Yeonjong Shin,Jinhyun Choo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepONet-based surrogate model for efficient simulation of poroelastic systems with random permeability fields, achieving high accuracy and substantial speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poroelastic simulations with random permeability fields are computationally expensive for probabilistic analysis and uncertainty quantification, creating need for efficient surrogate models.

Method: Deep operator network (DeepONet) architecture with three strategies: nondimensionalization of equations, input dimensionality reduction via Karhunen-Loève expansion, and two-step training procedure decoupling branch and trunk networks.

Result: Achieved substantial speedup in inference while maintaining high predictive accuracy across wide range of permeability statistics in soil consolidation and groundwater extraction benchmark problems.

Conclusion: The proposed DeepONet approach shows potential as scalable and efficient surrogate modeling technique for poroelastic systems with random permeability fields.

Abstract: Poroelasticity -- coupled fluid flow and elastic deformation in porous media
-- often involves spatially variable permeability, especially in subsurface
systems. In such cases, simulations with random permeability fields are widely
used for probabilistic analysis, uncertainty quantification, and inverse
problems. These simulations require repeated forward solves that are often
prohibitively expensive, motivating the development of efficient surrogate
models. However, efficient surrogate modeling techniques for poroelasticity
with random permeability fields remain scarce. In this study, we propose a
surrogate modeling framework based on the deep operator network (DeepONet), a
neural architecture designed to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces. The proposed surrogate model approximates the solution
operator that maps random permeability fields to transient poroelastic
responses. To enhance predictive accuracy and stability, we integrate three
strategies: nondimensionalization of the governing equations, input
dimensionality reduction via Karhunen--Lo\'eve expansion, and a two-step
training procedure that decouples the optimization of branch and trunk
networks. The methodology is evaluated on two benchmark problems in
poroelasticity: soil consolidation and ground subsidence induced by groundwater
extraction. In both cases, the DeepONet achieves substantial speedup in
inference while maintaining high predictive accuracy across a wide range of
permeability statistics. These results highlight the potential of the proposed
approach as a scalable and efficient surrogate modeling technique for
poroelastic systems with random permeability fields.

*Harold Triedman,Vitaly Shmatikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MillStone benchmark measures how LLM stances on controversial issues are influenced by external arguments, finding LLMs are generally open-minded but easily swayed by authoritative sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs with web search capabilities replace traditional search engines, understanding how their outputs are influenced by information sources is crucial, especially for controversial topics.

Method: Created MillStone benchmark to systematically measure how external arguments affect LLM stances on controversial issues, testing nine leading LLMs on their openness to opposing arguments.

Result: LLMs are generally open-minded on most issues but can be easily swayed by authoritative sources, highlighting manipulation risks in LLM-based information systems.

Conclusion: Source selection is critical as LLM stances can be manipulated, emphasizing the need for careful information source management in LLM-based search systems.

Abstract: Large language models equipped with Web search, information retrieval tools,
and other agentic capabilities are beginning to supplant traditional search
engines. As users start to rely on LLMs for information on many topics,
including controversial and debatable issues, it is important to understand how
the stances and opinions expressed in LLM outputs are influenced by the
documents they use as their information sources.
  In this paper, we present MillStone, the first benchmark that aims to
systematically measure the effect of external arguments on the stances that
LLMs take on controversial issues (not all of them political). We apply
MillStone to nine leading LLMs and measure how ``open-minded'' they are to
arguments supporting opposite sides of these issues, whether different LLMs
agree with each other, which arguments LLMs find most persuasive, and whether
these arguments are the same for different LLMs.
  In general, we find that LLMs are open-minded on most issues. An
authoritative source of information can easily sway an LLM's stance,
highlighting the importance of source selection and the risk that LLM-based
information retrieval and search systems can be manipulated.

### [190] [Examining the Relationship between Scientific Publishing Activity and Hype-Driven Financial Bubbles: A Comparison of the Dot-Com and AI Eras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11982)
*Aksheytha Chelikavada,Casey C. Bennett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of scientific citation networks from dot-com era (1994-2001) and AI era (2017-2024) shows dot-com bubble patterns don't reliably predict AI market behavior, suggesting either an unprecedented bubble form or no bubble exists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if scientific publishing data (citation networks) can provide early warning signals for financial bubbles, building on the observation that technologies behind bubbles like dot-com originated from years of prior scientific research.

Method: Used temporal social network analysis (SNA) on publication citation networks from dot-com era (1994-2001) and AI era (2017-2024), combined with multiple analysis techniques including LSTM, KNN, and AR X/GARCH models.

Result: Dot-com era patterns did not definitively predict AI bubble rise/fall. While yearly citation networks showed changes in publishing behavior, a subset of AI scientists mirrored dot-com patterns. Analysis suggests either unprecedented bubble form or no bubble in AI era.

Conclusion: Patterns from dot-com era do not effectively translate to predict AI market behavior, indicating limitations in using historical bubble patterns for forecasting future technological market disruptions.

Abstract: Financial bubbles often arrive without much warning, but create long-lasting
economic effects. For example, during the dot-com bubble, innovative
technologies created market disruptions through excitement for a promised
bright future. Such technologies originated from research where scientists had
developed them for years prior to their entry into the markets. That raises a
question on the possibility of analyzing scientific publishing data (e.g.
citation networks) leading up to a bubble for signals that may forecast the
rise and fall of similar future bubbles. To that end, we utilized temporal SNAs
to detect possible relationships between the publication citation networks of
scientists and financial market data during two modern eras of rapidly shifting
technology: 1) dot-com era from 1994 to 2001 and 2) AI era from 2017 to 2024.
Results showed that the patterns from the dot-com era (which did end in a
bubble) did not definitively predict the rise and fall of an AI bubble. While
yearly citation networks reflected possible changes in publishing behavior of
scientists between the two eras, there was a subset of AI era scientists whose
publication influence patterns mirrored those during the dot-com era. Upon
further analysis using multiple analysis techniques (LSTM, KNN, AR X/GARCH),
the data seems to suggest two possibilities for the AI era: unprecedented form
of financial bubble unseen or that no bubble exists. In conclusion, our
findings imply that the patterns present in the dot-com era do not effectively
translate in such a manner to apply them to the AI market.

### [191] [Low-rank Orthogonalization for Large-scale Matrix Optimization with Applications to Foundation Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11983)
*Chuan He,Zhanwang Deng,Zhaosong Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes low-rank orthogonalization method that leverages the low-rank nature of neural network gradients, leading to improved variants of matrix-signed gradient descent and Muon optimizer that outperform standard approaches in foundation model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network training involves large-scale matrix optimization, but the matrix structure of parameters has been overlooked. Recent success of Muon optimizer shows the importance of matrix orthogonalization, but it doesn't fully exploit the low-rank nature of gradients during training.

Method: Developed low-rank orthogonalization technique that explicitly leverages the low-rank structure of gradients. Built low-rank matrix-signed gradient descent and a low-rank variant of Muon optimizer based on this approach.

Result: Numerical experiments show superior performance of low-rank orthogonalization. Low-rank Muon achieves promising results in GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining, surpassing carefully tuned vanilla Muon. Theoretical convergence guarantees established.

Conclusion: Low-rank orthogonalization effectively exploits the inherent low-rank structure of neural network gradients, leading to improved optimization performance and better results in foundation model training compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Neural network (NN) training is inherently a large-scale matrix optimization
problem, yet the matrix structure of NN parameters has long been overlooked.
Recently, the optimizer Muon \cite{jordanmuon}, which explicitly exploits this
structure, has gained significant attention for its strong performance in
foundation model training. A key component contributing to Muon's success is
matrix orthogonalization. In this paper, we propose {\it low-rank
orthogonalization}, which explicitly leverages the low-rank nature of gradients
during NN training. Building on this, we propose low-rank matrix-signed
gradient descent and a low-rank variant of Muon. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of low-rank orthogonalization, with the
low-rank Muon achieving promising results in GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining --
surpassing the performance of the carefully tuned vanilla Muon. Theoretically,
we establish the iteration complexity of the low-rank matrix-signed gradient
descent for finding an approximate stationary solution, as well as that of
low-rank Muon for finding an approximate stochastic stationary solution under
heavy-tailed noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: USimUL framework uses uncertain similarity annotations with privacy protection to prevent label leakage while maintaining classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing similarity-based learning requires precise similarity annotations which can expose sensitive label information and create privacy risks.

Method: Proposes Uncertain Similarity and Unlabeled Learning (USimUL) with uncertainty components in similarity pairs, and develops an unbiased risk estimator for learning from uncertain similarity and unlabeled data.

Result: Theoretical proof shows statistically optimal parametric convergence rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior classification performance compared to conventional similarity-based approaches on benchmark and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: USimUL effectively mitigates privacy risks while maintaining strong classification performance through uncertain similarity annotations and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Existing similarity-based weakly supervised learning approaches often rely on
precise similarity annotations between data pairs, which may inadvertently
expose sensitive label information and raise privacy risks. To mitigate this
issue, we propose Uncertain Similarity and Unlabeled Learning (USimUL), a novel
framework where each similarity pair is embedded with an uncertainty component
to reduce label leakage. In this paper, we propose an unbiased risk estimator
that learns from uncertain similarity and unlabeled data. Additionally, we
theoretically prove that the estimator achieves statistically optimal
parametric convergence rates. Extensive experiments on both benchmark and
real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior classification
performance compared to conventional similarity-based approaches.

*Eliott Pradeleix,Rémy Hosseinkhan-Boucher,Alena Shilova,Onofrio Semeraro,Lionel Mathelin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Signature transform encoder for neural ODEs to handle non-Markovian dynamics, outperforming RNN-based approaches on synthetic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural ODEs rely on Markovian assumption which is often invalid in real-world systems with delays and memory effects. RNN-based encoders are discrete and struggle with continuous modeling.

Method: Use signature transform as encoder for learning non-Markovian dynamics in continuous-time setting. Integrate signature-based encoding into encoder-decoder dynamics models.

Result: Outperforms RNN-based alternatives in test performance on synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: Signature transform provides effective continuous-time alternative for capturing historical dependencies in dynamical systems.

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations offer an effective framework for
modeling dynamical systems by learning a continuous-time vector field. However,
they rely on the Markovian assumption - that future states depend only on the
current state - which is often untrue in real-world scenarios where the
dynamics may depend on the history of past states. This limitation becomes
especially evident in settings involving the continuous control of complex
systems with delays and memory effects. To capture historical dependencies,
existing approaches often rely on recurrent neural network (RNN)-based
encoders, which are inherently discrete and struggle with continuous modeling.
In addition, they may exhibit poor training behavior. In this work, we
investigate the use of the signature transform as an encoder for learning
non-Markovian dynamics in a continuous-time setting. The signature transform
offers a continuous-time alternative with strong theoretical foundations and
proven efficiency in summarizing multidimensional information in time. We
integrate a signature-based encoding scheme into encoder-decoder dynamics
models and demonstrate that it outperforms RNN-based alternatives in test
performance on synthetic benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A GNN framework with adaptive adjacency matrices using log-normal distributions and CV values for traffic flow forecasting, enhanced with weather factors and ACP for uncertainty quantification, showing improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic flow forecasting is challenging due to urban traffic stochasticity and environmental factors. Better predictions require models that can handle traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and complex interdependent factors.

Method: Proposed a Graph Neural Network framework with adaptive adjacency matrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation values. Incorporated weather factors (temperature, wind speed, precipitation) to adjust edge weights. Used Adaptive Conformal Prediction framework for uncertainty quantification. Validated with SUMO traffic scenarios and Monte-Carlo simulation.

Result: The model demonstrated better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds compared to baseline methods. Simulated mean travel time fell within intervals defined by historical data, verifying model robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN framework effectively addresses traffic stochasticity and environmental factors, providing accurate predictions with reliable uncertainty quantification, making it suitable for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.

Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting is essential for managing congestion, improving
safety, and optimizing various transportation systems. However, it remains a
prevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and
environmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of
accommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and
complex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency
matrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV)
values to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather
factors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights
and enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic
stations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to
adapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental
conditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP)
framework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target
coverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline
methods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then,
validate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying
Monte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under
Test (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of
the VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying
the model's robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional autonomous trading systems struggle to balance computational efficiency and market responsiveness due to fixed operating frequencies.

Method: Hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning with a meta-agent that analyzes market volatility and dynamically activates specialized Time Frame Agents for high-frequency or low-frequency trading.

Result: 25.17% cumulative return with Sharpe Ratio of 0.75 on AAPL stock (Jan 2024-May 2025), outperforming buy-and-hold AAPL (12.19%) and SPY (20.01%).

Conclusion: Dynamic hierarchical agents can achieve superior risk-adjusted returns while maintaining high computational efficiency compared to standard approaches.

Abstract: Conventional autonomous trading systems struggle to balance computational
efficiency and market responsiveness due to their fixed operating frequency. We
propose Hi-DARTS, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
that addresses this trade-off. Hi-DARTS utilizes a meta-agent to analyze market
volatility and dynamically activate specialized Time Frame Agents for
high-frequency or low-frequency trading as needed. During back-testing on AAPL
stock from January 2024 to May 2025, Hi-DARTS yielded a cumulative return of
25.17% with a Sharpe Ratio of 0.75. This performance surpasses standard
benchmarks, including a passive buy-and-hold strategy on AAPL (12.19% return)
and the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) (20.01% return). Our work demonstrates that dynamic,
hierarchical agents can achieve superior risk-adjusted returns while
maintaining high computational efficiency.

### [196] [Foundational theory for optimal decision tree problems. II. Optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12057)
*Xi He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm that generalizes beyond axis-parallel hyperplanes, showing superior accuracy and noise robustness compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimal decision tree methods are limited to hyperplane splitting rules and rely on external solvers. The authors aim to develop a general hypersurface decision tree algorithm without requiring external solvers.

Method: Building on algorithmic and geometric foundations from Part I, the authors develop a hypersurface decision tree algorithm that handles general polynomial hypersurface splitting rules. They test it on synthetic datasets with varying tree size, data size, dimensionality, and noise levels, and evaluate on 30 real-world datasets.

Result: The HODT algorithm recovers ground truth more accurately than axis-parallel trees and shows greater noise robustness. On real-world datasets, it achieves up to 30% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithms when tree complexity is controlled.

Conclusion: The proposed hypersurface decision tree algorithm successfully generalizes beyond traditional hyperplane splitting rules, demonstrating superior performance in both synthetic and real-world scenarios while maintaining interpretability and efficiency.

Abstract: Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks
due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal
decision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization
task. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is
NP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper
decision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four
formal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four
generic algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees
satisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties
of hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial
hypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed.
  In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the
algorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the
first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to
hyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on
general-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general
hypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers.
  Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision
trees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature
noise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more
accurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise.
We also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets,
showing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the
state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree
complexity is properly controlled.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NodePro is a node profiling framework that provides fine-grained diagnosis of graph ML model behavior by assigning interpretable profile scores to individual nodes, revealing systematic differences between models even when aggregate metrics are similar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluation metrics like accuracy obscure fine-grained differences in model behavior at the node level, making it difficult to diagnose when and where models fail on different subsets of nodes.

Method: NodePro combines data-centric signals (feature dissimilarity, label uncertainty, structural ambiguity) with model-centric measures (prediction confidence, training consistency) to assign interpretable profile scores to individual nodes.

Result: NodePro reveals systematic differences between models even when aggregate metrics are indistinguishable, generalizes to unseen nodes, and supports prediction reliability without ground-truth labels.

Conclusion: NodePro effectively identifies semantically inconsistent or corrupted nodes in knowledge graphs, demonstrating practical utility for fine-grained model diagnosis in real-world graph ML applications.

Abstract: Graph machine learning models often achieve similar overall performance yet
behave differently at the node level, failing on different subsets of nodes
with varying reliability. Standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy obscure
these fine grained differences, making it difficult to diagnose when and where
models fail. We introduce NodePro, a node profiling framework that enables
fine-grained diagnosis of model behavior by assigning interpretable profile
scores to individual nodes. These scores combine data-centric signals, such as
feature dissimilarity, label uncertainty, and structural ambiguity, with
model-centric measures of prediction confidence and consistency during
training. By aligning model behavior with these profiles, NodePro reveals
systematic differences between models, even when aggregate metrics are
indistinguishable. We show that node profiles generalize to unseen nodes,
supporting prediction reliability without ground-truth labels. Finally, we
demonstrate the utility of NodePro in identifying semantically inconsistent or
corrupted nodes in a structured knowledge graph, illustrating its effectiveness
in real-world settings.

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of ML climate models' performance under out-of-distribution scenarios reveals significant variability and limitations in handling climate change extremes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change is increasing unprecedented events that deviate from established patterns, making prediction of out-of-distribution events critical for risk assessment and climate adaptation. ML models show promise but their generalization under distribution shifts remains underexplored in climate contexts.

Method: Adapted established OOD evaluation methodologies to climate data and systematically evaluated state-of-the-art ML-based climate models across diverse out-of-distribution scenarios using large-scale datasets.

Result: Experiments revealed notable performance variability across different OOD scenarios, highlighting both strengths and limitations of current ML climate models in handling distribution shifts.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of robust evaluation frameworks and provide actionable insights to guide reliable application of machine learning for climate risk forecasting under changing conditions.

Abstract: Climate change is accelerating the frequency and severity of unprecedented
events, deviating from established patterns. Predicting these
out-of-distribution (OOD) events is critical for assessing risks and guiding
climate adaptation. While machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in
providing precise, high-speed climate predictions, their ability to generalize
under distribution shifts remains a significant limitation that has been
underexplored in climate contexts. This research systematically evaluates
state-of-the-art ML-based climate models in diverse OOD scenarios by adapting
established OOD evaluation methodologies to climate data. Experiments on
large-scale datasets reveal notable performance variability across scenarios,
shedding light on the strengths and limitations of current models. These
findings underscore the importance of robust evaluation frameworks and provide

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes gradient flow behavior near sparse saddle points in homogeneous neural networks and introduces a greedy training algorithm called Neuron Pursuit that adds neurons iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand gradient flow dynamics near saddle points in homogeneous networks and develop more effective training methods based on these insights.

Method: First part: theoretical analysis of gradient flow evolution near sparse saddle points. Second part: introduces Neuron Pursuit algorithm that iteratively adds carefully chosen neurons and minimizes loss.

Result: Gradient flow remains near saddle points for extended periods with small-norm weights converging in direction. Neuron Pursuit shows efficacy in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Understanding saddle point behavior provides insights for developing effective training algorithms like Neuron Pursuit, which demonstrates promising results through iterative neuron expansion.

Abstract: The first part of this paper studies the evolution of gradient flow for
homogeneous neural networks near a class of saddle points exhibiting a sparsity
structure. The choice of these saddle points is motivated from previous works
on homogeneous networks, which identified the first saddle point encountered by
gradient flow after escaping the origin. It is shown here that, when
initialized sufficiently close to such saddle points, gradient flow remains
near the saddle point for a sufficiently long time, during which the set of
weights with small norm remain small but converge in direction. Furthermore,
important empirical observations are made on the behavior of gradient descent
after escaping these saddle points. The second part of the paper, motivated by
these results, introduces a greedy algorithm to train deep neural networks
called Neuron Pursuit (NP). It is an iterative procedure which alternates
between expanding the network by adding neuron(s) with carefully chosen
weights, and minimizing the training loss using this augmented network. The
efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated using numerical experiments.

TL;DR: Guided CycleGAN with spectral normalization and identity-preserving losses outperforms autoencoders for unpaired face manipulation, achieving better realism and identity preservation without requiring paired datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's growing demand for realistic face synthesis and manipulation in entertainment and AI, but existing methods struggle with fine details and identity preservation when only unpaired, unaligned datasets are available.

Method: Uses adversarial learning with a guided CycleGAN framework incorporating spectral normalization for stable training, identity- and perceptual-guided losses to preserve subject identity, and landmark-weighted cycle constraints to maintain facial geometry across pose and illumination changes.

Result: Improves realism (FID), perceptual quality (LPIPS), and identity preservation (ID-Sim) over autoencoders, with competitive cycle-reconstruction SSIM and practical inference times. Achieves high quality without paired datasets and approaches pix2pix performance on curated paired subsets.

Conclusion: Guided, spectrally normalized CycleGANs provide a practical path from autoencoders to robust unpaired face manipulation, demonstrating effective identity preservation and realism without requiring paired training data.

Abstract: Human face synthesis and manipulation are increasingly important in
entertainment and AI, with a growing demand for highly realistic,
identity-preserving images even when only unpaired, unaligned datasets are
available. We study unpaired face manipulation via adversarial learning, moving
from autoencoder baselines to a robust, guided CycleGAN framework. While
autoencoders capture coarse identity, they often miss fine details. Our
approach integrates spectral normalization for stable training, identity- and
perceptual-guided losses to preserve subject identity and high-level structure,
and landmark-weighted cycle constraints to maintain facial geometry across pose
and illumination changes. Experiments show that our adversarial trained
CycleGAN improves realism (FID), perceptual quality (LPIPS), and identity
preservation (ID-Sim) over autoencoders, with competitive cycle-reconstruction
SSIM and practical inference times, which achieved high quality without paired
datasets and approaching pix2pix on curated paired subsets. These results
demonstrate that guided, spectrally normalized CycleGANs provide a practical
path from autoencoders to robust unpaired face manipulation.

TL;DR: This paper identifies critical issues in materials datasets and benchmarks for crystal structure prediction, including duplicate structures, improper dataset splits, and misleading metrics. It provides revised datasets and proposes new evaluation metrics to improve benchmarking standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address flaws in current materials datasets and evaluation methods for crystal structure prediction tasks, which can mislead model performance assessment and hinder progress in generative materials modeling.

Method: Critical examination of common datasets (carbon-24, perov-5) to identify issues with duplicate structures and improper splits. Provides revised datasets with duplicates removed and proper splits. Proposes new evaluation metrics METRe and cRMSE to replace problematic match rate metrics.

Result: Found that carbon-24 dataset contains only ≈40% unique structures. Identified issues with random splits in perov-5 dataset where polymorphs of different compositions are numerous. Developed fixed versions of datasets and new metrics that address these issues.

Conclusion: Proper dataset curation and appropriate evaluation metrics are crucial for meaningful benchmarking in crystal structure prediction. The proposed fixes and new metrics provide more reliable standards for assessing generative model performance in materials science.

Abstract: Generative models for materials, especially inorganic crystals, hold
potential to transform the theoretical prediction of novel compounds and
structures. Advancement in this field depends critically on robust benchmarks
and minimal, information-rich datasets that enable meaningful model evaluation.
This paper critically examines common datasets and reported metrics for a
crystal structure prediction task$\unicode{x2014}$generating the most likely
structures given the chemical composition of a material. We focus on three key
issues: First, materials datasets should contain unique crystal structures; for
example, we show that the widely-utilized carbon-24 dataset only contains
$\approx$40% unique structures. Second, materials datasets should not be split
randomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we
find to be the case for the perov-5 dataset. Third, benchmarks can mislead if
used uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the
structural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these
oft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions
of the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and
split by number of atoms $N$, and two containing only identical structures but
with different unit cells. We also propose a new split for the perov-5 dataset
which ensures polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more
sensible standard for benchmarking model performance. Finally, we present METRe
and cRMSE, new model evaluation metrics that can correct existing issues with
the match rate metric.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural representations in biological and artificial systems show importance of geometric and topological structures, inspiring the development of interpretable embeddings for event sequences.

Method: Uses simple additive recurrent structure to learn composable embeddings. Provides theoretical analysis of convergence to ideal additive structure. Introduces hyperbolic space variant for hierarchical data.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows learned representations converge to vector sum of constituent events (linear additive hypothesis). Hyperbolic model shows improved performance on hierarchical event sequences.

Conclusion: Event2Vec provides interpretable, composable embeddings for event sequences with theoretical guarantees, and hyperbolic geometry offers advantages for hierarchical data structures.

Abstract: The study of neural representations, both in biological and artificial
systems, is increasingly revealing the importance of geometric and topological
structures. Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for
learning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a
simple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable
embeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under
specific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a
Euclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the
representation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a
property we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of
Euclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our
model in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like
structures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our
hypothesis and demonstrate the benefits of each geometry, highlighting the
improved performance of the hyperbolic model on hierarchical event sequences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of searching for Pareto-efficient outcomes in high-dimensional utility spaces for complex automated negotiations, which traditional methods struggle to handle efficiently.

Method: Proposed utility graph decomposition algorithms that can efficiently handle high-dimensional utility graphs, tested on various utility graph topologies generated using state-of-the-art complex graph analysis methods.

Result: Achieved exponential speed-up for many structures, even with very large utility graphs. The approach can handle the largest utility spaces to date in terms of number of issues for complex interdependent negotiations.

Conclusion: The algorithms effectively bridge automated negotiation with preference elicitation literature by performing well across both value and comparison query types, demonstrating practical scalability for complex negotiation problems.

Abstract: This paper studies how utility graphs decomposition algorithms can be used to
effectively search for Pareto-efficient outcomes in complex automated
negotiation. We propose a number of algorithms that can efficiently handle
high-dimensional utility graphs, and test them on a variety of utility graph
topologies, generated based on state of the art methods for analysing complex
graphs. We show that we can achieve exponential speed-up, for many structures,
even for very large utility graphs. To our knowledge, our approach can handle
the largest utility spaces to date for complex interdependent negotiations, in
terms of number of issues. Moreover, we examine the performance of our
algorithms across two different types of elicitation queries from the
literature: value and comparison queries, thus making a connection between
automated negotiation and the preference elicitation literature.

### [205] [Statistical Model Checking of NetLogo Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10977)
*Marco Pangallo,Daniele Giachini,Andrea Vandin*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A methodology using Statistical Model Checking to automate statistically rigorous analysis of Agent-Based Models in NetLogo, reducing manual effort and providing statistical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABMs are complex and challenging to analyze through simulation alone. Current approaches rely on rules of thumb and experimentation that lack statistical rigor, taking time away from model improvement.

Method: Proposes MultiVeStA tool integration with NetLogo, drawing on Statistical Model Checking to automate analysis processes including replication count determination, warm-up period identification, run length specification, and parameter calibration.

Result: MultiVeStA dramatically reduces time and human intervention needed for statistically rigorous checks on ABM outputs. Successfully demonstrated with two NetLogo models, including novel application to statistically rigorous calibration.

Conclusion: The tool-chain makes statistical checks immediate for NetLogo models, promoting more rigorous and reliable ABM analyses while freeing analysts from time-consuming manual processes.

Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are gaining increasing traction in several domains,
due to their ability to represent complex systems that are not easily
expressible with classical mathematical models. This expressivity and richness
come at a cost: ABMs can typically be analyzed only through simulation, making
their analysis challenging. Specifically, when studying the output of ABMs, the
analyst is often confronted with practical questions such as: (i) how many
independent replications should be run? (ii) how many initial time steps should
be discarded as a warm-up? (iii) after the warm-up, how long should the model
run? (iv) what are the right parameter values? Analysts usually resort to rules
of thumb and experimentation, which lack statistical rigor. This is mainly
because addressing these points takes time, and analysts prefer to spend their
limited time improving the model. In this paper, we propose a methodology,
drawing on the field of Statistical Model Checking, to automate the process and
provide guarantees of statistical rigor for ABMs written in NetLogo, one of the
most popular ABM platforms. We discuss MultiVeStA, a tool that dramatically
reduces the time and human intervention needed to run statistically rigorous
checks on ABM outputs, and introduce its integration with NetLogo. Using two
ABMs from the NetLogo library, we showcase MultiVeStA's analysis capabilities
for NetLogo ABMs, as well as a novel application to statistically rigorous
calibration. Our tool-chain makes it immediate to perform statistical checks
with NetLogo models, promoting more rigorous and reliable analyses of ABM
outputs.

*Tinglong Deng,Hang Tao,Xinxiang Wang,Yinyan Wang,Hanjiang Luo*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach using AUVs with optical/acoustic communication and USVs as relays to provide reliable high-speed underwater diver communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater human activities are increasing but existing diver communication methods face challenges due to complex underwater environments and inherent disadvantages of current technologies.

Method: Uses multiple AUVs equipped with optical and acoustic multimodal communication as relay nodes, controlled by MARL for cooperative movement. USVs serve as surface relay nodes for coordination and data forwarding between AUVs and surface platforms.

Result: Through simulation verification, the proposed scheme effectively achieves reliable and high-speed communication for divers in underwater environments.

Conclusion: The MARL-controlled AUV/USV cooperative system provides adaptive, reliable high-speed communication services for divers, addressing challenges of underwater communication environments.

Abstract: As underwater human activities are increasing, the demand for underwater
communication service presents a significant challenge. Existing underwater
diver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and
complex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme
that utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and
high-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic
multimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive
communication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using
a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative
movement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can
be achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment
and wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to
coordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to
adaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality
communication between divers and surface platform can be achieved. Through
simulation verification, the proposed scheme can effectively achieve reliable
and high-speed communication for divers.

*Jonas Becker,Lars Benedikt Kaesberg,Niklas Bauer,Jan Philip Wahle,Terry Ruas,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MALLM is an open-source framework for systematic analysis of multi-agent debate components with 144+ configurations across personas, generators, paradigms, and protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent debate frameworks lack integrated evaluation, limited configurability, and are often designed only for tool use rather than comprehensive analysis.

Method: Developed MALLM framework with configurable agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols using simple configuration files and Huggingface dataset integration.

Result: Created a flexible framework with 144+ unique MAD configurations that enables systematic evaluation and comparison of multi-agent debate components.

Conclusion: MALLM provides researchers with a comprehensive tool to understand multi-agent debate components and their interactions through systematic analysis and evaluation.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) has demonstrated the ability to augment collective
intelligence by scaling test-time compute and leveraging expertise. Current
frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack
integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas,
response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce
MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that
enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144
unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert,
Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3)
discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g.,
Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate.
Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Huggingface dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro,
WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD
configurations. MALLM is tailored towards researchers and provides a window
into the heart of multi-agent debate, facilitating the understanding of its
components and their interplay.

*Jiangjing Zhou,Ovanes Petrosian,Ye Zhang,Hongwei Gao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Study on differential games with motion-payoff uncertainty using continuous Bayesian updating, showing belief convergence to true parameters and deriving Nash Equilibrium strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty in continuous-time differential games by developing a framework where players can continuously update beliefs about uncertain parameters through Bayesian methods.

Method: Proposed continuous Bayesian updating framework for belief revision, used theoretical proofs with probability theorems to demonstrate convergence, derived Nash Equilibrium strategies with continuous updating, and examined efficacy in pollution control games.

Result: Players' beliefs converge to true parameter values, ensuring stability and accuracy in long-term estimations. Nash Equilibrium strategies with continuous Bayesian updating were derived and shown to converge. Both continuous and dynamic Bayesian updating proved effective in pollution control games.

Conclusion: Continuous Bayesian updating provides an effective framework for handling uncertainty in differential games, with proven convergence properties and practical applicability in environmental control scenarios.

Abstract: This study investigates differential games with motion-payoff uncertainty in
continuous-time settings. We propose a framework where players update their
beliefs about uncertain parameters using continuous Bayesian updating.
Theoretical proofs leveraging key probability theorems demonstrate that
players' beliefs converge to the true parameter values, ensuring stability and
accuracy in long-term estimations. We further derive Nash Equilibrium
strategies with continuous Bayesian updating for players, emphasizing the role
of belief updates in decision-making processes. Additionally, we establish the
convergence of Nash Equilibrium strategies with continuous Bayesian updating.
The efficacy of both continuous and dynamic Bayesian updating is examined in
the context of pollution control games, showing convergence in players'
estimates under small time intervals in discrete scenarios.
