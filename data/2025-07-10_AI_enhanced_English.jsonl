We prove this structure is key to efficiency, enabling\nperfect generalization from few observed combinations. Evaluating pretrained\nmodels (DINO, CLIP), we find above-random yet imperfect performance, suggesting\npartial presence of this structure. Our work motivates stronger emphasis on\nconstructing diverse datasets for compositional generalization, and considering\nthe importance of representational structure that enables efficient\ncompositional learning.
