Specifically, we replace reward guided\ntest-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that\nmodulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework\nfor learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through\na tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model\nwhile optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach\nrecovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time\noptimization at a fraction of the computational cost.

However, regular graph machine learning\nmethods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental\nlearning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new\nknowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the\npreviously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to\nmaintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however,\ndo not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different\ntimestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns\ncan be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the\nnew data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic\nmixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a\nDyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming\ndata blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data\nsequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve\nold tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the\nnumber of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a\nsparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make\npredictions, significantly reducing the computation time.
