*Jiazheng Sun,Te Yang,Jiayang Niu,Mingxuan Li,Yongyong Lu,Ruimeng Yang,Xin Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fairy is an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant that addresses limitations of existing LMM-based GUI agents by enabling cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning through three core modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction act unilaterally, harming user experience.

Method: Fairy consists of three core modules: (i) Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks into sub-tasks from cross-app view; (ii) App-Level Executor that refines sub-tasks into steps and actions using long- and short-term memory with four core agents in dual loops; (iii) Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience into App Map and Tricks.

Result: Fairy with GPT-4o backbone outperforms previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7% and reducing redundant steps by 58.5% on the RealMobile-Eval benchmark.

Conclusion: Fairy demonstrates effectiveness in interaction and self-learning for mobile GUI agents, showing significant improvements in task completion and efficiency over existing methods.

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

### [2] [ToMPO: Training LLM Strategic Decision Making from a Multi-Agent Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21134)
*Yiwen Zhang,Ziang Chen,Fanqi Kong,Yizhe Huang,Xue Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToMPO algorithm enhances LLM strategic decision-making by modeling others' strategies and optimizing multi-level advantages, outperforming GRPO by 35% and larger models by 18%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM decision-making approaches focus on multi-round conversations but neglect strategic decision types and interdependence. Current RL methods fail to consider others' strategies during training.

Method: Proposed ToMPO algorithm that: 1) generates rollouts by reasoning about others' strategies, 2) estimates graph-level and sample-level advantages, and 3) balances global and partial rewards.

Result: ToMPO outperforms GRPO by 35% in model output compliance and cooperative outcomes, and shows 18% improvement over models 100x larger in size.

Conclusion: ToMPO effectively enhances LLM strategic decision-making capabilities by optimizing perception of others' strategies and game situation trends.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

### [3] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent behavior that detects errors in LLM-based agentic systems by analyzing execution traces rather than text matching, enabling systematic verification of behavioral patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current error-detection methods rely on fragile text matching of inputs/outputs, which fails due to natural language variability in LLM responses. There's a need for more robust monitoring of agent behavior independent of specific textual outputs.

Method: Uses temporal logic techniques from hardware verification to monitor execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions. Provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple execution scenarios for both development validation and regression testing.

Result: Demonstrated on a three-agent system solving multi-step reasoning tasks. When using capable models, all temporal assertions were satisfied. When smaller models were substituted, executions violated behavioral assertions due to improper tool sequencing and failed coordination, successfully flagged by the temporal expressions.

Conclusion: The approach effectively detects behavioral regressions in production agentic systems and provides a foundation for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability in critical applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

### [4] [LATTS: Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20368)
*Theo Uscidda,Matthew Trager,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LATTS is an adaptive test-time scaling method that dynamically allocates compute resources across generation steps based on local difficulty, improving accuracy-compute tradeoffs for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verifier-based methods increase computation uniformly across all samples and generation steps, leading to inefficient resource use without considering instance complexity.

Method: LATTS employs a verifier-based acceptance criterion at each generation step to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop generation, adjusting computational effort based on local difficulty.

Result: Empirical results show LATTS achieves significantly superior accuracy-compute tradeoffs compared to standard verifier-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LATTS approach provides an efficient way to improve LLM performance by adaptively allocating compute resources based on generation step difficulty.

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

Motivation: To develop ML models that respect philosophical concepts and values by design, promising new capabilities and better ethical alignment in AI systems.

Method: Reviews conceptual foundations, presents case studies on adopting PhIML as post-hoc tools or building it intrinsically into ML architectures, and analyzes challenges.

Result: Demonstrates philosophical gains and alignment through PhIML approaches, showing how ML practitioners can implement philosophical concepts in their work.

Abstract: Philosophy-informed machine learning (PhIML) directly infuses core ideas from
analytic philosophy into ML model architectures, objectives, and evaluation
protocols. Therefore, PhIML promises new capabilities through models that
respect philosophical concepts and values by design. From this lens, this paper
reviews conceptual foundations to demonstrate philosophical gains and
alignment. In addition, we present case studies on how ML users/designers can
adopt PhIML as an agnostic post-hoc tool or intrinsically build it into ML
model architectures. Finally, this paper sheds light on open technical barriers
alongside philosophical, practical, and governance challenges and outlines a
research roadmap toward safe, philosophy-aware, and ethically responsible
PhIML.

*Paris Koloveas,Serafeim Chatzopoulos,Thanasis Vergoulis,Christos Tryfonopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InsightGUIDE is an AI-powered reading assistant that provides structured, concise insights to help researchers navigate scientific papers, rather than replacing reading with verbose summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM tools often produce lengthy summaries that risk replacing the actual reading of source material, creating a need for tools that assist rather than replace the reading process.

Method: The system embeds an expert's reading methodology into its AI logic, using a prompt-driven approach to generate structured insights that serve as a 'map' to key paper elements.

Result: A qualitative case study shows InsightGUIDE produces more structured and actionable guidance compared to general-purpose LLMs, making it more effective for researchers.

Conclusion: InsightGUIDE serves as an effective reading assistant that provides concise, structured insights to help modern researchers navigate scientific literature more efficiently.

Abstract: The proliferation of scientific literature presents an increasingly
significant challenge for researchers. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
promise, existing tools often provide verbose summaries that risk replacing,
rather than assisting, the reading of the source material. This paper
introduces InsightGUIDE, a novel AI-powered tool designed to function as a
reading assistant, not a replacement. Our system provides concise, structured
insights that act as a "map" to a paper's key elements by embedding an expert's
reading methodology directly into its core AI logic. We present the system's
architecture, its prompt-driven methodology, and a qualitative case study
comparing its output to a general-purpose LLM. The results demonstrate that
InsightGUIDE produces more structured and actionable guidance, serving as a
more effective tool for the modern researcher.

### [7] [Reconstruction-Based Adaptive Scheduling Using AI Inferences in Safety-Critical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20513)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel reconstruction framework for adaptive scheduling in time-triggered systems that dynamically validates and assembles schedules from AI-generated or heuristic priorities while ensuring safety constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in time-triggered systems including message collisions, locked loops from incorrect precedence handling, and generation of incomplete/invalid schedules that compromise system safety and performance in dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes reconstruction models that systematically transform scheduling priorities into executable schedules with robust safety checks, efficient allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms for handling unexpected events like hardware failures and mode transitions.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across multiple performance profiles (makespan minimization, workload balancing, energy efficiency) show significant enhancement in system adaptability, operational integrity, runtime performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable solution for safe schedule generation in safety-critical time-triggered systems, enabling reliable and flexible real-time scheduling under dynamic and uncertain operational conditions.

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

### [8] [Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20520)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive online learning unit using Reinforcement Learning to overcome limitations of offline AI training for metascheduling in time-triggered architectures, enabling dynamic adaptation to unexpected events and complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline AI scheduling training faces challenges in constructing comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graphs that account for all possible scenarios like hardware failures and mode changes, which is resource-intensive and often infeasible.

Method: Integration of an adaptive online learning unit within the metascheduler using Reinforcement Learning models that continuously explore and discover new scheduling solutions, expanding the MSG and optimizing existing schedulers in real-time.

Result: The system becomes capable of handling unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more effectively, with RL models facilitating discovery of new solutions and optimization under stricter deadlines or new performance criteria.

Conclusion: Continuous real-time refinement through online learning ensures system flexibility, robustness, and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical environments by adapting to evolving demands and unexpected events.

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

### [9] [A Compound Classification System Based on Fuzzy Relations Applied to the Noise-Tolerant Control of a Bionic Hand via EMG Signal Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20523)
*Pawel Trajdos,Marek Kurzynski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fuzzy recognition system for EMG-based hand prosthesis control that detects contaminated biosignals using one-class classifiers and KNN ensembles to improve classification quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EMG biosignals for prosthesis control are highly susceptible to contamination, which significantly reduces classification quality and makes pattern recognition difficult.

Method: Two-ensemble system: one-class classifiers detect contamination in individual channels, and KNN ensemble recognizes patient intent, all using a coherent fuzzy model for uniform soft decision-making.

Result: Experimental evaluation using real biosignals showed the system's effectiveness, with comparative analysis of parameters and procedures that affect recognition quality.

Conclusion: The proposed fuzzy recognition system outperforms similar literature systems and effectively mitigates adverse effects of biosignal contamination in prosthesis control.

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

### [10] [SAMULE: Self-Learning Agents Enhanced by Multi-level Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20562)
*Yubin Ge,Salvatore Romeo,Jason Cai,Monica Sunkara,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAMULE is a self-learning framework that uses multi-level reflection synthesis to train a retrospective language model, enabling LLM agents to generate meaningful reflections by analyzing errors across micro, meso, and macro levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle with generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and reliance on rare successful trajectories, particularly in complex tasks.

Method: Proposes SAMULE framework with three-level reflection synthesis: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level), Intra-Task Learning (meso-level), and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level). Fine-tunes a retrospective language model and extends to interactive settings with foresight-based reflection.

Result: Extensive experiments on TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench show SAMULE significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines.

Conclusion: Well-designed reflection synthesis and failure-centric learning are critical for building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat
mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this
framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day

cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Development of a RAG system using LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware evaluation of radiotherapy treatment plans with interpretable outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an automated system for radiotherapy plan evaluation that is protocol-aware, interpretable, and minimizes hallucination while providing traceable outputs.

Method: Curated multi-protocol dataset of 614 radiotherapy plans across four disease sites. Built RAG system with three core modules: retrieval engine (optimized across five SentenceTransformer backbones), percentile prediction based on cohort similarity, and clinical constraint checker, all directed by LLM using multi-step prompt-driven reasoning.

Result: Optimized retrieval achieved perfect nearest-neighbor accuracy within 5-percentile-point margin and sub-2pt MAE. End-to-end testing showed 100% agreement with standalone modules on both percentile estimates and constraint identification.

Conclusion: Combining structured population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning is feasible for transparent, scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. System offers traceable outputs and robustness across protocols.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

### [14] [Parallel Thinking, Sequential Answering: Bridging NAR and AR for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20744)
*Qihang Ai,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework combining auto-regressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) models to improve reasoning tasks by using NAR for efficient intermediate reasoning and AR for precise final answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR models are slow for reasoning tasks requiring long chains of thought, while NAR models are fast but produce lower quality outputs. The goal is to leverage the strengths of both.

Method: Use an NAR model (like discrete diffusion) to generate intermediate reasoning traces efficiently in parallel, then guide an AR model with these traces to produce accurate final answers.

Result: 26% improvement over strong baselines with substantially reduced inference cost.

Conclusion: The hybrid AR-NAR approach effectively balances speed and quality in reasoning tasks, offering significant performance gains and efficiency.

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need effective memory systems to store observations and answer human queries about spatial locations, but current approaches lack principled mechanisms for efficient memory retrieval and integration.

Method: Proposes Meta-Memory, which constructs environmental memory representations and performs joint reasoning over semantic and spatial modalities to retrieve and integrate relevant memories for natural language location queries.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SpaceLocQA and NaVQA benchmarks, and successfully deployed on real-world robotic platforms demonstrating practical utility.

Conclusion: Meta-Memory bridges the gap in robotic memory systems by providing efficient retrieval and integration mechanisms, enabling robust spatial reasoning capabilities for robots in complex environments.

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

*Lipeng Ma,Yixuan Li,Weidong Yang,Mingjie Zhou,Xinyi Liu,Ben Fei,Shuhao Li,Xiaoyan Sun,Sihang Jiang,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogReasoner is a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework that enables LLMs to perform expert-level log analysis by structuring reasoning workflows and refining analytical granularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs struggle with structured reasoning workflows for log analysis tasks and lack the precision needed for expert-level troubleshooting. There's a need to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities to match expert cognition in system monitoring and failure diagnosis.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) coarse-grained enhancement using expert troubleshooting flowcharts to structure reasoning workflows, (2) fine-grained enhancement through task-specific fine-tuning and preference learning to calibrate reasoning details from mistakes.

Result: LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs on four distinct log analysis tasks using Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities for log analysis, enabling them to perform like experts through structured workflows and refined analytical granularity.

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

### [17] [DeFacto: Counterfactual Thinking with Images for Enforcing Evidence-Grounded and Faithful Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20912)
*Tianrun Xu,Haoda Jing,Ye Li,Yuquan Wei,Jun Feng,Guanyu Chen,Haichuan Gao,Tianren Zhang,Feng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeFacto is a counterfactual reasoning framework that improves multimodal language models by enforcing both accurate answering and faithful reasoning through three training paradigms: positive, counterfactual, and random-masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal language models often arrive at correct answers by relying on irrelevant or spurious image regions due to prior knowledge or dataset biases, indicating flawed reasoning despite correct answers. This highlights the need for better reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks.

Method: Proposes DeFacto framework with three complementary training paradigms: positive, counterfactual, and random-masking. Uses automated pipeline to localize question-relevant evidence and construct dataset variants. Trains models with GRPO-based reinforcement learning using three complementary rewards for accuracy and evidence-grounded reasoning.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that DeFacto substantially improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: DeFacto effectively addresses the reasoning fidelity problem in multimodal language models by jointly enforcing accurate answering and faithful reasoning through counterfactual training, leading to more interpretable and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

*Heming Zhang,Di Huang,Wenyu Li,Michael Province,Yixin Chen,Philip Payne,Fuhai Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GALAX integrates GNNs and LLMs via reinforcement learning with a Graph Process Reward Model to enable explainable subgraph reasoning for precision medicine target discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to fully integrate quantitative multi-omic features, topological context, and textual knowledge, limiting mechanistic interpretability in disease pathway identification.

Method: Proposes GALAX framework that combines pretrained GNNs with LLMs using reinforcement learning guided by GPRM, generating disease-relevant subgraphs step-wise with process-level supervision.

Result: Developed Target-QA benchmark combining CRISPR targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graphs for GNN pretraining and long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning towards reliable target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

TL;DR: An advanced LLM-based framework for mobile app review analysis that overcomes limitations of traditional star-rating systems and NLP methods by leveraging structured prompting and retrieval-augmented QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Star ratings fail to capture nuanced feedback in detailed review texts, and traditional NLP techniques struggle with contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and subtle linguistic features like sarcasm.

Method: Proposes a modular framework using large language models (LLMs) enhanced by structured prompting techniques to quantify rating-text discrepancies, extract feature-level insights, and support interactive exploration through retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA).

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, Spotify) show the LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses baseline methods with improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable insights in challenging review scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional review analysis methods and provides superior performance in extracting meaningful insights from complex mobile app reviews.

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AOT* is a framework that combines LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with AND-OR tree search to improve retrosynthesis planning efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step retrosynthetic planning faces computational challenges due to exponential search spaces and high inference costs, while existing LLM approaches have efficiency and cost constraints.

Method: AOT* integrates LLM-generated synthesis pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search, using atomic mapping of routes onto tree components, reward assignment strategy, and retrieval-based context engineering.

Result: AOT* achieves state-of-the-art performance with 3-5× fewer iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with efficiency advantages becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Conclusion: The framework enables LLMs to efficiently navigate chemical space for retrosynthesis planning, demonstrating significant improvements in search efficiency and competitive solve rates.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent benchmarks only evaluate final outcomes, ignoring critical aspects like safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness in real-world task execution.

Method: Propose a DFA-based framework that encodes tasks as valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior across diverse world models with five specific metrics.

Result: The method reveals significant performance differences between agents that appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides more comprehensive agent evaluation by considering execution patterns, safety, and efficiency, offering better insights into real-world agent performance.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

*Miao Li,Alexander Gurung,Irina Saparina,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrek is a new QA benchmark that tests LLMs' long-context reasoning using scientific articles, featuring complex questions requiring information synthesis across multiple full-text papers with contexts up to 1M tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current long-context benchmarks use non-scientific texts, focus on simple retrieval tasks, or employ artificial contexts, lacking evaluation of complex reasoning on real scientific content.

Method: Questions and answers are automatically generated via SQL queries over a database of article metadata, providing verifiable reasoning steps and scalable construction with minimal supervision.

Result: Experiments show SciTrek poses significant challenges as context length increases, with fine-tuning offering limited gains. Models struggle with numerical operations and precise information location in long contexts.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals systematic shortcomings in LLMs' long-context reasoning abilities, particularly for scientific content aggregation and numerical tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE is a neuro-symbolic framework that treats knowledge graph context construction as a sequential decision process, optimizing for accuracy, latency, and cost trade-offs through multi-agent coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like static k-hop expansions and "think-longer" prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable runtime, failing to balance accuracy with strict latency and cost targets while preserving provenance.

Method: CLAUSE uses Lagrangian-Constrained Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) to coordinate three agents (Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, Context Curator) for joint optimization of subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection under per-query resource budgets.

Result: On MetaQA-2-hop, CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth compared to GraphRAG. It yields higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and latency at equal or lower token budgets across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG.

Conclusion: CLAUSE produces compact, provenance-preserving contexts with predictable performance under deployment constraints, enabling per-query adaptation to accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs without retraining.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

*Samuel Schapiro,Sumuk Shashidhar,Alexi Gladstone,Jonah Black,Royce Moon,Dilek Hakkani-Tur,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a theoretical framework for evaluating combinatorial creativity in LLMs, focusing on novelty and utility rather than accuracy. It reveals scaling behaviors, optimal model architectures for creativity, and a persistent novelty-utility tradeoff that limits LLMs' creative potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for evaluating AI systems focus on accuracy and correctness, which are inadequate for assessing open-ended creative tasks like scientific idea generation. There's a need for new evaluation methods that capture the essence of combinatorial creativity.

Method: The authors developed a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating LLM outputs based on novelty and utility metrics. They conducted empirical studies to analyze scaling behavior, optimal model architectures, and the novelty-utility tradeoff across different model sizes and configurations.

Result: Key findings include: (1) specific scaling patterns for creative ability in LLMs, (2) optimal model depths and widths exist for creative performance within fixed compute budgets, (3) a persistent novelty-utility tradeoff that explains the ideation-execution gap, and (4) this tradeoff remains even at scale, suggesting limitations in LLMs' long-term creative potential.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in AI models. However, the persistent novelty-utility tradeoff indicates fundamental limitations in current LLM architectures for true creative potential, marking a new frontier in generalization research.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

*Haodong Zhao,Jidong Li,Zhaomin Wu,Tianjie Ju,Zhuosheng Zhang,Bingsheng He,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper challenges the hypothesis that persuasive efficacy in Multi-Agent Systems depends on model scale, proposing instead that cognitive processes and reasoning capacity are fundamental. It reveals a Persuasion Duality where reasoning models resist persuasion but become more persuasive when their reasoning is transparent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand persuasion dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems where LLMs and LRMs collaborate, challenging the prevailing scale-based hypothesis and exploring how cognitive processes influence persuasive behavior.

Method: Conducted multi-agent persuasion experiments, including complex transmission scenarios and multi-hop persuasion networks, to analyze resistance to persuasion and persuasive efficacy based on reasoning transparency.

Result: LRMs with explicit reasoning show greater resistance to persuasion but become significantly more persuasive when their reasoning process is shared. Complex networks reveal influence propagation and decay patterns in multi-hop persuasion.

Conclusion: A model's internal processing architecture directly influences its external persuasive behavior, offering new insights for the safety, robustness, and design of future Multi-Agent Systems.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recon-Act is a self-evolving multi-agent framework that improves web task execution by using a Reconnaissance Team to analyze errors and generate tools, and an Action Team to execute tasks with those tools, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VisualWebArena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal agents struggle with disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error when solving multi-turn, long-horizon tasks on real-world webpages.

Method: A two-team framework: Reconnaissance Team conducts comparative analysis of trajectories to generate generalized tools, while Action Team handles intent decomposition and execution using these tools in a closed-loop pipeline.

Result: Recon-Act achieves state-of-the-art performance on VisualWebArena, showing substantial improvement in adaptability to unseen websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: The reconnaissance-action behavioral paradigm with real-time tool generation creates an effective self-evolving system for web task automation, currently reaching Level 3 implementation with limited human intervention.

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TrustJudge is a probabilistic framework that addresses inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge evaluation systems through distribution-sensitive scoring and likelihood-aware aggregation, reducing score-comparison inconsistency by 8.43% and pairwise transitivity inconsistency by 10.82%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge evaluation frameworks suffer from critical inconsistencies including score-comparison inconsistency (where lower-rated responses outperform higher-scored ones) and pairwise transitivity inconsistency (circular preference chains and equivalence contradictions), which stem from information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments.

Method: TrustJudge uses two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities to preserve information entropy, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity.

Result: When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy across various model architectures and scales.

Conclusion: TrustJudge provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment without requiring additional training or human annotations.

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

Motivation: Current approaches use chain-of-thought data indiscriminately without understanding which data types most effectively enhance reasoning capabilities. The paper aims to identify and utilize high-value reasoning patterns to improve model performance.

Method: The authors define reasoning potential as the inverse of attempts needed to answer correctly, abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, create a core reference set, and use a dual-granularity algorithm to select high-value CoT data that aligns with valuable reasoning patterns.

Result: Using only 10B-token CoTP data, the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts model improved by 9.58% on AIME 2024 and 2025, and raised the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Conclusion: Selective use of high-value reasoning pattern-enriched data significantly enhances mathematical reasoning capabilities in large models, demonstrating that quality of reasoning patterns matters more than quantity of data.

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

*Kohsei Matsutani,Shota Takashiro,Gouki Minegishi,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework to analyze how reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) shape reasoning capabilities in LLMs by examining reasoning paths at trajectory and step levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how RL with verifiable rewards and SFT on reasoning traces actually shape reasoning processes in LLMs, going beyond simple accuracy metrics to analyze qualitative changes in reasoning paths.

Method: Developed a two-level analysis framework: trajectory-level (examining complete reasoning outputs) and step-level (analyzing reasoning graphs with nodes as individual steps). Applied this to models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains.

Result: RL compresses incorrect reasoning trajectories while SFT expands correct ones. RL concentrates reasoning functionality into fewer steps (steepens decay rates), while SFT homogenizes it across many steps (flattens decay rates). The analysis explains why SFT followed by RL training works well.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel reasoning path perspective that explains the success of two-stage training (SFT then RL) and offers practical implications for data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

*Wentao Zhu,Zhining Zhang,Yuwei Ren,Yin Huang,Hao Xu,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified approach inspired by mirror neurons to align representations between action observation and execution tasks using contrastive learning in a shared latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning methods treat action understanding and embodied execution as separate tasks, overlooking the fundamental interplay between them that mirror neurons reveal.

Method: Two linear layers map representations to a shared latent space where contrastive learning enforces alignment of corresponding observed and executed action representations, maximizing their mutual information.

Result: Experiments show the approach fosters mutual synergy between the two tasks, improving representation quality and generalization.

Conclusion: The simple mirror neuron-inspired approach effectively connects action understanding and execution through representation alignment, demonstrating improved performance over treating them as separate tasks.

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

### [31] [Distributed Specialization: Rare-Token Neurons in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21163)
*Jing Liu,Haozheng Wang,Yueheng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs process rare tokens through distributed specialization - coordinated subnetworks that emerge via parameter differentiation rather than discrete modular architectures, revealing a reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy with plateau neurons handling rare tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with representing and generating rare tokens which are important in specialized domains, but it's unclear whether they develop internal specialization through modular architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation.

Method: Systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families, examining influence hierarchy, activation patterns, spatial distribution, and training dynamics including weight correlation spectra.

Result: Discovered distributed specialization with three organizational principles: reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy (plateau neurons for rare tokens, power-law decay neurons, minimal contributors), coordinated activation patterns with reduced effective dimensionality, and universal accessibility through standard attention. Training shows gradual emergence through parameter differentiation with heavy-tailed weight correlations.

Conclusion: LLMs process rare tokens through distributed coordination within shared architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity, providing insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

### [32] [A Fano-Style Accuracy Upper Bound for LLM Single-Pass Reasoning in Multi-Hop QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21199)
*Kaiyang Wan,Lang Gao,Honglin Mu,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoQA, a multi-call framework for Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) that addresses LLMs' finite output capacity limitations by using capacity-aware task decomposition and active pruning of reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHQA requires sequential reasoning under noise, but LLMs have finite per-pass output capacity that makes single-pass reasoning unreliable when task complexity exceeds model capacity. The paper aims to overcome this bottleneck.

Method: The authors establish a Fano-style accuracy upper bound for single-pass LLMs and introduce InfoQA, a multi-call framework that combines capacity-aware task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces to keep information load within single-pass limits.

Result: Experimental results show that model behavior aligns with predicted capacity curves, and InfoQA achieves consistent performance improvements on a stringent noise-rich benchmark.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical principles for capacity-aware MHQA representation and demonstrates a practical framework that inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods.

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically document unprompted LLM agent behavior and establish baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error recovery, or extended autonomous operation.

Method: Continuous reason and act framework deployed across 18 runs using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google with persistent memory and self-feedback.

Result: Agents spontaneously organized into three behavioral patterns: systematic production of multi-cycle projects, methodological self-inquiry, and recursive conceptualization of their own nature. Patterns were model-specific with stable, divergent biases in self-evaluation.

Conclusion: First systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior provides baseline for predicting autonomous actions in deployed systems.

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

TL;DR: RCA is a novel framework that coordinates multiple LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and transparent explanations in disease prediction by developing deep data understanding through iterative rule refinement and distribution-aware reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML and LLM approaches struggle to balance accuracy with clinically meaningful explanations, often producing either accurate but unclear outputs or fluent but statistically unsupported narratives due to shallow data interaction.

Method: Proposes Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA) featuring iterative rule refinement from prediction errors and distribution-aware rules check based on global dataset statistics, using predictive accuracy to drive deeper comprehension.

Result: RCA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness with up to 40% relative improvement over 22 baselines on one private and two public datasets, while generating clear, logical, evidence-based explanations.

Conclusion: RCA demonstrates that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are mutually reinforcing outcomes, highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of VC-Agent for customized video dataset collection, with user studies verifying its usage in various real scenarios.

Conclusion: VC-Agent successfully expedites the video collection process by providing an interactive agent that can understand user queries and feedback to retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating semantic understanding in embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories, revealing significant performance gaps and trade-offs between modern embedding models and classical metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding beyond traditional benchmarks, as current benchmarks focus on isolated capabilities rather than comprehensive semantic understanding.

Method: SAGE evaluates semantic understanding through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human judgment tasks across 30+ datasets, assessing both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories: Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity, Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness.

Result: Evaluation of 9 embedding models and classical metrics revealed no single approach excels across all dimensions. State-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate in human preference alignment (0.682 vs. 0.591) but are outperformed by classical metrics on information sensitivity (Jaccard Similarity: 0.905 vs. top embedding: 0.794). Critical trade-offs were uncovered, such as text-embedding-3-small achieving highest clustering performance (0.483) but lowest robustness (0.011).

Conclusion: SAGE exposes critical limitations in current semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of model robustness for real-world deployment, highlighting the need for balanced evaluation across multiple dimensions rather than relying on single metrics.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

### [37] [A Theory of Multi-Agent Generative Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20408)
*Leo Maxime Brunswic,Haozhi Wang,Shuang Luo,Jianye Hao,Amir Rasouli,Yinchuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the first theoretical framework for Multi-Agent Generative Flow Networks (MA-GFlowNets), enabling multiple agents to collaboratively generate objects through joint actions with probability proportional to reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While single-agent GFlowNets use flow-matching loss to learn policies for generating objects proportional to rewards, no theoretical framework existed for multi-agent scenarios where agents need to collaborate.

Method: Proposes four algorithms: centralized flow network (centralized training), independent flow network (decentralized execution), joint flow network (centralized training with decentralized execution), and conditional joint flow network. Joint Flow training uses a local-global principle to train local GFNs as a global GFN.

Result: Theoretical guarantees that independent policies generate samples with probability proportional to reward function. Experimental results show superiority over reinforcement learning and MCMC-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MA-GFlowNets framework successfully extends GFlowNets to multi-agent settings with theoretical foundations and practical algorithms that outperform existing approaches.

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

TL;DR: FastEagle is a non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that generates entire drafts in a single forward pass, replacing sequential steps with a lightweight layer cascade to accelerate speculative decoding while maintaining competitive acceptance rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drafters like EAGLE require N sequential passes to propose N tokens, which limits the speedup potential of speculative decoding. The goal is to eliminate sequential dependencies in drafting to achieve faster LLM inference.

Method: FastEagle uses a non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits entire drafts in one forward pass, replacing temporal steps with a lightweight layer cascade. It employs layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation and uses a constrained draft tree for lossless verification.

Result: FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM, Alpaca) under both greedy and stochastic decoding, while maintaining comparable average acceptance lengths.

Conclusion: Removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration, as demonstrated by FastEagle's substantial wall-clock speedups over strong autoregressive drafters.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,

greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.
These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a

*Yiling Ma,Nathan Luke Abraham,Stefan Versick,Roland Ruhnke,Andrea Schneidereit,Ulrike Niemeier,Felix Back,Peter Braesicke,Peer Nowack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning parameterization (mloz) is introduced to model ozone interactively in climate models, providing high-fidelity ozone predictions 31x faster than traditional chemistry schemes and demonstrating transferability between different climate models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most climate models lack interactive ozone representation due to high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes, limiting accurate climate sensitivity simulations where ozone trends significantly modulate atmospheric feedback processes.

Method: Developed a machine learning parameterization that uses atmospheric temperature profile information as input to model daily ozone variability and trends across troposphere and stratosphere, including interactions with Quasi-Biennial Oscillation.

Result: mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31 times faster than chemistry schemes, contributing less than 4% of total model runtime, and successfully transfers between UKESM and ICON climate models without retraining.

Conclusion: The parameterization enables widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models lacking interactive chemistry, particularly for climate sensitivity simulations where ozone's role in atmospheric feedback processes is crucial.

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

TL;DR: A transformer-based autoencoder is proposed to anonymize EEG data by preventing subject re-identification while maintaining utility for machine learning tasks like sleep staging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing availability of EEG consumer devices raises privacy concerns about user data, as EEG signals can be used for re-identification and leakage of personal information.

Method: The authors use a transformer-based autoencoder to create anonymized EEG data that prevents subject re-identification but retains utility for specific ML tasks, evaluated on automatic sleep staging.

Result: The approach substantially reduces EEG signal re-identifiability while preserving its utility for machine learning applications.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively safeguards sensitive EEG data privacy without compromising its practical utility for EEG-based applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that memorization-based influence estimators can be adversarially manipulated through practical attacks that require only black-box model access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether influence estimation tools used for understanding model behavior and data attribution can be manipulated by adversaries, especially as these tools gain importance in data valuation and responsible ML.

Method: The authors develop a practical attack that calculates the pseudoinverse of input data to produce highly memorized samples, requiring only black-box access to model outputs with modest computational overhead.

Result: Empirical validation across multiple image classification tasks shows that even state-of-the-art influence estimators are vulnerable to targeted score manipulations. Theoretical analysis reveals conditions where memorization scores are inherently fragile.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution methods and suggest the need for robust defenses against such adversarial manipulations.

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

*Vivek Myers,Bill Chunyuan Zheng,Benjamin Eysenbach,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified approach combining contrastive representations and temporal distances for goal-conditioned RL that learns optimal goal-reaching distances even with suboptimal data in stochastic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between contrastive representations (which excel at stability and long-horizon capabilities) and quasimetric temporal distances (which enable free stitching), creating a method that gets the best of both frameworks.

Method: Proposes a representation learning objective that uses quasimetric distance parameterization with additional constraints to learn successor representations, enabling optimal goal-reaching policies.

Result: Improves performance on stitching tasks where contrastive learning methods struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where quasimetric network methods struggle.

Conclusion: The unified approach successfully combines the strengths of both frameworks, achieving better performance across different types of GCRL benchmarks.

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

*D. Darankoum,C. Habermacher,J. Volle,S. Grudinin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel end-to-end deep learning framework for EEG signal analysis that captures multi-scale frequency oscillations, models channel dependencies with attention mechanisms, filters noisy channels dynamically, and uses a combined supervised-contrastive loss for robust generalization across neurological disorders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals contain rich multi-scale information but face challenges in extracting meaningful features while handling noise and channel variability, which limits their diagnostic and drug development applications.

Method: Proposed framework includes: 1) Multi-scale frequency oscillation encoder, 2) Attention-based encoder for channel and temporal dependencies, 3) Gating network for dynamic channel filtering, 4) Novel loss combining supervised and contrastive learning.

Result: Validated across multiple CNS disorder treatments and disease diagnosis (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's), demonstrating ability to extract biologically meaningful patterns, autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed learning paradigm effectively addresses EEG analysis challenges through innovative architectural and loss design, showing promise for neurological disorder diagnosis and drug development applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

*Kishor Datta Gupta,Mohd Ariful Haque,Marufa Kamal,Ahmed Rafi Hasan,Md. Mahfuzur Rahman,Roy George*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTVAE is a rule-guided multimodal clustering framework that incorporates domain-specific constraints into VAE-based representation learning, using LLM-generated rules to produce more meaningful clusters than traditional similarity-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering relies only on input data similarity, failing to capture structural or semantic constraints critical in many domains. There's a need for clustering methods that can incorporate domain knowledge directly into the learning process.

Method: Extends VAE architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data features into a unified latent space. Uses LLM-generated rules structured into knowledge graphs, enforced through a loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and violation penalties.

Result: Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets show rule-guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful clusters (e.g., isolating UAVs, unifying stealth aircraft, separating SUVs from sedans) while improving traditional clustering metrics.

Conclusion: DARTVAE achieves more meaningful clustering than purely data-driven models by combining rule encodings with learned representations, though challenges remain with LLM rule hallucination, rule conflicts, overfitting risks, and computational scaling in complex domains.

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel algorithm combining sparsity and recurrent dependence to efficiently invert tree-structured matrices for attention layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quadratic scaling of memory and compute in attention layers by leveraging structural assumptions without the disadvantages of existing sparsity or recurrent methods.

Method: Proposes an efficient inversion algorithm for tree-structured matrices to combine the benefits of sparsity and recurrent dependence in attention mechanisms.

Result: The method aims to reduce computational complexity while maintaining effective sequence-to-sequence mapping capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm offers a promising approach to mitigate the quadratic scaling issue in attention layers by efficiently handling tree-structured matrices.

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning approach using auto-regressive U-Net and CNN to predict time-dependent full-field damage in concrete and forecast mechanical properties, enabling efficient analysis of aggregate effects on shrinkage and stiffness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational load of traditional full-field damage evaluations in concrete and gain insights into how aggregate properties affect shrinkage and stiffness, ultimately helping optimize concrete mix designs for improved durability.

Method: Uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to predict scalar damage field evolution given microstructural geometry and shrinkage profile, with CNN using damage estimations to forecast mechanical properties like shrinkage and residual stiffness.

Result: The dual-network architecture demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on synthesized datasets, successfully predicting damage progression and mechanical properties.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces computational burden while providing valuable insights into aggregate-property relationships, enabling optimization of concrete mix designs for better durability and reduced internal damage.

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

### [48] [Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20509)
*Luca Serfilippi,Giorgio Franceschelli,Antonio Corradi,Mirco Musolesi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO) as an alternative to entropy-based exploration in policy gradient methods, using a complexity bonus that balances stochasticity and structure rather than pushing towards uniform randomness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entropy maximization in policy gradient methods leads to uniform random exploration which can be inefficient. The authors aim to develop a more robust exploration strategy that encourages structured yet adaptable behaviors.

Method: Replace entropy bonus with complexity bonus defined as the product of Shannon entropy and disequilibrium (distance from uniform distribution). Implement this in CDPO, building on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework.

Result: CDPO shows greater robustness to hyperparameter choice compared to PPO, particularly in environments requiring extensive exploration. The method suppresses both extreme disorder and complete order, enabling discovery of useful non-trivial behaviors.

Conclusion: Complexity-driven regularization provides a more effective exploration strategy than entropy maximization, leading to better performance in challenging discrete action space tasks.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

*Oscar Leong,Yann Traonmilin*

TL;DR: The paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms in inverse problems, showing they can be interpreted as generalized projected gradient descent methods with convergence guarantees under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous recovery guarantees for diffusion-based inverse problem algorithms, which have shown empirical success but lack theoretical foundations.

Method: Develops a theoretical framework interpreting deterministic diffusion algorithms as time-varying projections onto low-dimensional model sets, with analysis under restricted isometry properties.

Result: Establishes quantitative convergence rates dependent on noise schedules and applies framework to uniform distributions over convex sets and low-rank Gaussian mixture models with global convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical foundation for diffusion-based inverse problem solvers, enabling rigorous analysis and convergence guarantees for nonconvex settings.

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

Conclusion: MDBench provides a rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework that accelerates advancement of model discovery methods by enabling systematic evaluation and improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical

levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic

### [51] [Understanding and Improving Adversarial Robustness of Neural Probabilistic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20549)
*Weixin Chen,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes adversarial robustness of Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs) and proposes RNPC, a robust variant that improves defense against attacks on attribute recognition models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NPCs offer interpretable predictions but their neural-network-based attribute recognition module remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can compromise final predictions by manipulating attribute outputs.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze NPC robustness and propose RNPC with class-wise integration for inference, ensuring robust combination of outputs from attribute recognition and probabilistic circuit modules.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows RNPC has provably improved adversarial robustness over NPC. Empirical results demonstrate superior robustness on image classification tasks while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs.

Conclusion: RNPC provides the first robust neural probabilistic circuit that effectively defends against adversarial attacks on the recognition module while preserving interpretability and performance.

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares two hybrid machine learning classifiers (XGBoost-Random Forest vs SVM-Logistic Regression) for diabetes risk stratification, showing XGB-RF consistently outperforms SVM-LR across internal and external validation with better generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide with projections to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit from machine learning, and the study aims to compare hybrid classifiers and assess their generalizability on external cohorts.

Method: Built two hybrid classifiers: XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and SVM + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR) using a leakage-safe standardized pipeline with encoding, imputation, scaling, SMOTE on training folds only, and probability calibration. Evaluated using threshold-independent discrimination (AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration metrics, with external validation on PIMA cohort using frozen pipeline.

Result: XGB-RF achieved superior performance (AUROC ~0.995, AUPRC ~0.998) on primary dataset and maintained strong external validation (AUROC ~0.990, AUPRC ~0.959) on PIMA cohort. SVM-LR performed lower (AUROC ~0.978/0.963, AUPRC ~0.947/0.875). XGB-RF showed smaller performance attenuation on external validation.

Conclusion: XGB-RF consistently dominated SVM-LR across internal and external cohorts with better generalizability. Gradient-boosting-based hybridization is a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk stratification, supporting prospective multi-site validation with clinical threshold selection.

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with
deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

*Mingze Yuan,Pengfei Jin,Na Li,Quanzheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIRF introduces a reward-based fine-tuning approach for diffusion models that directly optimizes physics constraints through trajectory-level rewards, overcoming limitations of value approximation methods like DPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often violate physical laws in scientific applications, and existing physics-informed approaches rely on error-prone value function approximations that cause training instability and inference inefficiency.

Method: Physics-Informed Reward Fine-tuning (PIRF) computes trajectory-level rewards for physical constraint adherence and backpropagates gradients directly, using layer-wise truncated backpropagation and weight-based regularization to improve efficiency and preserve data fidelity.

Result: Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently achieves superior physical constraint enforcement while maintaining efficient sampling compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Reward fine-tuning represents a promising direction for scientific generative modeling, with PIRF demonstrating the potential of direct trajectory optimization over value approximation approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the effects of hyperparameter choices on Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for uncertainty quantification (UQ) through global sensitivity analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BNNs promise accurate predictive modeling with uncertainty quantification, but in practice, obtaining accurate UQ is difficult due to complex hyperparameter choices that have opaque effects and interact with each other.

Method: The authors perform a global sensitivity analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings to understand how hyperparameters affect both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Result: The analysis reveals that many hyperparameters interact with each other to affect both predictive accuracy and UQ, making hyperparameter selection more complex than in traditional neural networks.

Conclusion: For improved BNN usage in real-world applications, global sensitivity analysis or related methods like Bayesian optimization should be used for dimensionality reduction and hyperparameter selection to ensure accurate uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

features and user experience. We propose a novel approach to QoE modeling in
video streaming applications using interpretable Machine Learning (ML)
techniques over raw time series data. Unlike traditional black-box approaches,
our method combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable
readout on top of compact frequency-domain features, allowing us to capture
temporal information while retaining a transparent and explainable model. We
evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy
in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.

### [57] [Explicit and Effectively Symmetric Schemes for Neural SDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20599)
*Daniil Shmelev,Cristopher Salvi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces stable, near-reversible Runge-Kutta schemes (EES) for neural SDEs that overcome instability issues of existing reversible solvers while maintaining memory efficiency and gradient accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for backpropagation through neural SDE solvers face trade-offs: discretise-then-optimise has accurate gradients but high memory costs, while optimise-then-discretise has constant memory but suffers from gradient approximation errors. Reversible solvers promise both but are often unstable.

Method: Develops Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes - a novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge-Kutta schemes that retain reversible solver benefits while overcoming instability issues under complex models and large step sizes.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate superior stability and reliability compared to existing methods, enabling memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model complexity.

Conclusion: EES schemes establish a practical foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs, offering both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy previously unavailable in a single approach.

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

*Su Ann Low,Quentin Rommel,Kevin S. Miller,Adam J. Thorpe,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Function encoders provide a principled connection between neural networks and kernel methods, enabling compact representations of function spaces with kernel-style guarantees and efficient training algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between neural network feature learning and kernel methods, creating scalable models that adapt to data structure while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Method: Developed two training algorithms: progressive training that constructively grows bases, and train-then-prune approach using PCA principles. Applied Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes techniques for generalization bounds.

Result: Achieved same accuracy with substantially fewer basis functions on polynomial benchmarks and nonlinear dynamical systems (Van der Pol oscillator, two-body orbital model).

Conclusion: Function encoders offer a path toward neural predictors with kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and principled at scale.

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

### [59] [MMG: Mutual Information Estimation via the MMSE Gap in Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20609)
*Longxuan Yu,Xing Shi,Xianghao Kong,Tong Jia,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for estimating mutual information (MI) using denoising diffusion models, showing that MI corresponds to half the gap in Minimum Mean Square Error between conditional and unconditional diffusion processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mutual information is a fundamental measure of relationships between random variables, but estimating it for complex systems is challenging. The recent success of denoising diffusion models in density estimation motivates exploring whether these methods can improve MI estimation.

Method: The method leverages the information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, where MI is calculated as half the integrated gap in MMSE between conditional and unconditional diffusion across all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios. The approach uses adaptive importance sampling for scalable estimation.

Result: The proposed method passes self-consistency tests and outperforms both traditional and score-based diffusion MI estimators. It maintains strong performance even when MI values are high.

Conclusion: Denoising diffusion models provide an effective framework for mutual information estimation, offering improved performance and scalability compared to existing methods while maintaining accuracy across various MI levels.

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

*Daehee Lee,Dongsu Lee,TaeYoon Kwack,Wonje Choi,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIL-C is a framework that maintains compatibility between incrementally learned skills and downstream policies without requiring retraining, using bilateral lazy learning-based mapping to align subtask and skill spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As skill repertoires evolve in Skill Incremental Learning (SIL), they can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies, limiting reusability and generalization of policies.

Method: SIL-C employs bilateral lazy learning-based mapping to dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space, enabling appropriate skill selection based on trajectory distribution similarity.

Result: Evaluation across diverse SIL scenarios shows that SIL-C maintains compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring learning efficiency.

Conclusion: SIL-C successfully addresses the skill-policy compatibility problem in incremental learning, allowing skill improvements to enhance downstream policy performance without structural adaptation.

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

*Matthias Chung,Deepanshu Verma,Max Collins,Amit N. Subrahmanya,Varuni Katti Sastry,Vishwas Rao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Twins is a unifying mathematical framework that creates hidden surrogate models in latent space for underlying equations, bridging representation learning and algorithmic solution methods. It demonstrates strong performance across ODEs, PDEs, and real-world geophysical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific machine learning has advanced separately in representation learning and algorithmic solutions. The authors aim to unify these parallel developments by creating a framework that bridges data-driven learning with classical scientific modeling.

Method: Latent Twins create surrogate models in latent space governed by operators, where classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation emerge as special cases. The framework is tested on canonical ODEs, PDE benchmarks (shallow-water equations), and real geopotential data.

Result: The framework provides compact, interpretable surrogates for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines like assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: Latent Twins offer scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that successfully bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines, establishing fundamental approximation properties for both ODEs and PDEs.

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

*Hanjiang Hu,Changliu Liu,Na Li,Yebin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to transform multi-turn task planning into single-turn reasoning problems, enabling efficient LLM agent training with dense rewards from expert trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLM agents for complex multi-turn task planning faces challenges including sparse rewards, credit assignment issues, and computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn settings.

Method: Proposes GRPO that converts multi-turn planning into single-turn reasoning problems, using dense and verifiable rewards from expert trajectories for policy optimization.

Result: A 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO achieves 70% success rate on long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps, outperforming baseline models up to 14B parameters.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient LLM agent training with strong performance and demonstrates cross-task generalizability where models trained on complex tasks can successfully complete simpler subtasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

*Yipu Zhang,Chengshuo Zhang,Ziyu Zhou,Gang Qu,Hao Zheng,Yuping Wang,Hui Shen,Hongwen Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PFedDL is a federated learning framework that enables collaborative fMRI analysis across sites without sharing raw data by decomposing site-specific dictionaries into shared global and personalized local components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data privacy constraints and site-specific heterogeneity in multi-site fMRI studies create non-IID data challenges that hinder generalizable model development.

Method: Performs independent dictionary learning at each site, decomposing dictionaries into global components (updated via federated aggregation) and local components (refined independently to capture site variability).

Result: Experiments on ABIDE dataset show PFedDL outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID datasets.

Conclusion: PFedDL effectively addresses privacy and heterogeneity challenges in multi-site neuroimaging studies while improving model performance.

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

*Giovana Morais,Magdalena Fuentes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether Audio LLMs truly listen to audio or rely on textual reasoning by using MM-SHAP framework to quantify modality contributions in music conversation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if Audio Large Language Models are genuinely processing audio content or primarily using textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest ambiguity in their multimodal capabilities.

Method: Adapted the MM-SHAP framework (performance-agnostic score based on Shapley values) to quantify relative contributions of audio and text modalities. Evaluated two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark.

Result: Found that higher-accuracy models rely more on text, but despite low overall audio contribution, models can successfully localize key sound events, indicating audio is not entirely ignored.

Conclusion: First application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs, providing foundational insights for explainable AI and audio research, showing models do process audio but text dominates predictions.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

*Yiyuan Pan,Zhe Liu,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CERMIC is a novel framework that enhances multi-agent exploration by calibrating intrinsic curiosity with inferred multi-agent context, filtering noisy surprise signals and generating theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards for better sparse-reward MARL performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing curiosity mechanisms in MARL confuse environmental stochasticity with meaningful novelty and exhibit uniform novelty bias, overlooking peer behavior novelty that encodes latent task dynamics, leading to suboptimal exploration in decentralized settings.

Method: CERMIC empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with inferred multi-agent context, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate exploratory behaviors via peer observation.

Result: Evaluation on VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2 benchmarks shows CERMIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in sparse-reward environments.

Conclusion: CERMIC provides a principled framework for effective multi-agent exploration by leveraging peer behavior novelty and generating information-gain-based intrinsic rewards, demonstrating superior performance in complex MARL settings.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning strategies to predict computational resources for chemistry simulations, optimizing runtime parameters like node count and tile sizes to minimize execution time or cost on supercomputers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help users avoid committing to expensive supercomputer experiments by predicting resource requirements beforehand, addressing both shortest-time and cheapest-run scenarios.

Method: Developed ML models using Gradient Boosting and active learning, trained on runtime parameter data from CCSD application runs on DOE Frontier and Aurora supercomputers.

Result: GB model achieved MAPE of 0.023 (Aurora) and 0.073 (Frontier) for execution time prediction; active learning achieved MAPE ~0.2 with only ~450 experiments.

Conclusion: ML-based prediction strategies effectively optimize computational resource allocation for chemistry simulations, with active learning providing efficient data collection for expensive experiments.

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive to prompt length, creating practical deployment challenges. The paper aims to provide theoretical foundations and practical tools for determining optimal prompt lengths.

Method: Develops a non-asymptotic lower bound linking minimal demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. Proposes a two-stage observable estimator with one-shot calibration for practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional priors.

Result: Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show close alignment between predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points, with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound. The calibrated variant further tightens this gap.

Conclusion: The results connect spectral coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic finite-sample regimes.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed

sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,

*Annabel Ma,Kaiying Hou,David Alvarez-Melis,Melanie Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bispectral Optimal Transport is a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that uses bispectrum representations to preserve signal structure while removing group action variations, achieving better class preservation than naive OT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard OT alignments based on pairwise geometric distances can ignore intrinsic coherence structure in symmetry-rich settings, failing to capture meaningful semantic correspondences.

Method: Extends discrete OT by comparing elements using their bispectrum representation - a group Fourier invariant that preserves signal structure while removing variation due to group actions.

Result: Transport plans computed with Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT on benchmark datasets with visual symmetries, capturing underlying semantic label structure while removing nuisance variations.

Conclusion: Bispectral OT provides a more meaningful correspondence method that better preserves class/content information by being aware of and handling data symmetries effectively.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that federated learning (FL) for fine-tuning LLMs still poses privacy risks, as attackers can extract training data from the global model, with leakage increasing with model size. The authors propose an enhanced FL-specific attack and evaluate mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations want to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs using their local data but are reluctant to share data directly. While FL is considered privacy-preserving, the paper investigates whether it truly protects against data extraction attacks.

Method: The authors conduct extensive experiments showing data leakage from FL-trained global models using simple generation methods. They introduce an enhanced attack that tracks global model updates during FL training to intensify privacy leakage.

Result: Results show that attackers can successfully extract training data from FL-trained global models, with privacy leakage increasing as model size grows. The enhanced FL-specific attack further intensifies data leakage.

Conclusion: FL for LLM fine-tuning has significant privacy risks. The paper provides practical guidelines for mitigating these risks through techniques like differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates, and safety-aligned LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the value of conditioning and metric learning approaches for robust drug-target affinity prediction, accelerating drug discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein

*Zhenpeng Su,Leiyu Pan,Minxuan Lv,Yuntao Li,Wenping Hu,Fuzheng Zhang,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CE-GPPO is a novel RL algorithm that preserves gradients from clipped tokens in PPO to better control entropy dynamics and improve exploration-exploitation balance in LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods like PPO discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to clipping, which overlooks their critical role in regulating entropy evolution during LLM training.

Method: CE-GPPO reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle, bounded manner by controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval.

Result: Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales and effectively mitigates entropy instability.

Conclusion: The proposed CE-GPPO algorithm provides better entropy control and exploration-exploitation trade-off, leading to improved performance in complex reasoning tasks for LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

### [72] [A Genetic Algorithm for Navigating Synthesizable Molecular Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20719)
*Alston Lo,Connor W. Coley,Wojciech Matusik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynGA is a genetic algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes to ensure synthesizability in molecular design, with custom operators and fitness functions for various tasks, and can be enhanced with ML-based filtering for state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the importance of synthesizability in molecular design by leveraging genetic algorithms, ensuring that generated molecules are practical and feasible to synthesize.

Method: SynGA uses custom crossover and mutation operators to constrain operations to synthesizable molecular space. It can be coupled with a machine learning-based filter to focus the building block set, and for property optimization, it integrates with Bayesian optimization as SynGBO.

Result: SynGA demonstrates effectiveness in synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization for both 2D and 3D objectives, achieving state-of-the-art performance when combined with block filtering.

Conclusion: SynGA serves as a strong standalone baseline and a versatile module for synthesis-aware workflows, being lightweight and enforcing synthesizability by construction.

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

### [73] [Scaling Laws are Redundancy Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20721)
*Yuda Bi,Vince D Calhoun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scaling laws in deep learning can be mathematically explained as redundancy laws, where the scaling exponent depends on data redundancy rather than being universal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous mathematical explanation for the origins of scaling laws, particularly the scaling exponent, which has remained elusive despite being a defining feature of deep learning.

Method: Using kernel regression to show that a polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields power-law scaling, and establishing universality across various transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations, and Transformer architectures in different regimes.

Result: The scaling exponent α = 2s/(2s + 1/β) depends on data redundancy (measured by 1/β), with steeper spectral tails accelerating returns to scale. The law holds universally across multiple scenarios.

Conclusion: This work provides the first rigorous mathematical explanation of scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations with theoretical foundations.

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

*Zhenshan Zhang,Xueping Zhang,Yechen Wang,Liwei Jin,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First study showing audio watermarking degrades spoofing countermeasure performance, with higher watermark density increasing error rates. Proposes KPWL framework to mitigate this domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio watermarking is widely used for copyright protection but its impact on anti-spoofing systems remains unexplored, creating a potential security vulnerability.

Method: Created Watermark-Spoofing dataset by applying diverse watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Proposed Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL) framework to adapt models to watermark-induced domain shifts.

Result: Watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs).

Conclusion: Audio watermarking represents a previously overlooked domain shift that compromises spoofing detection. The study establishes the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

### [75] [Measuring LLM Sensitivity in Transformer-based Tabular Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20768)
*Maria F. Davila R,Azizjon Turaev,Wolfram Wingerath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study analyzes how hyperparameter choices affect synthetic tabular data quality and computational performance in Transformer-based TDS tools, comparing GReaT and REaLTabFormer across different dataset sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models outperform GANs and Diffusion models for tabular data synthesis but have high computational costs, making them impractical for users with limited hardware. Understanding hyperparameter sensitivity can help optimize performance.

Method: Conducted sensitivity assessment across 10 model setups varying in architecture type and depth, evaluating runtime, ML utility, and similarity to real data distributions on four real-world datasets.

Result: Runtime is proportional to hyperparameter count, with shallower models faster. GReaT has lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer. Both tools work well on small datasets, but only REaLTabFormer maintains quality on larger datasets.

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs offers the best balance between data quality and computational requirements, though efficiency gains are limited compared to other TDS tools.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

### [76] [Sig2Model: A Boosting-Driven Model for Updatable Learned Indexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20781)
*Alireza Heidari,Amirhossein Ahmad,Wei Zhang,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sig2Model is an efficient learned index that minimizes retraining costs for dynamic updates through sigmoid boosting approximation, proactive update training with GMMs, and neural joint optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learned indexes perform well on static data but degrade significantly under dynamic updates due to expensive global retraining requirements that block queries and limit QPS.

Method: Three key techniques: (1) sigmoid boosting approximation for localized distribution adjustments, (2) proactive update training using Gaussian mixture models for strategic placeholder allocation, and (3) neural joint optimization framework for continuous refinement.

Result: Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS, and uses up to 1000x less memory compared to state-of-the-art updatable learned indexes.

Conclusion: Sig2Model effectively addresses the update performance limitations of learned indexes, making them suitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates while maintaining efficiency and bounded error guarantees.

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

*Gawon Lee,Hanbyeol Park,Minseop Kim,Dohee Kim,Hyerim Bae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid model combining MLPs and CNNs for multivariate time-series forecasting, addressing limitations of MLP-only approaches by capturing both long-term trends and fine-grained local patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time-series data exhibit non-stationarity with changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. MLP-based models excel at capturing long-term dependencies but ignore local variations like seasonal patterns and residual components due to their linear nature.

Method: Proposes combining MLPs (for modeling overall trends and long-term dependencies) with CNNs (for capturing fine-grained local patterns). Introduces IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that processes temporal dependencies channel-independently while considering inter-channel relationships through distinct layers, enabling large kernel sizes and reduced computational costs.

Result: Extensive experiments on time-series datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The hybrid MLP-CNN approach with IConv architecture effectively addresses the limitations of MLP-only models by capturing both global trends and local variations, resulting in improved forecasting performance for non-stationary time-series data.

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

*Abhishek Moturu,Anna Goldenberg,Babak Taati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiLAW is a lightweight method that dynamically adjusts sample loss weights based on difficulty levels (easy, moderate, hard) using only three learnable parameters, improving model performance in noisy and heterogeneous data environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep neural networks with noisy labels and data heterogeneity is challenging, requiring methods that can adaptively prioritize informative samples without excessive hyperparameter tuning or clean validation sets.

Method: LiLAW uses three learnable parameters to dynamically weight training samples by difficulty category. It updates weights via a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation set after each training mini-batch, without needing a clean validation set.

Result: Extensive experiments across various datasets, noise levels, loss functions, and architectures show LiLAW consistently enhances performance, even in high-noise environments, without heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization.

Conclusion: LiLAW provides a computationally efficient solution to improve model generalization and robustness in neural network training, demonstrating practicality across diverse settings including medical imaging.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

### [79] [Aligning Inductive Bias for Data-Efficient Generalization in State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20789)
*Qiyu Chen,Guozhang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI), a method to align State Space Models' inductive bias with task-specific spectral characteristics for improved data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale models face data scarcity issues, and fixed inductive biases in SSMs are inefficient when task structure doesn't match the model's prior. There's a need for more data-efficient learning methods.

Method: Formalizes SSM inductive bias through SSM-induced kernel analysis, then proposes TDI via power spectrum matching to align model frequency response with task characteristics before training.

Result: Experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks show TDI significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, especially in low-data regimes.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical and practical framework for creating more data-efficient models, addressing sustainable scaling challenges.

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

### [80] [FERD: Fairness-Enhanced Data-Free Robustness Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20793)
*Zhengxiao Li,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Siyuan Liang,Zhenghan Chen,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FERD is a fairness-enhanced data-free robustness distillation framework that addresses robust fairness issues by adjusting adversarial example proportion and distribution to improve worst-class robustness across categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-free robustness distillation methods overlook robust fairness issues, leading to severe disparity in robustness across different categories. The paper identifies two key problems: unequal robustness performance across categories and instability under different attack targets.

Method: FERD uses two main strategies: (1) robustness-guided class reweighting to synthesize more samples for less robust categories, and (2) generating Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) with uniformity constraints and Uniform-Target Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) with uniform target class constraints to provide balanced representation and avoid biased attacks.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show FERD achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness, improving worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack by 15.1% and 6.4% respectively using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: FERD demonstrates superior performance in both robustness and fairness aspects, effectively addressing the robust fairness gap in data-free robustness distillation by ensuring more balanced robustness across all categories.

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2I-Diff is a novel fMRI generation framework that uses time-frequency representations and classifier-free denoising diffusion to synthesize high-quality BOLD signals, addressing limitations of existing generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI data acquisition is resource-intensive, limiting high-fidelity samples for data-driven brain analysis. Existing generative models underperform due to overlooking complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.

Method: The framework converts BOLD signals to windowed spectrograms via time-dependent Fourier transform, trains a classifier-free diffusion model to generate class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, and reverts them to BOLD signals via inverse Fourier transforms.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved accuracy and generalization in downstream fMRI-based brain network classification tasks.

Conclusion: T2I-Diff effectively addresses the challenges of fMRI data generation by capturing complex temporal dynamics and spectral evolution, providing a robust solution for data-driven brain analysis.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench is a new large-scale benchmark for context-aware time series captioning, featuring real-world data from 11 datasets with 465k training and 105k test samples, including numeric series, metadata, charts, and captions generated via a scalable LLM pipeline with human verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series captioning benchmarks use synthetic data or simplistic captions, and neglect metadata and visual representations, creating a gap in real-world contextual understanding.

Method: Created CaTS-Bench by reframing 11 diverse datasets as captioning and Q&A tasks, using an oracle LLM pipeline to generate captions with factual checks, human indistinguishability studies, and diversity analyses, plus a human-revisited subset of 579 test captions.

Result: Established a comprehensive benchmark with tailored evaluation metrics, benchmarked leading VLMs, and identified their strengths and limitations in time series reasoning.

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench provides a reliable, extensible foundation for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation models, addressing current limitations in the field.

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

### [83] [Explaining Grokking and Information Bottleneck through Neural Collapse Emergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20829)
*Keitaro Sakamoto,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a unified explanation for late-phase training phenomena like grokking and information bottleneck through the lens of neural collapse, showing that contraction of within-class variance is the key mechanism underlying both phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind puzzling deep learning training dynamics like grokking (sudden test performance improvement after training loss plateaus) and information bottleneck (progressive discarding of irrelevant input information), which currently lack unified explanations.

Method: The authors analyze training dynamics through neural collapse theory, focusing on the contraction of population within-class variance and relating it to neural collapse measures on training data. They examine distinct time scales between training set fitting and neural collapse progression.

Result: The analysis reveals that the contraction of within-class variance is the unifying factor explaining both grokking and information bottleneck phenomena. The distinct time scales between fitting and neural collapse account for the late-phase behavior observed in training.

Conclusion: Neural collapse provides a unified framework to explain late-phase training phenomena, with within-class variance contraction serving as the key mechanism underlying both grokking and information bottleneck effects across various datasets and architectures.

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

### [84] [Shaping Initial State Prevents Modality Competition in Multi-modal Fusion: A Two-stage Scheduling Framework via Fast Partial Information Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20840)
*Jiaqi Tang,Yinsong Xu,Yang Liu,Qingchao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage training framework that shapes initial model states through unimodal training to address modality competition in multi-modal fusion, using Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) theory and FastPID for fine-grained information decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal fusion suffers from modality competition where one modality dominates learning, leaving others under-optimized. Existing methods overlook the critical impact of initial model states.

Method: Proposes ECS to quantify modality competition strength, uses mutual information as proxy for ECS, develops FastPID for partial information decomposition (uniqueness, redundancy, synergy), and implements asynchronous training controller to dynamically balance modalities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks by properly shaping initial states before joint training, effectively easing modality competition.

Conclusion: Shaping pre-fusion models' initial state is a powerful strategy that prevents competition before it starts, reliably enabling synergistic multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial

TL;DR: MOIRA is an early integration method for multi-omics data that handles missing modalities through representation alignment and adaptive aggregation, outperforming existing approaches on Alzheimer's Disease data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing modalities in multi-omics data hinder integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics datasets, limiting insights into complex biomolecular interactions in metabolism and disease.

Method: MOIRA projects each omics dataset onto a shared embedding space and uses a learnable weighting mechanism to fuse them, enabling robust learning from incomplete data by leveraging all samples including those with missing modalities.

Result: Evaluated on the ROSMAP dataset for Alzheimer's Disease, MOIRA outperformed existing approaches. Ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions, and feature importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior literature.

Conclusion: MOIRA provides a biologically relevant approach for multi-omics integration that effectively handles missing modalities, demonstrating practical utility in disease biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A masked transformer-based autoencoder for reconstructing missing fetal heart rate (FHR) signals to enable better AI-based risk prediction of neonatal breathing assistance needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Approximately 10% of newborns need breathing assistance, and FHR monitoring is crucial for detecting fetal risks. However, wearable FHR monitors suffer from signal dropouts due to maternal movement, limiting AI analysis capabilities. Traditional interpolation methods fail to preserve signal spectral characteristics.

Method: Proposed a masked transformer-based autoencoder approach that captures both spatial and frequency components of FHR data to reconstruct missing signals. The method handles varying durations of missing data and supports both signal inpainting and forecasting.

Result: The method demonstrates robustness across different missing data durations and can be applied retrospectively to research datasets. It enables better signal reconstruction compared to traditional interpolation techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed approach can enhance AI-based risk algorithm development and could be integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices for earlier and more robust detection of neonatal risks requiring breathing assistance.

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a causal perspective on conditional time series generation (TSG), introducing causal TSG as a new task family that extends beyond observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conditional TSG models learn observational correlations without considering unobserved confounding, limiting their reliability for simulation under interventions and counterfactual scenarios.

Method: Developed CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling using causal score functions derived via backdoor adjustment and abduction-action-prediction procedures.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show CaTSG achieves superior fidelity and supports interventional and counterfactual generation that existing baselines cannot handle.

Conclusion: The paper establishes causal TSG as a promising direction for more reliable simulation under interventions and counterfactual generation, with CaTSG providing an initial proof-of-concept.

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data is a major challenge in federated learning on electronic health records, especially when institutions collect time-series data at different temporal granularities with irregular sampling intervals.

Method: Proposes Federated Markov Imputation (FMI), a privacy-preserving method that allows Intensive Care Units to collaboratively build global transition models for temporal imputation without sharing raw data.

Result: FMI outperforms local imputation baselines on a real-world sepsis onset prediction task using MIMIC-IV dataset, particularly in scenarios with irregular sampling intervals across different ICUs.

Conclusion: FMI provides an effective privacy-preserving solution for handling missing data in federated learning settings with varying temporal granularities in healthcare data.

TL;DR: StyleBench is a comprehensive benchmark evaluating five reasoning styles across diverse tasks and models, revealing that no single style is universally optimal and strategy efficacy depends on model scale and task type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of LLMs is heavily influenced by reasoning strategies, but the interplay between reasoning styles, model architecture, and task type remains poorly understood.

Method: Introduced StyleBench to systematically evaluate five reasoning styles (CoT, ToT, AoT, SoT, CoD) on five reasoning tasks using 15 open-source models from major families ranging from 270M to 120B parameters.

Result: No single reasoning style is universally optimal. Search-based methods excel in open-ended problems but require large models, while concise styles achieve efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Smaller models often fail to follow instructions and default to guessing.

Conclusion: Reasoning strategy selection should be based on specific constraints, with strategy efficacy being highly contingent on both model scale and task type. The benchmark is open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in

TL;DR: A model-based RL framework that handles random sensor delays in POMDPs by using sequential belief state updates, outperforming delay-aware MDP baselines and showing robustness to delay distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL algorithms assume instantaneous environment perception, but real-world environments often have random sensor delays where observations arrive out-of-sequence, which hasn't been properly addressed in RL.

Method: Proposed a model-based filtering process that sequentially updates belief states based on incoming observation streams, incorporated into a delay-aware framework for model-based RL (applied to Dreamer).

Result: The method consistently outperforms delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs, demonstrates robustness to delay distribution shifts during deployment, and shows superior performance compared to common practical heuristics in simulated robotic tasks.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling observation delays is crucial for reliable RL performance in real-world delayed environments, and the proposed framework effectively handles random sensor delays in POMDP settings.

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

### [91] [Improving Early Sepsis Onset Prediction Through Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20885)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated learning approach using attention-enhanced LSTM for sepsis onset prediction that supports variable prediction windows and improves early detection without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early sepsis detection is crucial for ICU patient outcomes, but machine learning models are limited by data availability and privacy concerns. Federated learning enables collaborative training across institutions without data sharing.

Method: Proposed a federated, attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model trained on multi-centric ICU data with variable prediction windows instead of fixed windows.

Result: FL approach improves overall prediction performance (approaching centralized model performance) and is particularly beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Variable prediction window reduces computational overhead without significant performance loss.

Conclusion: The federated learning model with variable prediction windows enables effective early sepsis detection while preserving patient privacy and reducing organizational overhead.

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

*Ariadna Albors Zumel,Michele Tizzoni,Gian Maria Campedelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using mobility, crime, and sociodemographic data improves crime forecasting at fine spatiotemporal resolutions across four US cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if incorporating micro-level mobility features alongside historical crime and sociodemographic data enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.

Method: Used crime incident data, sociodemographic data from ACS, and human mobility data from 2019-2023 aggregated into 0.077 sq. mile grids. Trained a ConvLSTM network with 14-day and 2-day input sequences to predict crime 12 hours ahead, comparing against logistic regression, random forest, and standard LSTM baselines.

Result: Mobility features improved predictive performance, especially with shorter input sequences. Best results achieved when combining mobility and sociodemographic features, with the deep learning model achieving highest recall, precision, and F1 scores across all four cities. Longer sequences better for violent crimes, shorter sequences better for property crimes.

Conclusion: Integration of diverse data sources including mobility is crucial for spatiotemporal crime forecasting. Deep learning shows advantages (and limitations) when dealing with fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

### [93] [Distribution-Controlled Client Selection to Improve Federated Learning Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20877)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a distribution-controlled client selection method for federated learning that selects clients to align label distributions with either balanced or combined federation distributions, showing improvements for different types of data imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data imbalance among clients in federated learning decreases model performance, and existing client selection methods need enhancement to better mitigate the detrimental effects of both local and global data imbalance.

Method: Extension to existing FL strategies that selects active clients to align current label distribution with either balanced distribution or the federation's combined label distribution, empirically tested on three FL strategies and two datasets.

Result: Aligning with balanced distribution yields greatest improvements for local imbalance, while alignment with federation's combined label distribution is superior for global imbalance.

Conclusion: The proposed distribution-controlled client selection method effectively addresses different types of data imbalance in federated learning, with specific strategies performing better for local versus global imbalance scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

*Weili Zeng,Yichao Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flow matching suffers from instability in low-noise regimes where small input perturbations cause large velocity target variations, degrading semantic representations. The paper proposes Local Contrastive Flow (LCF) to address this pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental instability in flow matching frameworks that emerges in low-noise conditions, which causes optimization slowdown and degradation of semantic representations due to ill-conditioning.

Method: Proposes Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels while retaining standard flow matching at moderate and high noise levels.

Result: LCF improves convergence speed and stabilizes representation quality, effectively addressing the low-noise pathology in flow matching frameworks.

Conclusion: Addressing low-noise pathologies is critical for unlocking the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation learning, with LCF providing an effective solution.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

TL;DR: LEON is a method that uses LLMs as black-box optimizers to propose personalized treatment plans by leveraging domain knowledge from medical sources without task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized medicine needs to optimize treatments based on patient factors, but surrogate models fail to generalize to unseen patient-treatment combinations. Domain knowledge from medical sources can provide better fitness signals.

Method: LLM-based Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON) uses 'optimization by prompting' where LLMs serve as stochastic engines to propose treatment designs, contextualizing unstructured domain knowledge.

Result: Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing individualized treatments for patients.

Conclusion: LEON provides a mathematically principled approach to leverage LLMs for personalized treatment optimization, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

Motivation: To create a deterministic replacement for the stochastic denoising process in discrete diffusion models that requires no retraining or continuous state embeddings

Method: Derandomized generative reverse process using a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics to induce deterministic discrete state transitions

Result: Consistent improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation tasks

Conclusion: Deterministic reverse processes can be effective in discrete state spaces, enhancing the significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

TL;DR: FracAug is a plug-in augmentation framework for graph-level anomaly detection that generates semantic-preserving graph variants and uses mutual verification for pseudo-labeling to address data imbalance and labeling costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-level anomaly detection faces challenges with high labeling costs and dataset imbalance, which limit Graph Neural Networks' performance. Current heuristic methods are insufficient for capturing complex graph semantics.

Method: FracAug learns graph semantics and synthesizes fractional variants using a weighted distance-aware margin loss to capture multi-scale topology. It then uses predictions from original and augmented graphs to pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set.

Result: Experiments across 14 GNNs on 12 real-world datasets show consistent performance gains, with average AUROC, AUPRC, and F1-score improvements of up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18% respectively.

Conclusion: FracAug demonstrates remarkable universality and efficacy as a model-agnostic module that can be integrated with various GNNs to significantly enhance graph-level anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Binary Autoencoder (BAE), a novel autoencoder variant that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches to promote feature independence and sparsity across instances, addressing limitations of existing methods that produce dense features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for untangling numerical components from LLM hidden states rely on autoencoders with implicit regularization, causing dense features that harm sparsity and atomization. There's a need for explicit global sparsity guarantees across instances.

Method: Proposes Binary Autoencoder (BAE) that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches by discretizing hidden activations to 1-bit via a step function with gradient estimation for backpropagation. This promotes feature independence and sparsity.

Result: BAE enables reliable entropy calculation on binary activations for characterizing LLM inference dynamics and In-context Learning. It produces more interpretable features than baselines while avoiding dense features, confirming its effectiveness as a feature extractor.

Conclusion: BAE effectively addresses the dense feature problem in existing methods by enforcing global sparsity through entropy minimization, demonstrating superior feature extraction capabilities for interpreting LLM mechanisms.

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

Motivation: To enhance energy efficiency of linear actuators in heavy earth moving equipment (particularly excavator booms) by reducing energy loss in the form of heat and improving position control performance.

Method: Compared two hydraulic circuits: conventional PDCV vs. innovative PFCV with artificial leakage between actuator ends. Used PID controller tuned by fuzzy controller for position control. Conducted simulation using MATLAB/Simulink and experimental validation.

Result: The PFCV-based circuit achieved 8.5% higher energy efficiency than conventional PDCV circuit by bypassing extra pump flow during position control instead of using pressure relief valve.

Conclusion: The proposed PFCV approach significantly improves energy efficiency of linear actuators in heavy equipment, reducing environmental impact and operating costs.

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

### [100] [Lossless Compression: A New Benchmark for Time Series Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21002)
*Meng Wan,Benxi Tian,Jue Wang,Cui Hui,Ningming Nie,Tiantian Liu,Zongguo Wang,Cao Rongqiang,Peng Shi,Yangang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series models, establishing a direct link between compression length and negative log-likelihood through Shannon's source coding theorem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series evaluation tasks (forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, classification) primarily assess task-specific performance but fail to rigorously measure whether models capture the full generative distribution of the data.

Method: Introduces TSCom-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation framework that enables rapid adaptation of time series models as backbones for lossless compression. Uses Shannon's source coding theorem to establish equivalence between optimal compression length and negative log-likelihood.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets with state-of-the-art models (TimeXer, iTransformer, PatchTST) show that compression reveals distributional weaknesses overlooked by classic benchmarks.

Conclusion: Lossless compression serves as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation methods for time series modeling, providing a strict information-theoretic criterion for modeling capacity.

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

*Sarah Seifi,Anass Ibrahimi,Tobias Sukianto,Cecilia Carbonelli,Lorenzo Servadei,Robert Wille*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenFacts is a generative framework for creating plausible counterfactual explanations in multivariate time series data, outperforming existing methods in plausibility and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanation methods for multivariate time series often produce invalid, implausible, or unintuitive results, limiting their practical usefulness for model transparency.

Method: Uses a class-discriminative variational autoencoder with contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based initialization, and realism-constrained optimization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 18.7% in plausibility and achieves highest interpretability scores in human studies on radar gesture data and handwritten letter trajectories.

Conclusion: Plausibility and user-centered interpretability are more important than sparsity alone for creating actionable counterfactual explanations in time series data.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

*Haotian Guo,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExMoIRL is a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation, overcoming limitations of current phenotype-based and target-based strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phenotype-based strategies incur high experimental costs while target-based approaches overlook system-level cellular responses. There's a need to bridge this gap by combining both strategies for more effective drug discovery.

Method: Uses a phenotype-guided generator pretrained on drug-induced transcriptional profiles, fine-tuned via multi-objective reinforcement learning. The reward function fuses docking affinity, drug-likeness scores, ranking loss, prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization.

Result: ExMoIRL demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple targets. Generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells.

Conclusion: The unified framework showcases synergistic potential of combining phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective solution for de novo drug discovery.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

### [103] [Why Attention Fails: The Degeneration of Transformers into MLPs in Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20942)
*Zida Liang,Jiayi Zhu,Weiqiang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates why transformers underperform in time series forecasting, finding that attention mechanisms often degenerate into simple MLPs due to problematic embedding methods that fail to create a well-structured latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite transformers' success in NLP and CV, they often fail to outperform simple linear models in time series forecasting. The paper aims to understand the underlying reasons for this failure.

Method: The authors designed progressive experiments modifying transformers into MLPs to study attention mechanism impact, created an interpretable dataset to analyze attention failure, and conducted theoretical analysis of embedding issues.

Result: Transformer blocks frequently degenerate into simple MLPs in time-series transformers, and attention mechanisms don't function as expected due to flawed embedding methods that prevent proper latent space structure.

Conclusion: Current embedding methods are the root cause of transformer failure in time series forecasting, as they don't enable transformers to operate in a well-structured latent space, causing attention mechanisms to become ineffective.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

### [104] [Mechanism of Task-oriented Information Removal in In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21012)
*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Gouki Minegishi,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) through information removal, showing that LMs encode queries into non-selective representations and ICL selectively removes redundant information to steer models toward intended tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inner mechanism of in-context learning in modern language models, which remains unclear despite its effectiveness in few-shot learning.

Method: The authors use information removal analysis by applying low-rank filters to hidden states and measure selective information removal through carefully designed metrics. They also identify and ablate 'Denoising Heads' that facilitate this process.

Result: Few-shot ICL effectively simulates task-oriented information removal, selectively removing redundant information from entangled representations. Blocking denoising heads significantly degrades ICL accuracy, especially when correct labels are absent from demonstrations.

Conclusion: Information removal constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL, with denoising heads playing a critical role in selectively removing redundant information to improve task-focused outputs.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

### [105] [Decoupled-Value Attention for Prior-Data Fitted Networks: GP Inference for Physical Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20950)
*Kaustubh Sharma,Simardeep Singh,Parikshit Pareek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA) to improve Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) for high-dimensional regression tasks, achieving significant performance gains and computational efficiency over Gaussian Process inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFNs offer faster alternatives to Gaussian Process inference but show limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks with standard Transformer attention. The goal is to develop an attention mechanism that better mirrors GP properties while remaining kernel-free.

Method: Proposed Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA) that computes similarities from inputs only and propagates labels through values, mirroring the Gaussian-process update. The method uses localized attention and demonstrates that attention rule is more crucial than backbone architecture choice.

Result: DVA reduces validation loss by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases. PFNs with DVA provide 64-dimensional power flow equation approximations with mean absolute error of 1E-3, while being over 80x faster than exact GP inference. CNN-based PFNs perform at par with Transformer-based counterparts.

Conclusion: The crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the attention rule rather than architecture. DVA effectively captures GP properties while maintaining computational efficiency, making PFNs viable for high-dimensional regression tasks.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

### [106] [Predicting LLM Reasoning Performance with Small Proxy Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21013)
*Woosung Koh,Juyoung Suk,Sungjun Han,Se-Young Yun,Jay Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: rBridge enables small proxy models (≤1B) to effectively predict large-model reasoning performance by aligning pre-training objectives with target tasks using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-training large language models is prohibitively expensive, and current approaches struggle to optimize datasets for reasoning capabilities which only emerge reliably in larger models (>7B parameters).

Method: rBridge weights negative log-likelihood with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold labels to align small proxy models more closely with both pre-training objectives and target reasoning tasks.

Result: rBridge reduces dataset ranking costs by over 100x, achieves strongest correlation across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B-32B scale, and enables zero-shot transfer of predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B-7B scale.

Conclusion: rBridge provides a practical, cost-effective method for exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training by enabling small proxy models to reliably predict large-model reasoning performance.

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

*Zhengkang Guan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-CIT is a framework that reduces computational cost of conditional independence tests by partitioning data, applying base CITs to subsets, and aggregating p-values using stable distribution properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constraint-based causal discovery requires numerous conditional independence tests which are computationally expensive, especially with large sample sizes.

Method: Divide-and-aggregate strategy: partition data into subsets, apply base CIT to each subset, then aggregate p-values using novel method based on stable distributions.

Result: Reduces computational complexity to linear in sample size, achieves competitive performance, and shows improvement in complex testing scenarios on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: E-CIT provides an efficient plug-and-play framework that significantly reduces computational burden while maintaining theoretical consistency and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

### [108] [Alignment Unlocks Complementarity: A Framework for Multiview Circuit Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20968)
*Zhengyuan Shi,Jingxin Wang,Wentao Jiang,Chengyu Ma,Ziyang Zheng,Zhufei Chu,Weikang Qian,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MixGate introduces a function-aware alignment strategy for multiview learning on Boolean circuits, enabling effective self-supervised masked modeling by first establishing shared representations before applying multiview objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits faces challenges due to structural heterogeneity between different graph representations (like AIG vs XMG), which causes cross-view context to be perceived as noise in naive self-supervised approaches.

Method: MixGate uses a training curriculum with Equivalence Alignment Loss to first create a shared function-aware representation space, then applies multiview masked modeling objectives to leverage aligned views as complementary signals.

Result: Extensive experiments show the alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling from ineffective to powerful, with ablation studies confirming the importance of functional alignment as a precondition.

Conclusion: Functional alignment is essential for effective multiview self-supervision on Boolean circuits, and the proposed MixGate framework successfully addresses the structural heterogeneity challenge through its principled training curriculum.

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

*Honglin Zhang,Qianyue Hao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL fine-tuning enhances LLMs by increasing activation intensity and diversity, making information flow more redundant and flexible, while DPO shows weaker internal changes compared to PPO/GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why RL fine-tuning improves LLM capabilities beyond SFT alone, and investigate the internal mechanisms across different model families.

Method: Used edge attribution patching (EAP) to analyze internal differences in LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning across multiple model families.

Result: Found two robust effects: increased activation intensity (more engaged pathways) and greater diversity in activation patterns (higher entropy, less concentrated distributions). DPO showed weaker changes compared to PPO/GRPO.

Conclusion: RL fine-tuning systematically alters LLM circuitry by making information flow more redundant and flexible, explaining generalization advantages. Preference-based approaches like DPO differ significantly from online RL methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoRef, a benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) in geometric problems, which evaluates models' ability to localize geometric elements based on textual queries. The authors generate synthetic training data and show that GRPO fine-tuning with verify-and-regenerate mechanism significantly outperforms SFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric problem solving requires accurate diagram interpretation and cross-modal grounding, but current models struggle with identifying geometric elements from natural language queries. The foundational capability of geometric REC is underexplored.

Method: Created GeoRef benchmark from geometric problem corpora with diverse annotations. Generated large-scale synthetic training data using structured geometric formal language. Explored SFT and GRPO fine-tuning approaches, plus verify-and-regenerate mechanism for error correction.

Result: GRPO significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning with task-specific rewards. The verify-and-regenerate mechanism further boosts accuracy. Models trained on GeoRef show measurable improvements on downstream geometric reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: State-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with geometric REC, highlighting the need for explicit evaluation and strengthening of geometric grounding. REC serves as a crucial foundation for robust multimodal mathematical understanding.

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

### [111] [CLUE: Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20977)
*Hang Chen,Jiaying Zhu,Xinyu Yang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLUE is a novel LLM unlearning framework that uses circuit discovery and CNF transformation to precisely identify and target specific neurons for forgetting undesirable knowledge while retaining essential skills, outperforming existing localization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current localization-based unlearning methods treat neurons as an entangled group, leading to uniform interventions that risk catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure. There's a need to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting vs. retaining knowledge.

Method: Proposes Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning (CLUE) framework that: 1) identifies forget and retain circuits using mechanistic interpretability, 2) transforms circuits into conjunctive normal forms (CNF), 3) uses CNF satisfiability to determine neuron assignments (forget/retain), and 4) applies targeted fine-tuning strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments show CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and retain utility compared to existing localization methods through precise neural localization.

Conclusion: CLUE effectively addresses the limitations of current unlearning methods by providing a more precise and targeted approach to neuron-level intervention, enabling better balance between forgetting undesirable knowledge and retaining essential capabilities.

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDiff is a pipeline that efficiently identifies difficult math problems from existing datasets and trains a specialized generator to create new difficult problems at scale, eliminating the need for complex prompting and high API costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for automated synthesis of mathematical problems face challenges in scaling due to high computational/API costs, complex prompting requirements, and limited difficulty levels of generated problems.

Method: Uses an adaptive thinking model to identify difficult problems with a single forward pass, then trains a specialized difficult problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on the filtered data to produce new difficult problems at scale.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields 11.3% performance increase and achieves 65.9% average accuracy on multiple benchmarks, outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively transfers advanced reasoning capabilities without relying on larger, expensive teacher models, and demonstrates clear scaling phenomenon in model performance as difficult problem quantity increases.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we

### [113] [TyphoonMLA: A Mixed Naive-Absorb MLA Kernel For Shared Prefix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21081)
*Ahmet Caner Yüzügüler,Ahmet Çelik,Jiawei Zhuang,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TyphoonMLA is a hybrid attention mechanism that combines naive and absorb formulations to optimize both computational efficiency and bandwidth usage in MLA architectures, achieving up to 3.24x throughput improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLA decoding kernels use absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth but miss data reuse opportunities from shared prefixes due to compute-bound nature. A hybrid approach is needed to leverage both computational efficiency and bandwidth optimization.

Method: TyphoonMLA combines naive formulation (for compute-bound parts with shared prefixes) and absorb formulation (for non-shared parts to reduce bandwidth). This hybrid approach optimizes both computation and memory access.

Result: TyphoonMLA improves attention calculation throughput by up to 3x on NPU and 3.24x on GPUs, with only 3% overhead in HBM size compared to existing implementations.

Conclusion: The hybrid TyphoonMLA approach successfully addresses the limitations of existing MLA implementations by leveraging both naive and absorb formulations, achieving significant performance improvements with minimal memory overhead.

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

TL;DR: LCR is a practical learning-based GPU caching framework that enhances LRU with machine-learned predictions and adapts dynamically to prediction accuracy, delivering consistent performance gains while ensuring robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cache efficiency is a major bottleneck in GPU inference - embedding hit rates affect recommendation model throughput and KV-cache misses increase LLM time-to-first-token. Heuristic policies like LRU struggle with structured patterns, while existing learning approaches face limitations in robustness and overhead.

Method: LCR's core algorithm LARU enhances LRU with machine-learned predictions and uses online error estimation to dynamically adapt to prediction accuracy. It achieves near-optimal performance with accurate predictions and gracefully degrades to near-LRU performance with inaccurate predictions.

Result: Experiments show LCR improves throughput by up to 24.2% in DLRM scenarios and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3% in LLM scenarios, outperforming widely used inference systems while maintaining stable performance even under poor predictions.

Conclusion: LCR successfully bridges the gap between empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching, providing a practical framework that delivers consistent performance gains with robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

*Louis Van Langendonck,Guillermo Bernárdez,Nina Miolane,Pere Barlet-Ros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphUniverse is a framework for generating graph families to systematically evaluate inductive generalization in graph learning, addressing limitations of existing single-graph transductive benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph learning benchmarks are confined to single-graph transductive settings, lacking systematic evaluation of how models generalize to unseen graphs and handle distribution shifts.

Method: Generates graphs with persistent semantic communities while controlling structural properties like homophily and degree distributions, enabling controlled distribution shift experiments.

Result: Benchmarking reveals that strong transductive performance poorly predicts inductive generalization, and robustness to distribution shift depends on both model architecture and initial graph regime.

Conclusion: GraphUniverse enables systematic evaluation of inductive generalization and can facilitate development of robust graph architectures, including foundation models.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at

### [116] [Learning Ising Models under Hard Constraints using One Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20993)
*Rohan Chauhan,Ioannis Panageas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient estimator for the inverse temperature parameter of truncated Ising models using a single sample, achieving consistency in nearly linear time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging problem of estimating parameters in truncated Ising models, which are constrained probability distributions over hypercubes, particularly when the truncation set is defined by k-SAT formulas.

Method: The estimator is based on maximizing pseudolikelihood, generalizing recent techniques from previous works to handle truncated Ising models with bounded-degree graphs and k-SAT constraints.

Result: The proposed estimator achieves O(Δ³/√n)-consistency with the true parameter β* in nearly O(n) time, requiring k ≳ log(d²k)Δ³.

Conclusion: This work provides an efficient and consistent parameter estimation method for truncated Ising models, extending pseudolikelihood-based approaches to handle complex truncation constraints defined by k-SAT formulas.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

### [117] [Teaching RL Agents to Act Better: VLM as Action Advisor for Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21126)
*Xiefeng Wu,Jing Zhao,Shu Zhang,Mingyu Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VARL is a framework that uses vision-language models (VLMs) as action advisors for online reinforcement learning, providing action suggestions to improve sample efficiency without changing optimality or convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online RL is time-consuming due to massive interaction steps needed. VLA policies have limited low-level control performance and require task-specific demonstrations. VARL aims to leverage VLM domain knowledge to accelerate RL learning.

Method: VARL uses VLMs to provide action suggestions for RL agents instead of designing heuristic rewards. This approach increases sample diversity and improves sample efficiency, particularly in sparse-reward tasks.

Result: VARL greatly improves sample efficiency across diverse environments and agent settings without significant computational overhead. It enables direct application of RL from scratch in real-world environments.

Conclusion: VARL provides a general framework for online reinforcement learning that makes RL feasible in real-world settings by leveraging VLM knowledge while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

### [118] [LAVA: Explainability for Unsupervised Latent Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21149)
*Ivan Stresec,Joana P. Gonçalves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAVA is a post-hoc model-agnostic method that explains local embedding organization in unsupervised learning by analyzing feature correlations within latent space neighborhoods and identifying recurring patterns across the entire embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised black-box models are difficult to interpret, especially when they produce multi-dimensional latent embeddings without clear mapping functions. Current explainability methods for unsupervised learning provide either overly granular single-sample explanations or overly reductive dataset-wide summaries, lacking automated strategies to relate similar samples based on latent proximity.

Method: LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities (neighborhoods) described by correlations between original input features. It then identifies recurring patterns of correlations across the entire latent space, making it particularly suitable for manifold learning methods that only provide relative spatial organization of embeddings.

Result: Applied to UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney dataset, LAVA successfully captures relevant feature associations and identifies visually and biologically meaningful local patterns that are shared among seemingly distant regions of the latent spaces.

Conclusion: LAVA provides an effective approach for explaining local embedding organization in unsupervised learning, bridging the gap between overly fine-grained and overly reductive explanations by leveraging latent space neighborhoods and recurring correlation patterns.

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Local-UID, a parsimonious identifier scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring for Graph Neural Networks to solve Integer Linear Programs, achieving Global-UID expressive power with better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard anonymous GNNs lack expressiveness for ILPs, while Global-UIDs introduce spurious correlations that harm generalization, creating a tradeoff that needs addressing.

Method: Proposes Local-UID scheme using d-hop uniqueness coloring, introduces ColorGNN with color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID as a lightweight variant.

Result: Substantial gains on three ILP benchmarks, strong OOD generalization on linear programming datasets, and improvements on general graph-level tasks when combined with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Local-UIDs achieve the expressive power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization, providing an effective solution for ILP optimization with GNNs.

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

*Michael Sullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial process reward model (PRM) theoretically and empirically, identifies a flaw in GRPO objective, proposes λ-GRPO modification, and shows it outperforms standard GRPO with better validation accuracy and reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question the need for costly explicit PRMs in GRPO by leveraging the hidden built-in PRM structure within vanilla GRPO to improve model performance with minimal training cost impact.

Method: Theoretical proof of GRPO inducing non-trivial PRM under token sequence overlap assumptions, empirical validation of assumptions, identification of GRPO objective flaw (non-uniform process step distribution), and proposal of λ-GRPO modification.

Result: LLMs trained with λ-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy and downstream reasoning task performance, reaching peak performance more rapidly than standard GRPO.

Conclusion: The built-in PRM structure in vanilla GRPO can be leveraged to boost performance without costly explicit PRMs, challenging the advantage of expensive PRM definitions for GRPO.

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeRCD is a novel foundation model for time series anomaly detection that uses Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD) paradigm instead of reconstruction-based methods, achieving superior zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of reconstruction-based foundation models which struggle with subtle anomalies and complex normal patterns, leading to high false positive/negative rates.

Method: Uses Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD) paradigm - trains model to detect discrepancies between adjacent time windows rather than reconstruct inputs. Implemented with Transformer architecture and pre-trained on large-scale synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot time series anomaly detection across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: RCD paradigm establishes a new effective path for building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

TL;DR: MAIFormer is a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories using attention mechanisms to capture individual aircraft behaviors and social interactions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential for air traffic management but challenging due to difficulties in modeling individual behaviors and complex interactions between flights, as well as generating explainable predictions.

Method: Proposes Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer (MAIFormer) with two key attention modules: masked multivariate attention for spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and agent attention for social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes.

Result: MAIFormer achieves best performance across multiple metrics on real-world ADS-B flight trajectory data from Incheon International Airport, outperforming other methods while producing interpretable predictions.

Conclusion: MAIFormer provides both accurate trajectory predictions and interpretable outcomes that improve model transparency and practical utility in air traffic control applications.

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tree-GRPO is a tree-based grouped agent RL method that addresses sparse supervision in long-term multi-turn agent tasks by using tree search to increase rollouts and create step-wise process supervision from outcome rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for LLM agents suffer from sparse supervision in long-term multi-turn tasks when driven solely by outcome rewards.

Method: Tree-GRPO uses tree search where nodes represent agent interaction steps, shares common prefixes to increase rollouts, and estimates grouped relative advantages at intra-tree and inter-tree levels.

Result: Experiments on 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks show superiority over chain-based RL methods.

Conclusion: Tree-based RL with grouped relative policy optimization effectively addresses sparse supervision and outperforms traditional chain-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

Motivation: Understanding how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning changes LLMs' structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge that needs interpretable explanation methods.

Method: Developed BioToolKG (bioinformatics knowledge graph) and CFFTLLMExplainer that learns soft masks over graph nodes/edges to generate minimal structural perturbations causing maximum semantic divergence, with joint optimization of structural sparsity and semantic divergence.

Result: Applied to fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM, counterfactual masking exposed model's structural dependencies and aligned with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.

Conclusion: The framework provides insights into fine-tuned LLMs' internal mechanisms and highlights counterfactual graphs as a tool for interpretable AI.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution threatens public health and environmental sustainability, but current forecasting methods are limited by complex multi-pollutant interactions, evolving meteorological conditions, and spatial heterogeneity across monitoring stations.

Method: AirPCM employs a unified architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality, enabling fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying geographic and temporal scales.

Result: Extensive evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy and generalization capability, including handling sudden pollution episodes.

Conclusion: AirPCM's long-term forecasting capability provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based

*Madeleine Dwyer,Adam Sobey,Adriane Chapman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSPO (Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation) is a new RL method that smooths policy probabilities toward old policies instead of using ratio clipping, improving training stability while preserving gradient information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods like PPO and GRPO rely on ratio clipping to stabilize updates, but this discards information and creates gradient discontinuities. PSPO aims to address these limitations.

Method: PSPO smooths the current policy's probabilities toward the old behavior policy before computing importance ratios, creating a soft trust region that prevents large destabilizing updates while maintaining gradient continuity.

Result: GR-PSPO (PSPO applied to GRPO) achieved over 20% performance improvement on GSM8K compared to clipped GRPO (39.7% vs 17.6% for 0.5B model, 59.4% vs 37.8% for 1.5B model), with clearer and more logical reasoning outputs.

Conclusion: PSPO provides a superior alternative to ratio clipping by preserving gradient signals while maintaining training stability, leading to substantial performance improvements in language model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

*Yiyou Sun,Yuhan Cao,Pohao Huang,Haoyue Bai,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Nouha Dziri,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DELTA-Code is a synthetic coding benchmark that tests whether LLMs can learn new reasoning strategies through RL, showing a grokking phase transition from zero to near-perfect accuracy after extended training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can acquire genuinely new reasoning skills beyond their pre-training, by testing learnability (solving previously unsolvable problems) and transferability (generalizing to out-of-distribution problems).

Method: Created controlled synthetic coding problems with templated generators, used RL training with techniques like staged warm-up, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop.

Result: Models showed a grokking phase transition - extended zero reward period followed by abrupt near-perfect accuracy. Solid gains within families and recomposed skills, but weak transformative generalization.

Conclusion: DELTA provides a clean testbed for probing RL-driven reasoning limits and understanding how models can acquire new algorithmic skills beyond existing priors.

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

*Yehonatan Refael,Guy Smorodinsky,Ofir Lindenbaum,Itay Safran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the limitations of neural network training data reconstruction attacks, proving that without prior knowledge, there are infinitely many alternative solutions far from the true training data, making reconstruction fundamentally unreliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about privacy and security from neural network memorization, and to understand the reliability of existing reconstruction attacks that exploit implicit bias toward margin maximization.

Method: The authors take a complementary perspective by analyzing weaknesses of existing reconstruction methods, rigorously proving theoretical limitations and empirically demonstrating that exact duplication occurs only by chance.

Result: Proved that without prior knowledge, reconstruction is fundamentally unreliable with infinitely many alternative solutions; showed that more extensively trained networks (satisfying implicit bias more strongly) are actually less susceptible to reconstruction attacks.

Conclusion: The results refine theoretical understanding of training set leakage conditions and offer insights for mitigating reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need for strong generalization.

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

### [129] [Actor-Critic without Actor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21022)
*Donghyeon Ki,Hee-Jun Ahn,Kyungyoon Kim,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Actor-Critic without Actor (ACA) is a lightweight RL framework that eliminates the explicit actor network and generates actions directly from the critic's gradient field, removing actor training overhead while maintaining multi-modal behavior capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard actor-critic methods require separate actor and critic networks, making training complex and limiting scalability. Diffusion models offer expressive policies but introduce design complexity and computational burdens.

Method: ACA generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level critic instead of using an explicit actor network, keeping policy improvement aligned with the critic's latest value estimates.

Result: ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and competitive performance compared to standard actor-critic and state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods on standard online RL benchmarks.

Conclusion: ACA provides a simple yet powerful solution for online RL by combining simplicity with expressiveness, eliminating actor training overhead while retaining the ability to capture diverse behaviors.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

### [130] [FORCE: Transferable Visual Jailbreaking Attacks via Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21029)
*Runqi Lin,Alasdair Paren,Suqin Yuan,Muyang Li,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes visual jailbreaking attacks on multimodal large language models (MLLMs), finding they have limited cross-model transferability due to high-sharpness loss landscapes. The authors propose FORCE method to improve transferability by correcting feature over-reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual jailbreaking attacks can easily manipulate open-source MLLMs but fail to transfer to closed-source models due to high sensitivity to parameter changes, limiting vulnerability assessment capabilities.

Method: FORCE (Feature Over-Reliance Correction) method guides attacks to explore broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales frequency feature influence based on semantic content, eliminating non-generalizable feature dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments show FORCE effectively improves cross-model transferability of visual jailbreaking attacks, enabling better red-teaming evaluations against closed-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: By correcting feature over-reliance in both layer representations and spectral domains, FORCE discovers flattened feasible regions that enhance the transferability and practical utility of visual jailbreaking attacks for security assessment.

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

Motivation: To build efficient learning systems that reach desired error thresholds with minimal observations by establishing a fundamental theoretical foundation for learning algorithms.

Method: Deriving classic learning algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation, and the Adam optimizer from first principles using a Learning Lagrangian framework where learning searches for stationary paths.

Result: Successfully derived multiple learning algorithms including reinforcement learning's Bellman equation and generative model optimizers from the unified Lagrangian framework.

Conclusion: Learning algorithms can be systematically derived by seeking stationary trajectories in the Learning Lagrangian, providing a physics-inspired foundation for efficient learning systems.

Abstract: We study the problem of building an efficient learning system. Efficient
learning processes information in the least time, i.e., building a system that
reaches a desired error threshold with the least number of observations.
Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning
algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the
Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning

in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the
stationary trajectories.

TL;DR: SPREAD is a generative framework using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for efficient multi-objective optimization, combining adaptive gradient descent updates with diversity mechanisms to compute Pareto fronts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods for large-scale and expensive problems, particularly for computing Pareto sets of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives.

Method: SPREAD learns a conditional diffusion process over decision space points, then refines candidates at each reverse diffusion step using adaptive multiple gradient descent-inspired updates for fast convergence and Gaussian RBF-based repulsion for diversity.

Result: Empirical results on multi-objective optimization benchmarks (including offline and Bayesian surrogate-based settings) show SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

Conclusion: SPREAD provides an effective generative framework for multi-objective optimization that demonstrates strong performance across various benchmark settings.

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

*Zhen Liu,Yongtao Zhang,Shaobo Ren,Yuxin You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SATMC is a novel graph domain adaptation framework that addresses structural heterogeneity by sequentially aligning distributions via both graph structure and attribute transformations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in cross-network node classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph domain adaptation methods focus on transforming node attributes but struggle with structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, leading to suboptimal distribution alignment.

Method: SATMC uses sequential alignment via graph structure and attribute transformations, introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism, and employs empirical Wasserstein distance to enhance generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments on nine pairs of cross-domain datasets show SATMC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-network node classification, with theoretical proofs demonstrating tighter error bounds.

Conclusion: SATMC effectively addresses structural heterogeneity in graph domain adaptation and achieves superior performance in cross-network node classification tasks.

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The

*Wei Huang,De-Tian Chu,Lin-Yuan Bai,Wei Kang,Hai-Tao Zhang,Bo Li,Zhi-Mo Han,Jing Ge,Hai-Feng Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoMail is a self-evolving cognitive agent framework that uses a unified heterogeneous email graph and adversarial self-evolution to detect modern spam and phishing attacks more effectively than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spam detection systems struggle with modern multi-modal attacks that combine text, URLs, headers, and attachments, and cannot adapt quickly to evolving adversary strategies.

Method: Constructs unified heterogeneous email graphs fusing text, metadata, and embedded resources. Uses Cognitive Graph Neural Network enhanced by LLM for context-aware reasoning. Implements adversarial self-evolution loop with red-team agent generating evasion tactics and blue-team detector learning from failures.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam, SpamAssassin, TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants in detection accuracy, adaptability, and interpretability.

Conclusion: EvoMail demonstrates potential as a resilient and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing threats.

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

*Killian Steunou,Sigurd Saue,Théo Druilhe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a defense against adversarial attacks, comparing PCA and sparse PCA (SPCA) for image classification robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, and the authors explore simple, data-adapted defenses using dimensionality reduction techniques.

Method: Empirical comparison of PCA and SPCA as front-end feature extractors, complemented by theoretical analysis including robustness certificates for linear heads and Lipschitz composition arguments for non-linear heads.

Result: SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Conclusion: Sparsity in projections reduces adversarial leverage, and this benefit persists beyond linear settings, making SPCA an effective defense mechanism.

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAD-Tokenizer is a multimodal tokenization framework that represents CAD sequences with primitive-level tokens, enabling better text-guided CAD prototyping by capturing geometric structure and improving LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics and hindering geometric structure modeling. A multimodal tokenization strategy aligned with CAD's primitive and structural nature is needed for effective text-guided CAD prototyping.

Method: Proposed CAD-Tokenizer framework using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level pooling and constrained decoding to produce compact, primitive-aware representations that align with CAD's structural nature.

Result: CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction following and generation quality in unified text-guided CAD prototyping, achieving better quantitative and qualitative performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal tokenization strategy provides more effective representations for CAD data, enabling successful text-guided CAD prototyping by better capturing the primitive-level semantics and geometric structure of CAD sequences.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

*Giuseppe Serra,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DATS (Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling), a method for improving calibration in Continual Learning by adapting temperature parameters based on task distance without requiring task information at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CL approaches use a single temperature for calibration across all tasks, which overlooks task-specific differences and leads to inconsistent calibration errors. Safety-critical applications require reliable uncertainty communication through calibrated confidence scores.

Method: DATS combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without prior task information during deployment.

Result: Extensive evaluation on standard benchmarks and real-world biomedical datasets shows DATS is stable, reliable, and consistently reduces calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DATS provides a principled approach for task-adaptive calibration in continual learning, addressing the limitations of single-temperature methods and improving uncertainty estimation without requiring task labels at test time.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoT (Mixture of Thoughts) is a method for latent-level collaboration among heterogeneous LLMs using a global routing scheme, achieving state-of-the-art performance with single-pass inference and minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source LLMs increasingly specialize by domain, creating a need for systems that can leverage complementary strengths across different models. Prior approaches have limitations in routing, aggregation, or architectural requirements.

Method: A lightweight router selects top-K experts and designates a primary expert. Interaction layers project hidden states into a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over active peers. Only the router and interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training objective.

Result: MoT surpasses state-of-the-art Avengers by +0.38% on in-distribution benchmarks and +2.92% on out-of-distribution benchmarks, while significantly outperforming the best single model with runtime comparable to routing baselines.

Conclusion: MoT offers a simple latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, representing a practical step toward broader multi-LLM collaboration with single-pass inference and minimal overhead.

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

*Nicola Novello,Federico Fontana,Luigi Cinque,Deniz Gunduz,Andrea M. Tonello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified f-divergence framework for machine unlearning in diffusion models, showing that existing MSE-based methods are a special case and analyzing the benefits of different divergences for balancing unlearning effectiveness and concept preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for text-to-image models rely on minimizing MSE between output distributions, but this approach may not be optimal for all applications. The authors aim to provide a more flexible framework that can better balance aggressive unlearning with concept preservation.

Method: The authors develop a unified f-divergence-based framework where any f-divergence can be used for unlearning, rather than just MSE. They analyze how different divergences affect convergence properties and unlearning quality.

Result: The paper demonstrates that MSE-based unlearning is a special case of their unified framework. Different f-divergences offer varying trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation, allowing selection of optimal divergence for specific applications.

Conclusion: The proposed f-divergence framework provides a flexible paradigm for machine unlearning in diffusion models, enabling better customization of unlearning strategies based on application requirements and offering improved control over the unlearning-preservation trade-off.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus,Aurélien Bibaut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a simplified approach to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) by reducing it to two supervised learning problems: probabilistic classification to estimate behavior policy and iterative regression to solve a linear fixed-point equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IRL methods involve complex inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or adversarial training, which complicate the use of modern function approximators like neural networks.

Method: The authors show that softmax IRL can be characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy, reducing the problem to two straightforward supervised learning tasks.

Result: The proposed method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to MaxEnt IRL while being simpler and more modular across different function approximation classes.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical, scalable alternative to traditional IRL methods that can better leverage modern function approximators.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

### [141] [Closed-form $\ell_r$ norm scaling with data for overparameterized linear regression and diagonal linear networks under $\ell_p$ bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21181)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a unified characterization of parameter norm scaling for overparameterized linear regression with minimum-ℓp interpolators, revealing a competition between signal spikes and null coordinates that explains norm saturation behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different ℓr norms scale with sample size in overparameterized linear regression, particularly for minimum-ℓp interpolators where p∈(1,2], which has been an unresolved question despite its importance for generalization proxies.

Method: The authors use a dual-ray analysis approach that examines the competition between signal spikes and null coordinates in X⊤Y, leading to closed-form predictions for data-dependent transitions and universal thresholds.

Result: The analysis reveals: (i) a data-dependent transition point n⋆ (the 'elbow'), and (ii) a universal threshold r⋆=2(p-1) that separates ℓr norms that plateau from those that continue growing. The method successfully explains scaling behavior for all ℓr norms within r∈[1,p].

Conclusion: The unified solution provides insights into norm saturation behavior and extends to diagonal linear networks, showing they inherit similar elbow/threshold laws. This suggests generalization proxies' predictive power depends sensitively on which ℓr norm is used.

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

### [142] [Differential-Integral Neural Operator for Long-Term Turbulence Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21196)
*Hao Wu,Yuan Gao,Fan Xu,Fan Zhang,Qingsong Wen,Kun Wang,Xiaomeng Huang,Xian Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel neural operator framework called DINO that decomposes turbulent flow modeling into local differential and global integral operators to enable stable long-term forecasting of turbulence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods fail in long-term turbulence forecasting due to error accumulation and inability to capture both local dissipative effects and global non-local interactions simultaneously.

Method: Proposes DINO with parallel branches: a constrained convolutional network for local differential operator modeling derivatives, and a Transformer architecture for global integral operator learning data-driven kernels.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on 2D Kolmogorov flow benchmark, suppressing error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps while maintaining vorticity field and energy spectrum fidelity.

Conclusion: DINO establishes a new benchmark for physically consistent long-range turbulence forecasting through its physics-based operator decomposition approach.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This review paper examines physics-informed machine learning approaches for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), focusing on how physical knowledge can be embedded into data-driven models to address challenges like noisy data, limited labels, and complex system behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world PHM faces persistent challenges including noisy/incomplete sensor data, limited labels, and complex nonlinear degradation behaviors. Physics-informed ML offers a promising approach to overcome these limitations by incorporating physical knowledge into data-driven models.

Method: The review examines two main approaches: learning biases (embedding physical constraints through physics-informed loss functions, governing equations, and properties like monotonicity) and observational biases (influencing data selection/synthesis through virtual sensing, physics-based simulation, and multi-sensor fusion). Also covers reinforcement learning for active decision-making and scaling methods like meta-learning.

Result: The paper demonstrates how physics-informed approaches enable transition from passive prediction to active decision-making through reinforcement learning, closing the loop between model predictions, simulation, and actual system operation for adaptive decision-making.

Conclusion: Physics-informed ML provides effective strategies for PHM by ensuring physically consistent predictions, enabling active maintenance optimization, and supporting scalable deployment from individual assets to fleet-wide applications through fast adaptation methods.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

*Nikolay Blagoev,Bart Cox,Jérémie Decouchant,Lydia Y. Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GWTF is the first crash-tolerant decentralized training framework for LLMs that enables efficient collaborative training on heterogeneous volunteer clients while handling node churn and network instabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize LLM training by enabling collaborative training on volunteer heterogeneous clients, addressing the limitations of existing distributed and federated frameworks that don't handle node churn and network instabilities effectively.

Method: Uses a novel decentralized flow algorithm that finds optimal routing to maximize the number of microbatches trained with minimal delay, specifically designed for heterogeneous clients with varying resources and connectivity.

Result: GWTF reduces training time by up to 45% in realistic scenarios involving heterogeneous client nodes distributed across 10 geographic locations with high node churn rates.

Conclusion: GWTF represents a significant advancement in decentralized LLM training, providing practical crash tolerance and efficient resource utilization for democratizing large language model training.

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

*Zifan Wang,Anqi Dong,Mahmoud Selim,Michael M. Zavlanos,Karl H. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated Flow Matching (FFM) enables training flow matching models on decentralized data without central aggregation, addressing privacy constraints through three approaches: FFM-vanilla, FFM-LOT, and FFM-GOT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data is decentralized across devices and institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization, creating a need to train generative models directly from distributed data locally.

Method: Three federated strategies: FFM-vanilla (local training with independent couplings), FFM-LOT (local optimal transport couplings), and FFM-GOT (global optimal transport with shared potential function for cross-client coordination).

Result: Experiments show FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing flow straightness and sample quality, with performance comparable to centralized baselines on synthetic and image datasets.

Conclusion: FFM provides an effective framework for privacy-preserving generative model training in federated settings, with FFM-GOT achieving the best performance through global coordination while maintaining privacy.

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

*Xinyu Lian,Masahiro Tanaka,Olatunji Ruwase,Minjia Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SuperOffload is a novel offloading system designed for Superchips (tightly coupled GPU-CPU architectures) that achieves up to 2.5x throughput improvement for LLM training, enabling training of 25B models on a single chip and scaling to 13B models with 1M token sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There has been limited research on how LLM training benefits from Superchips' tightly coupled heterogeneous architecture, which differs significantly from traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU systems and requires revisiting offloading assumptions.

Method: SuperOffload uses adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware casting, speculative execution, and optimized Adam optimizer for Grace CPUs. It also integrates ZeRO-style data parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism.

Result: Evaluation on NVIDIA GH200 shows 2.5x throughput improvement over state-of-the-art offloading systems, enabling 25B model training on a single Superchip and 13B model training with 1M token sequences on 8 GH200 chips achieving 55% MFU.

Conclusion: SuperOffload demonstrates that Superchips' tightly coupled architecture enables more efficient LLM training through specialized offloading techniques, significantly advancing the capabilities of single-chip and multi-chip training systems.

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

### [148] [Optimal Robust Recourse with $L^p$-Bounded Model Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21293)
*Phone Kyaw,Kshitij Kayastha,Shahin Jabbari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new algorithm for computing optimal robust recourse under L^p norm constraints, addressing limitations of prior L^∞ approaches by achieving significantly lower recourse costs and better validity-cost trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robust recourse methods using L^∞ norm constraints lead to high-cost solutions. The authors aim to develop a more practical approach using L^p norms (p≥1, p≠∞) to provide cost-effective recourses that remain valid under model updates.

Method: The authors propose a new provably optimal algorithm for computing robust recourse for generalized linear models under L^p norm constraints. The approach handles more constrained model changes than L^∞ norm methods.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the algorithm achieves up to several orders of magnitude lower recourse costs compared to prior work, provides better trade-offs between implementation cost and validity, and generates more sparse recourses while remaining resilient to post-processing.

Conclusion: The proposed L^p norm-based robust recourse algorithm significantly outperforms existing L^∞ approaches by providing more cost-effective, sparse, and resilient recourse recommendations for algorithmic decision-making systems.

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

*Kevin Bradley Dsouza,Graham Alexander Watt,Yuri Leonenko,Juan Moreno-Cruz*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ECHO-MIMIC is a computational framework that transforms ill-structured collective action problems into well-structured problems by discovering executable heuristics and persuasive rationales through evolutionary search driven by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collective action problems are challenging because individual agents cannot easily see the connection between their local actions and global outcomes, with conflicting stakeholder objectives and no clear algorithm to bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare.

Method: The framework operates in two stages: ECHO evolves Python code snippets for behavioral policies, while MIMIC evolves natural language messages to motivate adoption. Both use LLM-driven evolutionary search where the LLM proposes variants and selection retains those maximizing collective performance in simulation.

Result: Applied to agricultural landscape management, ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals.

Conclusion: ECHO-MIMIC transforms the cognitive burden of collective action into simple agent-level instructions, making ill-structured problems solvable and opening new paths for scalable, adaptive policy design.

Abstract: Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with
collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For
an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes
are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear
algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present
ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into
a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering
compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework
operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from
Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral
policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference & Messaging for
Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages
that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a
large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and
context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains
those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We
demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape
management, where local farming decisions impact global ecological
connectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics
compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align
simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling
algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms
the cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level
instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice
and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.

TL;DR: RadAgents is a multi-agent framework for chest X-ray interpretation that addresses limitations in clinical interpretability, multimodal fusion, and inconsistency resolution through task-aware reasoning and verification mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic systems for CXR interpretation lack clinically interpretable reasoning aligned with guidelines, insufficiently fuse multimodal evidence, and fail to detect/resolve cross-tool inconsistencies without principled verification mechanisms.

Method: A multi-agent framework that couples clinical priors with task-aware multimodal reasoning, integrating grounding and multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts.

Result: The system produces outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with clinical practice compared to prevailing methods.

Conclusion: RadAgents bridges critical gaps in CXR interpretation by providing clinically aligned, visually grounded reasoning with built-in verification mechanisms for improved reliability and transparency.

Abstract: Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks
through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and
external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation,
prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither
clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere
aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused,
yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems
rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled
verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a
multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with
task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and
multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts,
resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with
clinical practice.
