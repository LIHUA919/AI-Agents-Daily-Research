Yet a collection of safe agents does not guarantee a safe\ncollection of agents, as interactions between agents over time create emergent\nbehaviours and induce novel failure modes. This means multi-agent systems\nrequire a fundamentally different risk analysis approach than that used for a\nsingle agent.\n  This report addresses the early stages of risk identification and analysis\nfor multi-agent AI systems operating within governed environments where\norganisations control their agent configurations and deployment. In this\nsetting, we examine six critical failure modes: cascading reliability failures,\ninter-agent communication failures, monoculture collapse, conformity bias,\ndeficient theory of mind, and mixed motive dynamics. For each, we provide a\ntoolkit for practitioners to extend or integrate into their existing frameworks\nto assess these failure modes within their organisational contexts.\n  Given fundamental limitations in current LLM behavioural understanding, our\napproach centres on analysis validity, and advocates for progressively\nincreasing validity through staged testing across stages of abstraction and\ndeployment that gradually increases exposure to potential negative impacts,\nwhile collecting convergent evidence through simulation, observational\nanalysis, benchmarking, and red teaming. This methodology establishes the\ngroundwork for robust organisational risk management as these LLM-based\nmulti-agent systems are deployed and operated."}

Traditional rule-based systems and\nnumerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and\nadaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces\nGrid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language\nModels (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate\ngrid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with\nnumerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent\ngenerates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers,\nwhile a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness\nvia sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability,\nGrid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that\ndynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and\ncomplexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through\noptimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment\nstrategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE\n69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation\nperformance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and\nlearning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse\nnetwork topologies.

The latter includes terms based on the first and second order\nderivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the\nregularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on\nStatistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be\napplied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time\nseries.

However, excessively long reasoning traces introduce substantial\nchallenges in terms of training cost, inference latency, and deployment\nfeasibility. While various CoT compression approaches have emerged to address\nthis challenge, they face inherent trade-offs: token-level methods often\ndisrupt syntactic and logical coherence, while step-level methods based on\nperplexity fail to reliably capture the logically critical reasoning steps. In\nthis paper, we propose ASAP (Anchor-guided, Surprisal-based Pruning), a novel\ncoarse-to-fine framework for CoT compression. ASAP first performs anchor-guided\npruning to preserve the core reasoning structure, which efficiently reduces the\nsearch space for subsequent processing. It then enables a logic-aware pruning\nby selecting logically essential reasoning steps based on a novel first-token\nsurprisal metric. Finally, ASAP teaches models to autonomously generate and\nleverage these concise CoTs at inference time, enabling efficient reasoning in\ncoding tasks. Experiments show that ASAP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy\nacross multiple code generation benchmarks while substantially reducing\ntraining and inference costs.

In this work, we first identify two main challenges in\nmodeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and\nmeta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of\nsemantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive\nHeterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN\nemploys a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily\ndistributions specific to both hops and meta-paths.

The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately\nfabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a\nsignificant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such\ndeception by explicitly setting a \"hidden\" objective through prompting or\nfine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.\nMoving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated\ndeception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this\nevaluation, we propose a novel framework using \"contact searching questions.\"\nThis framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological\nprinciples to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive\nIntention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The\nsecond, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's\ninternal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we\nfind that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in\nparallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a\nmathematical model to explain this behavior.
