Motivation: Assisting system designers in optimizing structures for complex enterprise architectures through intelligent load distribution.

Method: Utilizes social behavior and adaptation abilities of agents with self-assessment capabilities to determine optimal configurations.

Result: The proposed agent system has been successfully implemented with experimental results demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The multi-resource load balancing strategy proves viable for enhancing enterprise architecture optimization through agent-based approaches.

Abstract: The paper presents a multi-resource load balancing strategy which can be utilised within an agent-based system. This approach can assist system designers in their attempts to optimise the structure for complex enterprise architectures. In this system, the social behaviour of the agent and its adaptation abilities are applied to determine an optimal setup for a given configuration. All the methods have been developed to allow the agent's self-assessment. The proposed agent system has been implemented and the experiment results are presented here.

*Rathin Chandra Shit,Sharmila Subudhi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: HACN is a three-tier hierarchical architecture for multi-agent systems that reduces communication complexity from O(n²) to O(n) while achieving 99.9% less communication overhead and ensuring consensus convergence through adaptive policies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing consensus strategies in multi-agent systems face challenges with adaptability, scalability, and convergence, leading to communication bottlenecks, rigid decision-making, and slow responses in complex tasks.

Method: Three-layer architecture: 1) Local agent clusters perform confidence-based voting, 2) Inter-cluster communication with partial knowledge sharing and dynamic timeouts, 3) Global orchestration with adaptable decision rules for final arbitration.

Result: Achieved O(n) communication complexity vs O(n²) in existing systems, 99.9% reduction in communication overhead during consensus convergence, and reliable consensus convergence across complex tasks.

Conclusion: HACN provides a scalable, adaptive consensus framework that significantly reduces communication overhead while ensuring reliable convergence in multi-agent systems through hierarchical coordination and dynamic policy adaptation.

Abstract: The consensus strategies used in collaborative multi-agent systems (MAS) face notable challenges related to adaptability, scalability, and convergence certainties. These approaches, including structured workflows, debate models, and iterative voting, often lead to communication bottlenecks, stringent decision-making processes, and delayed responses in solving complex and evolving tasks. This article introduces a three-tier architecture, the Hierarchical Adaptive Consensus Network (\hacn), which suggests various consensus policies based on task characterization and agent performance metrics. The first layer collects the confidence-based voting outcomes of several local agent clusters. In contrast, the second level facilitates inter-cluster communication through cross-clustered partial knowledge sharing and dynamic timeouts. The third layer provides system-wide coordination and final arbitration by employing a global orchestration framework with adaptable decision rules. The proposed model achieves $\bigO(n)$ communication complexity, as opposed to the $\bigO(n^2)$ complexity of the existing fully connected MAS. Experiments performed in a simulated environment yielded a 99.9\% reduction in communication overhead during consensus convergence. Furthermore, the proposed approach ensures consensus convergence through hierarchical escalation and dynamic adaptation for a wide variety of complicated tasks.
