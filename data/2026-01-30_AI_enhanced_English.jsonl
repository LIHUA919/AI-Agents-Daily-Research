Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales.

In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher.

The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3.
