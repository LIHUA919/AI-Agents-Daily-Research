While forecasting mental health scores alone offers\nlimited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,\nquasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity\nDesign (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are\nmore likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the\nsize of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for\nanxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond\ntraditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future\ndiscontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear\ntrajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic\ncovariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static\nrepresentations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the\nanxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult\nbut more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the\nbest results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our\napproach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$\nfor slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity\nforecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects\nof potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Adapting Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity Design (LRDD) into a statistical learning framework to forecast mental health discontinuities and slope changes from local events, showing significant improvement over traditional methods.", "motivation": "Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital for public health policy, but traditional forecasting alone offers limited insights into causal impacts of events on community well-being.", "method": "Proposed adapting LRDDs into a statistical learning framework that estimates future discontinuities and slope changes using location's score history, dynamic covariates, and exogenous variables.

We classify it in two key dimensions: source\nheterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and\nuser heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across\nindividuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific\ninformation, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their\nreal-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns\nlatent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream\npredictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.\nSpecifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source\nheterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user\nheterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term\nphysiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a\ndiscriminative representation space.
