Each week, the agent receives updated epidemiological information, evaluates the evolving situation, and sets business restriction levels. The agent is equipped with a dynamic memory that weights past events by recency and is evaluated in both single- and ensemble-agent settings across environments of varying complexity.

Current knowledge distillation in time series is predominantly based on logit and feature aligning techniques originally developed for computer vision tasks. These methods do not explicitly account for temporal data and fall short in two key aspects. First, the mechanisms by which the transferred knowledge helps the student model learning process remain unclear due to uninterpretability of logits and features. Second, these methods transfer only limited knowledge, primarily replicating the teacher predictive accuracy. As a result, student models often produce predictive distributions that differ significantly from those of their teachers, hindering their safe substitution for teacher models. In this work, we propose transferring interpretable knowledge by extending conventional logit transfer to convey not just the right prediction but also the right reasoning of the teacher. Specifically, we induce other useful knowledge from the teacher logits termed temporal saliency which captures the importance of each input timestep to the teacher prediction. By training the student with Temporal Saliency Distillation we encourage it to make predictions based on the same input features as the teacher. Temporal Saliency Distillation requires no additional parameters or architecture specific assumptions.

Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), thereby retaining high performance while reducing computational demands. Current KD methods, originally designed for computer vision tasks, neglect the unique temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics of time series models.

In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB.

This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints.

These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?\n  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems.

One promising approach is to extend the rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy. To enable this, it is required to detect the patient's intention to move to trigger the assistance of a robotic device. This intention to move can be detected from human surface electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, it is particularly challenging to decode when classifications are performed online and asynchronously. In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows.

Interestingly, we found no significant improvements between performances of the best single model and classifier ensembles in the offline evaluation.

These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback.

Modeling false positives and false negatives and grouping completions into recurring reasoning modes yields a replicator-style (natural-selection) flow on the probability simplex.

While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour.

Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets.

Yet despite their (we would argue) inevitability, the research community has yet to specify exactly how these algorithms for computational AIR compliance should behave - or how we should benchmark their performance. To fill these gaps, we specify a set of design goals for such algorithms.
