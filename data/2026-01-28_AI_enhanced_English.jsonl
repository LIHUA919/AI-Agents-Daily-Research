In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior.

Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster.

However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task. Finally, losses are calculated within these perception spaces to optimize the model.

A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification", "comment": "17 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "A CNN combined with a single BiLSTM layer performs best for multi-label ECG classification, balancing performance and complexity; deeper recurrent models add minimal benefit and can overfit.", "motivation": "Accurate multi-label ECG classification is hard due to multiple coexisting conditions, class imbalance, and long-range dependencies in multi-lead recordings, and the necessity of complex deep recurrent architectures hasn't been rigorously studied.", "method": "Systematic comparison of CNN with various recurrent configurations (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, stacked variants) on PTB-XL dataset with 23 diagnostic categories, using CNN as baseline for morphology and integrating recurrent layers for temporal modeling.", "result": "CNN with single BiLSTM layer achieves best trade-off with lowest Hamming loss (0.0338), highest macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723); stacked recurrences sometimes improve recall for rare classes but often reduce precision and generalizability.", "conclusion": "Architectural alignment with ECG's temporal structure matters more than increased recurrent depth for robust performance and clinical deployment; deeper models show diminishing returns and overfitting risks."}}
