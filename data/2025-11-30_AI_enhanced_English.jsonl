While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair.\n  A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies.\n  By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) to quantify cognitive recovery latency in multi-agent systems, showing automated reflexes restore stability faster than human interventions.", "motivation": "Existing observability tools monitor system outputs but cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence is lost in autonomous multi-agent systems.", "method": "Adapted classical reliability metrics (MTTR, MTBF) to cognitive domain, conducted benchmark simulation using AG News corpus and LangGraph framework, modeling recovery latencies across reflex modes.", "result": "Automated reflexes restored stability in ~6s vs ~12s for human interventions; median MTTR-A was 6.21\u00b12.14s, MTBF=6.7\u00b12.14s, NRR=0.08 across 200 runs.", "conclusion": "Formalizes recovery latency as quantifiable property of distributed reasoning, establishing foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition and transforming cognitive recovery into standardized performance metric."}}
