### [1] [Signal Use and Emergent Cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18920)
*Michael Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autonomous agents in tribes use neural networks (NEC-DAC) to develop shared culture via communication, improving coordination and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how autonomous agents self-organize into cultures through communication and how this impacts their collective performance.

Method: Employed the NEC-DAC system with neural networks for agent decision-making, analyzing social structures like authority hierarchies.

Result: Culture of cooperation enhances tribe performance; signals enable culture emergence and transmission across generations.

Conclusion: Communication and coordination strategies are key to developing agent cultures, significantly improving collective efficiency.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes,
learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance
their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture -
Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with
its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents
develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and
signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within
these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their
fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as
authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly
influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not
only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission
across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of
coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

### [2] [Do LLMs Know When to Flip a Coin? Strategic Randomization through Reasoning and Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18928)
*Lingyu Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores strategic randomization in LLMs using a zero-sum game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, evaluating five LLMs' ability to randomize decisions under different prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strategic randomization is underexplored in LLMs, and prior work conflates cognitive randomization with mechanical randomness, leading to incomplete evaluations.

Method: A novel zero-sum game with Nash equilibrium as maximal entropy strategy is used. Five LLMs are evaluated across framed, neutral, and hinted prompts in competitive gameplay.

Result: Weaker models remain deterministic, while stronger models randomize more under hints. Strong LLMs exploit weaker models deterministically but converge to equilibrium with peers.

Conclusion: The study reveals variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning, highlighting opportunities for improving abstract reasoning and adaptive learning.

Abstract: Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains
underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the
cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,
leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum
game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds
to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from
untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt
styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament
gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to
randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of
prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit
hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to
exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through
win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful
variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities
for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our
implementation publicly available at
https://github.com/ocelopus/llm-when-to-throw-coin to ensure full
reproducibility.

### [3] [A Comment On "The Illusion of Thinking": Reframing the Reasoning Cliff as an Agentic Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18957)
*Sheraz Khan,Subha Madhavan,Kannan Natarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques Shojaee et al.'s (2025) claim of a reasoning cliff in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), arguing it's due to experimental constraints, not fundamental limits. It shows tool-enabled models can surpass these limits, suggesting the issue is execution, not reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the idea that LRMs have intrinsic reasoning limits by highlighting flaws in the evaluation paradigm and demonstrating improved performance with agentic tools.

Method: Empirically refutes the reasoning cliff claim by enabling models with tools, solving problems previously deemed impossible, and analyzing tool-enabled reasoning hierarchies.

Result: Tool-enabled models solve problems beyond the reasoning cliff, showing performance collapse is due to interface restrictions, not reasoning failure.

Conclusion: The illusion of reasoning limits in LRMs stems from restrictive evaluation setups; agentic tools reveal their true potential, redefining machine intelligence metrics.

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:
Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of
Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,
where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a
specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling
limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while
acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion
is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is
not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable
outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation
paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the
absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and
output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens
of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but
at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically
substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,
initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,
now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of
complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.
Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and
GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural
execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant
implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion
of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a
consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

### [4] [From Rows to Yields: How Foundation Models for Tabular Data Simplify Crop Yield Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19046)
*Filip Sabo,Michele Meroni,Maria Piles,Martin Claverie,Fanie Ferreira,Elna Van Den Berg,Francesco Collivignarelli,Felix Rembold*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TabPFN, a foundation model for tabular data, was applied to sub-national yield forecasting in South Africa using EO and weather data. It matched ML models in accuracy but offered faster tuning and simpler implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate TabPFN's performance in real-world yield forecasting, comparing it with traditional ML models and baselines.

Method: Used dekadal EO and weather data, aggregated monthly, to forecast crop yields. Benchmarked TabPFN against six ML and three baseline models using leave-one-year-out cross-validation.

Result: TabPFN and ML models had comparable accuracy, both outperforming baselines. TabPFN excelled in tuning speed and reduced feature engineering needs.

Conclusion: TabPFN is a practical choice for yield forecasting due to its efficiency and ease of use, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: We present an application of a foundation model for small- to medium-sized
tabular data (TabPFN), to sub-national yield forecasting task in South Africa.
TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional
machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We
used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil
moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and
radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The
crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate
variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and
aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against
six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation
experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models
capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models
exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN
demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning
time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a
more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications,
where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.

### [5] [Baba is LLM: Reasoning in a Game with Dynamic Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19095)
*Fien van Wetten,Aske Plaat,Max van Duijn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' performance in the puzzle game Baba is You, revealing challenges in reasoning about dynamic rule changes despite finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to handle tasks requiring both language skills and reasoning, using the game Baba is You as a test case.

Method: Six LLMs were tested with three prompt types; two models were finetuned with game data. Performance was measured in puzzle-solving and rule application.

Result: Larger models (e.g., GPT-4o) performed better, but smaller models struggled. Finetuning improved level analysis but not solution formulation.

Conclusion: LLMs, even state-of-the-art ones, struggle with dynamic rule reasoning, highlighting the challenge of tasks requiring deep reflection and problem-solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform well on language tasks, but
struggle with reasoning tasks. This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play
the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by
rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this
rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a
compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt
types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts.
In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and
structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models
(particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller
unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes.
Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not
significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for
state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is
difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The
results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex
problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically
changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.

### [6] [Spiritual-LLM : Gita Inspired Mental Health Therapy In the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19185)
*Janak Kapuriya,Aman Singh,Jainendra Shukla,Rajiv Ratn Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GITes, a framework combining spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad Gita with GPT-4o to improve emotional support, showing significant improvements in NLP and spiritual metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mental health support lacks depth; integrating spiritual wisdom aims to address deeper emotional needs.

Method: Developed GITes dataset with spiritually guided responses, benchmarked against 12 LLMs, and introduced a Spiritual Insight metric for evaluation.

Result: Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct showed improvements: 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, and 15.92% in Spiritual Insight.

Conclusion: AI systems with spiritual guidance enhance user satisfaction, but real-world validation is needed.

Abstract: Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based
solely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial
interventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study
introduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad
Gita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.
We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,
which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729
spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain
experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both
mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual
relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics
capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment
via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating
spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual
metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving
improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,
15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance
compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial
improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further
validation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our
findings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual
guidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes. The code
and dataset will be publicly available to advance further research in this
emerging area.

### [7] [Bayesian Evolutionary Swarm Architecture: A Formal Epistemic System Grounded in Truth-Based Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19191)
*Craig Steven Wright*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for AI systems with probabilistic agents using Bayesian inference, competition, and belief revision to evolve toward truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a mathematically rigorous AI system where truth emerges from structured competition and belief updates among agents.

Method: Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, updating beliefs via Bayesian inference and pairwise utility comparisons. Cryptographic identities and causal inference ensure traceability and robustness.

Result: The system converges to truth as an evolutionary attractor, with formal guarantees on convergence, robustness, and stability.

Conclusion: Truth emerges from adversarial epistemic pressure in a self-regulating swarm, providing a computable model for verifiable knowledge.

Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial
intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through
structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in
Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent
fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing
ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting
posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents
reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated
via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve
measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based
cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal
inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence,
robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes
truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge
arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating
swarm.

### [8] [GBGC: Efficient and Adaptive Graph Coarsening via Granular-ball Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19224)
*Shuyin Xia,Guan Wang,Gaojie Xu,Sen Zhao,Guoyin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new graph coarsening method, GBGC, leverages multi-granularity and granular-ball computing to improve efficiency and accuracy, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph coarsening methods focus on spectrum-preserving but ignore multi-granularity structures, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: GBGC uses granular-ball computing to adaptively split the graph into optimal granularity levels, constructing coarsened graphs with supernodes.

Result: GBGC is faster (10-100x speedup) and more accurate than state-of-the-art methods, with lower time complexity.

Conclusion: GBGC's robustness and efficiency make it a promising standard for graph data preprocessing.

Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable
graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work
were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some
predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of
the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,
they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of
subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and
similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the
coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the
graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To
this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in
multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive
coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the
coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive
granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original
graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal
granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as
supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening
methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to
hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost
always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and
generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to
become a standard graph data preprocessing method.

### [9] [KnowRL: Exploring Knowledgeable Reinforcement Learning for Factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19807)
*Baochang Ren,Shuofei Qiao,Wenhao Yu,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowRL integrates knowledge verification into RL to reduce hallucinations in slow-thinking LLMs by rewarding fact-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high hallucination in slow-thinking LLMs due to lack of factual supervision in RL.

Method: Propose Knowledge-enhanced RL (KnowRL) with a factuality reward based on knowledge verification.

Result: KnowRL reduces hallucinations while preserving reasoning capabilities, validated on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models by enhancing fact-based reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code
is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

### [10] [RecLLM-R1: A Two-Stage Training Paradigm with Reinforcement Learning and Chain-of-Thought v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19235)
*Yu Xie,Xingkai Ren,Ying Qi,Yao Hu,Lianlei Shan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecLLM-R1 is a recommendation framework using LLMs to address filter bubbles and optimize business policies. It employs a two-stage training process (SFT and GRPO with CoT) and outperforms baselines in accuracy, diversity, and novelty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome filter bubbles, underutilization of external knowledge, and misalignment between model optimization and business policy iteration in traditional recommendation systems.

Method: Transforms data into LLM-interpretable prompts, uses SFT for foundational training, and GRPO with CoT for multi-step reasoning and reward-based optimization.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, diversity, and novelty on real-world social media data, reducing filter bubbles.

Conclusion: RecLLM-R1 effectively integrates recommendation optimization with business goals, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with "filter bubbles",
underutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model
optimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this
paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1
methodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical
interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural
language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process.
Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage
involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental
recommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through
multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward
function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity,
and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world
user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that
RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum
of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. It
effectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue
for the integrated optimization of recommendation models and policies under
intricate business goals.

### [11] [Emotion Detection on User Front-Facing App Interfaces for Enhanced Schedule Optimization: A Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19280)
*Feiting Yang,Antoine Moevus,Steve Lévesque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating emotion detection into calendar apps using biometric (HR/ECG) and behavioral (computer activity) methods, finding the latter more consistent and accurate, especially for mouse interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance productivity and engagement in HCI by dynamically adapting interfaces to users' emotional states.

Method: Two approaches: biometric (HR/ECG data processed via LSTM/GRU networks) and behavioral (machine learning on user interactions like mouse movements).

Result: Behavioral method outperformed, with 90% accuracy for mouse interactions; GRU networks achieved 84.38% accuracy for Valence prediction.

Conclusion: Behavioral emotion detection is more effective for adaptive interfaces, though biometric methods also show promise.

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved significantly to incorporate
emotion recognition capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for
adaptive and personalized user experiences. This paper explores the integration
of emotion detection into calendar applications, enabling user interfaces to
dynamically respond to users' emotional states and stress levels, thereby
enhancing both productivity and engagement. We present and evaluate two
complementary approaches to emotion detection: a biometric-based method
utilizing heart rate (HR) data extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
processed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
neural networks to predict the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance; and a behavioral method analyzing computer activity through multiple
machine learning models to classify emotions based on fine-grained user
interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke patterns. Our
comparative analysis, from real-world datasets, reveals that while both
approaches demonstrate effectiveness, the computer activity-based method
delivers superior consistency and accuracy, particularly for mouse-related
interactions, which achieved approximately 90\% accuracy. Furthermore, GRU
networks outperformed LSTM models in the biometric approach, with Valence
prediction reaching 84.38\% accuracy.

### [12] [Skywork-SWE: Unveiling Data Scaling Laws for Software Engineering in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19290)
*Liang Zeng,Yongcong Li,Yuzhen Xiao,Changshi Li,Chris Yuhao Liu,Rui Yan,Tianwen Wei,Jujie He,Xuchen Song,Yang Liu,Yahui Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated data-curation pipeline for software engineering (SWE) datasets, scaling volume and diversity. It presents the Skywork-SWE model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on SWE tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual data curation in SWE is time-consuming and limits dataset size. The authors aim to automate this process to enhance dataset scale and diversity.

Method: Proposes an incremental, automated pipeline for curating SWE datasets, including runtime-environment images for validation. Fine-tunes the Skywork-SWE model on this data.

Result: Skywork-SWE achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on SWE-bench, improving to 47.0% with test-time scaling, setting a new SOTA for sub-32B models.

Conclusion: Automated data curation and the Skywork-SWE model advance SWE capabilities in LLMs, with performance scaling with data size.

Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for
next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical
dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds)
and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data
curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily
relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated
runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most
existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.
To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that
systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our
dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct
GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language
and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.
We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training
trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE
model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the
trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs
continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of
saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based
LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the
incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves
to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter
models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future
research.

### [13] [FEAT: A Preference Feedback Dataset through a Cost-Effective Auto-Generation and Labeling Framework for English AI Tutoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19325)
*Hyein Seo,Taewook Hwang,Yohan Lee,sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FEAT is a cost-effective framework for generating teacher feedback in English education, using three datasets (DM, DG, DA) to balance quality and cost. Results show DA (DG + 5-10% DM) outperforms pure DM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI tutoring systems need high-quality teacher feedback data, but manual generation is costly. FEAT aims to provide a scalable, cost-efficient solution.

Method: Proposes FEAT with three datasets: DM (human-LLM collaboration), DG (LLM-only), and DA (DG augmented with DM). Tests performance of DA vs. DM.

Result: DA (DG + 5-10% DM) achieves better performance than 100% DM, balancing quality and cost.

Conclusion: FEAT offers a practical, scalable approach for generating teacher feedback, with DA as the optimal solution.

Abstract: In English education tutoring, teacher feedback is essential for guiding
students. Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers;
however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback
data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this
study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher
feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual
(DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively
generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)
DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower
quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small
portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)
into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.

*Debosmita Bhaumik,Julian Togelius,Georgios N. Yannakakis,Ahmed Khalifa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid method combining PCGML for game level generation and search-based algorithms for repair addresses non-functional levels with minimal changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fix non-functional game levels (e.g., incomplete or unreachable) while preserving stylistic integrity, especially in PCGML-generated levels.

Method: Uses evolutionary and quality-diversity search-based algorithms to repair levels with constraints on the number of changes.

Result: Effective repair of broken levels, demonstrating promise for hybrid PCG methods.

Conclusion: Combining PCGML with search-based repair offers a robust solution for functional and stylistically consistent game levels.

Abstract: We address the problem of game level repair, which consists of taking a
designed but non-functional game level and making it functional. This might
consist of ensuring the completeness of the level, reachability of objects, or
other performance characteristics. The repair problem may also be constrained
in that it can only make a small number of changes to the level. We investigate
search-based solutions to the level repair problem, particularly using
evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, with good results. This level
repair method is applied to levels generated using a machine learning-based
procedural content generation (PCGML) method that generates stylistically
appropriate but frequently broken levels. This combination of PCGML for
generation and search-based methods for repair shows great promise as a hybrid
procedural content generation (PCG) method.

TL;DR: CID-GraphRAG improves multi-turn customer service dialogues by combining intent-based graph traversal with semantic search, outperforming traditional RAG systems in coherence and goal progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing dialogue systems in maintaining contextual coherence and goal-oriented progression in multi-turn conversations.

Method: Constructs dynamic intent transition graphs and uses a dual-retrieval mechanism balancing intent-based traversal and semantic search.

Result: Outperforms baselines with 11% BLEU, 5% ROUGE-L, 6% METEOR gains, and 58% better response quality in LLM-as-judge evaluations.

Conclusion: CID-GraphRAG effectively integrates intent and semantic retrieval, enhancing dialogue coherence and goal progression.

Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of
existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and
goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike
traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation
RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic
intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements
a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph
traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to
simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual
semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In
extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both
automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG
significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based
GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG
demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic
metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and
most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge
evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent
transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that
neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an
effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual
coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn
dialogues.

### [16] [Is an object-centric representation beneficial for robotic manipulation ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19408)
*Alexandre Chapin,Emmanuel Dellandrea,Liming Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Object-centric representation (OCR) is evaluated in robotic manipulation tasks, showing better generalization than holistic methods in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess OCR's potential beyond scene decomposition, focusing on reasoning in multi-object robotic tasks.

Method: Created simulated robotic tasks with randomization and compared OCR against holistic representations.

Result: OCR outperforms holistic methods in complex scenarios with inter-object interactions.

Conclusion: OCR is promising for robotic tasks but needs improvement for difficult scene structures.

Abstract: Object-centric representation (OCR) has recently become a subject of interest
in the computer vision community for learning a structured representation of
images and videos. It has been several times presented as a potential way to
improve data-efficiency and generalization capabilities to learn an agent on
downstream tasks. However, most existing work only evaluates such models on
scene decomposition, without any notion of reasoning over the learned
representation. Robotic manipulation tasks generally involve multi-object
environments with potential inter-object interaction. We thus argue that they
are a very interesting playground to really evaluate the potential of existing
object-centric work. To do so, we create several robotic manipulation tasks in
simulated environments involving multiple objects (several distractors, the
robot, etc.) and a high-level of randomization (object positions, colors,
shapes, background, initial positions, etc.). We then evaluate one classical
object-centric method across several generalization scenarios and compare its
results against several state-of-the-art hollistic representations. Our results
exhibit that existing methods are prone to failure in difficult scenarios
involving complex scene structures, whereas object-centric methods help
overcome these challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with adaptability and domain shift in diverse datasets.

*Yazhou Zhang,Chunwang Zou,Bo Wang,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Commander-GPT, a modular framework using specialized LLM agents and centralized commanders, improves sarcasm understanding, outperforming SoTA baselines by 4.4% and 11.7% in F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with sarcasm understanding despite their success in other NLP tasks, prompting the need for a specialized framework.

Method: Commander-GPT employs a team of specialized LLM agents for sub-tasks (e.g., context modeling, sentiment analysis) and integrates their outputs via centralized commanders (lightweight encoders, small autoregressive models, or large LLMs).

Result: The framework achieves significant improvements (4.4% and 11.7% in F1 scores) over SoTA baselines on MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Commander-GPT effectively addresses sarcasm understanding by leveraging modular decision routing and specialized agents, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm understanding is a high-order cognitive task. Although
large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many
downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm
understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision
routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a
single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM
agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such
as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed
back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final
sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of
centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander
(e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models,
serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large
LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output
aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate
Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting
strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and
11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on
average, demonstrating its effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome traditional RAG's issues like retrieval drift, redundancy, and rigidity in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Uses RDRA, STIE, NLR mechanisms and hybrid training to improve reasoning.

framework addresses key limitations of traditional RAG, such as retrieval
drift, information redundancy, and strategy rigidity. Key innovations include

### [20] [NaviAgent: Bilevel Planning on Tool Dependency Graphs for Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19500)
*Yan Jiang,Hao Zhou,LiZhong GU,Ai Han,TianLong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NaviAgent introduces a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust function calling in LLMs, outperforming baselines in task success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and rigid tool invocation limits complex toolchain orchestration, necessitating a more robust and dynamic approach.

Method: NaviAgent uses a Multi-Path Decider for dynamic action selection and a Graph-Encoded Navigator with a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph (TDHG) and heuristic search.

Result: NaviAgent achieves higher task success rates (TSR) than baselines (e.g., 13.5% to 19.0% improvement) and maintains efficiency, with fine-tuned models surpassing larger ones.

Conclusion: NaviAgent's architecture, especially the Graph-Encoded Navigator, significantly enhances toolchain orchestration, proving essential for complex tasks and larger models.

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely
hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at
large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,
resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We
introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust
function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.
As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional
decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically
selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The
Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph
(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with
historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search
strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful
toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent
consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation
models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,
ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,
and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one
step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality
and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of
49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture.
Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of
2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models
(Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain
orchestration.

### [21] [NTRL: Encounter Generation via Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in Dungeons and Dragons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19530)
*Carlo Romeo,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NTRL uses reinforcement learning to automate D&D combat encounter design, improving difficulty and strategic depth while maintaining fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual balancing of D&D combat encounters is complex and disrupts narrative flow, prompting the need for automation.

Method: Frames encounter design as a contextual bandit problem, optimizing encounters based on real-time party attributes.

Result: Extends combat longevity (+200%), increases damage dealt (-16.67% post-combat HP), and enhances tactical play without excessive TPKs.

Conclusion: NTRL outperforms human DMs by dynamically adjusting difficulty and deepening combat strategy while preserving fairness.

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a complex task
that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy
composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the
narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via
Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic
Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&D via combat encounter design. By framing the
problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time
party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL
iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases
damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and
raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills
(TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in
tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win
rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon
Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic
depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall
game fairness.

*Sanne Wielinga,Jesse Heyninck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining ASP-derived rules from FOLD-R++ with black-box ML classifiers improves accuracy and interpretability in medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performing ML models lack interpretability, while symbolic methods like ASP may not match their predictive power, necessitating a hybrid solution.

Method: Integrates ASP-derived rules (FOLD-R++) with black-box ML classifiers to correct uncertain predictions and provide explanations.

Result: Significant gains in accuracy and F1 score on five medical datasets.

Conclusion: Combining symbolic reasoning with ML achieves interpretability without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in high-stakes domains
such as healthcare, where accurate predictions can greatly enhance
decision-making. However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks
and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In
parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the
possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the
predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that
integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML
classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide
human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal
statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This
study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with
conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: TAPAS is a multi-agent framework combining LLMs and symbolic planning for complex tasks without manual environment models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve complex tasks dynamically without requiring manually defined environment models.

Method: Uses specialized LLM-based agents for collaborative domain model generation and adaptation, with ReAct-style execution and natural language plan translation.

Result: Strong performance in benchmark planning domains and VirtualHome simulation.

Conclusion: TAPAS effectively integrates LLMs and planning for adaptable task-solving without manual redefinition.

Abstract: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a
multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined
environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that
collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal
specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this
tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from
upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints
without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent,
coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between
dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS
demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the
VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

### [24] [ChordPrompt: Orchestrating Cross-Modal Prompt Synergy for Multi-Domain Incremental Learning in CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19608)
*Zhiyuan Wang,Bokui Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChordPrompt, a framework for continual learning in vision-language models, addressing limitations in existing prompt learning methods by leveraging cross-modal interactions and domain-adaptive prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods struggle with multi-domain task incremental learning and neglect cross-modal information exchange, limiting the adaptability of vision-language models like CLIP.

Method: ChordPrompt uses cross-modal prompts (visual and textual) and domain-adaptive text prompts to enhance continual learning across multiple domains.

Result: ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance on multi-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed ChordPrompt framework effectively addresses the limitations of current methods, improving adaptability and performance in continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt
effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without
comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While
vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain
performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt
learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on
class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for
multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ
single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal
information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt
framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual
prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions
between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs
domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual
adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain
incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task
performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs), a closed-loop framework integrating cognitive and embodied AI to overcome limitations in scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems and automated labs lack flexibility and autonomy for adaptive hypothesis testing in the physical world.

Method: ISLs combine foundation models for reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for physical experimentation.

Result: The framework aims to enable iterative, autonomous experimentation and serendipitous discovery.

Conclusion: ISLs are essential for advancing AI-driven science and overcoming existing discovery barriers.

Abstract: Scientific discovery has long been constrained by human limitations in
expertise, physical capability, and sleep cycles. The recent rise of AI
scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and
operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems
are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack
the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical
world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation
models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning,
and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and
embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems
that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of
serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of
Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework
that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify
foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration,
and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such
systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific
discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven
science.

### [26] [Identifying Macro Causal Effects in C-DMGs over DMGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19650)
*Simon Ferreira,Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proves that the do-calculus is unconditionally sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs, unlike in the ADMG setting. It also extends graphical criteria for non-identifiability to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world systems often involve cyclic causal dynamics and high-dimensional settings, making fully specified ADMGs impractical. Partially specified causal representations (C-DMGs) and ioSCMs address these challenges.

Method: The study generalizes SCMs to ioSCMs, allowing cycles, and defines C-DMGs over DMGs. It then proves the soundness and completeness of the do-calculus for macro causal effects in this setting.

Result: The do-calculus is unconditionally sound and complete for C-DMGs over DMGs. Non-identifiability criteria from C-DMGs over ADMGs extend to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

Conclusion: The findings enhance causal inference in cyclic, high-dimensional systems by validating the do-calculus for C-DMGs over DMGs and extending non-identifiability criteria.

Abstract: The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects
in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models
(SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in
high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often
infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified
causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs
(C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet
practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include
cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete
for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the
assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world
systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To
account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been
introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce
another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).
Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level
representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,
we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally
sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.
Furthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of
macro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends
to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

### [27] [From memories to maps: Mechanisms of in context reinforcement learning in transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19686)
*Ching Fang,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how episodic memory-like mechanisms in transformers enable rapid adaptation in reinforcement learning, resembling natural cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans and animals adapt quickly to new environments, contrasting with standard reinforcement learning methods.

Method: Training a transformer on in-context reinforcement learning tasks inspired by rodent behavior and analyzing the emergent learning algorithms.

Result: The model uses memory tokens to cache computations, resembling hippocampal-entorhinal brain systems, and develops non-standard reinforcement learning strategies.

Conclusion: Memory serves as a computational resource for flexible behavior, offering insights into rapid adaptation in both artificial and natural systems.

Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new
environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by
standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value
updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to
retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.
Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of
their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value
architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a
transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning
tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms
that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is
supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where
representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.
We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the
model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.
Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching
intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then
accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a
computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to
support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the
model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system
in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural
cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the
rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural
settings.

*Zhuojun Xie,Adam Abdin,Yiping Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework for predictive maintenance (PdM) to address suboptimal decisions caused by prediction errors in traditional methods. It shows improved decision quality and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty in ML models limits industrial adoption of PdM. The paper aims to improve decision-making by aligning predictive models with maintenance outcomes.

Method: The IEO framework jointly tunes predictive models while optimizing maintenance decisions, using a stochastic perturbation gradient descent algorithm for small datasets.

Result: Empirical results show a 22% reduction in maintenance regret compared to traditional methods, with improved robustness under model misspecification.

Conclusion: The IEO framework enhances decision quality in PdM by mitigating prediction errors, supporting reliable maintenance planning in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive
maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich
operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification
continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM
framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under
economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key
questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better
maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on
downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the
traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic
prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To
address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that
jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance
outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision
consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic
perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure
datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that
the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.
This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in
data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance
objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification
and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when
the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.
These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain
operational environments.

Motivation: Address privacy concerns and improve accuracy in differential diagnosis using unstructured medical records.

Method: Fine-tunes LLaMA-v3 with low-rank adaptation on DDXPlus dataset for pathology prediction and differential diagnosis.

Result: Superior performance in accuracy and explainability compared to existing methods, validated by extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: The platform offers reliable, explainable, and privacy-preserving AI for clinical use, advancing medical document analysis.

Abstract: Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential
clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical
tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition
among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical
expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy
concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs
services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using
low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.
Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential
diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and
variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The
developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured
medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By
incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures
transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence.
Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current
state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility
in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable,
explainable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence solutions,
representing a significant advancement in intelligent medical document analysis

TL;DR: AutoExperiment is a benchmark evaluating AI agents' ability to implement and run ML experiments from research papers, scaling difficulty by masking code functions. Performance degrades as task complexity increases, highlighting challenges in code generation and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's no existing benchmark to assess AI agents' capability in implementing scientific ideas with varying code starting points, from reproduction to full replication.

Method: Agents are given a research paper, a masked codebase, and a command to run the experiment. They must generate missing code, execute it, and reproduce results, with difficulty scaling by the number of masked functions.

Result: Performance drops as task complexity increases. Interactive agents outperform fixed ones, and multi-trial success rates (Pass@5) surpass single-shot (Pass@1).

Conclusion: AutoExperiment addresses critical challenges in AI-driven scientific experimentation, serving as a benchmark for progress in autonomous code generation and execution.

Abstract: Recent progress in autonomous code generation has fueled excitement around AI
agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by running experiments.
However, there is currently no benchmark that evaluates whether such agents can
implement scientific ideas when given varied amounts of code as a starting
point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch
replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce
AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and
run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in
research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase
with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is
to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed
environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by
varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction
to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that
performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically
interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents
in fixed "agentless" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between
single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating
verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical
challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous
experiment execution, establishing AutoExperiment as a new benchmark for
evaluating progress in AI-driven scientific experimentation. Our data and code

### [31] [Automatic Prompt Optimization for Knowledge Graph Construction: Insights from an Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19773)
*Nandana Mihindukulasooriya,Niharika S. D'Souza,Faisal Chowdhury,Horst Samulowitz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores automatic prompt optimization for triple extraction in knowledge graph construction, showing it can generate human-like prompts and improve results, especially with complex schemas and larger texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handcrafting task-specific prompts for LLMs in KG construction is labor-intensive and brittle. Automatic prompt optimization can address this challenge.

Method: The study evaluates automatic prompt optimization for triple extraction by varying prompting strategies, LLMs, schema complexity, text length, metrics, and datasets, using optimizers like DSPy, APE, and TextGrad.

Result: Automatic prompt optimization generates human-like prompts and improves triple extraction results, particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

Conclusion: Automatic prompt optimization is effective for triple extraction, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to manual prompt crafting.

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between
them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and
discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine
learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object)
extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and
has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to
more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs
is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts
for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle
changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy
generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this
challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given
input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt
optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We
evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM
being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of
canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and
diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,
and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three
different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use
two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous
empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt
optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for
triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results,
particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

*Teng Wang,Hailei Gong,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE, a strategy-guided RL framework with novel reward shaping, improves dense retrieval by leveraging expert strategies and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current query rewriting methods require large supervised data or suffer from inefficient RL exploration, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Introduces SAGE, which uses expert-crafted strategies (e.g., semantic expansion) and novel reward shaping (SCS, CRS) in an RL framework.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, reduces exploration, and lowers inference cost while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Strategy-guided RL with nuanced reward shaping offers a scalable, efficient, and interpretable paradigm for robust information retrieval.

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods
demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement
learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as
semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval
effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,
and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive
Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL
framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit
Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative
learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new
state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent
behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary
exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without
sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL,
enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more
interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information
retrieval systems.

*Menglong Zhang,Fuyuan Qian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SimBelief is a meta-RL framework that improves task identification and exploration in sparse reward settings by measuring task belief similarity in BAMDPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the challenge of suboptimal exploitation in sparse reward environments by leveraging task belief similarity.

Method: Introduces a latent task belief metric to learn common structures of similar tasks and integrates it with specific task beliefs for efficient exploration.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym tasks.

Conclusion: SimBelief enables rapid task identification and adaptation by leveraging shared latent task belief features.

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution
information obtained during exploration to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The
efficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the
current task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on
reconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse
reward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation
metrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we
propose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task
belief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common
features of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification
and exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief
metric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into
the specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task
distributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task
features, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym
tasks.

TL;DR: VLMs are used to analyze diagrams for adherence to data visualization guidelines, showing effectiveness in identifying issues like missing labels and 3D effects, though struggles with image quality and tick marks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers often misuse diagrams due to lack of adherence to visualization principles, leading to misinformation. This work aims to automate issue detection using VLMs.

Method: Five VLMs and five prompting strategies are tested on questions derived from visualization guidelines to evaluate their accuracy in analyzing diagrams.

Result: VLMs perform well in identifying diagram types, 3D effects, axes labels, and legends but poorly in assessing image quality and tick marks. Qwen2.5VL and summarizing prompting strategy excel.

Conclusion: VLMs can automate the detection of common diagram issues, offering a scalable solution to improve visualization adherence, with potential for further extension.

Abstract: Diagrams are widely used to visualize data in publications. The research
field of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for
the creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to
by researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or
incomplete information.
  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze
diagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data
visualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs
for these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are
compared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization
guidelines.
  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze
diagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels
(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score
96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the
image quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among
the employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting
strategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.
  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of
potential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and
unnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for
further aspects of data visualization.

*Guo Li,Zixiang Xu,Wei Zhang,Yikuan Hu,Xinyu Yang,Nikolay Aristov,Mingjie Tang,Elenna R Dugundji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Temporal-IRL model to predict port congestion by analyzing vessel behavior and berth scheduling, achieving excellent results using AIS data from Maher Terminal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate port congestion prediction is vital for supply chain reliability, enabling better planning, cost reduction, and timely deliveries.

Method: The study uses AIS data to reconstruct berth schedules and applies Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to model berth scheduling priorities. A Temporal-IRL model is developed for vessel sequencing and stay time prediction.

Result: The model, tested on Maher Terminal data (2015-2023), demonstrated excellent performance in forecasting port congestion.

Conclusion: The Temporal-IRL approach effectively predicts port congestion by learning berth scheduling patterns, enhancing supply chain resilience.

Abstract: Predicting port congestion is crucial for maintaining reliable global supply
chains. Accurate forecasts enableimprovedshipment planning, reducedelaysand
costs, and optimizeinventoryanddistributionstrategies, thereby ensuring timely
deliveries and enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve accurate
predictions, analyzing vessel behavior and their stay times at specific port
terminals is essential, focusing particularly on berth scheduling under various
conditions. Crucially, the model must capture and learn the underlying
priorities and patterns of berth scheduling. Berth scheduling and planning are
influenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting
times, and the status of vessels within the port terminal. By observing
historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we
reconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we
modeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed
Temporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel
sequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both
waiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion. Utilizing data from
Maher Terminal spanning January 2015 to September 2023, we trained and tested
the model, achieving demonstrably excellent results.

*Ai Han,Junxing Hu,Pu Wei,Zhiqian Zhang,Yuhang Guo,Jiawei Lu,Zicheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JoyAgents-R1 introduces Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for MARL, enhancing efficiency and stability by refining LLMs and memories through Monte Carlo sampling and adaptive memory evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing cooperative inefficiency and training instability in heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Method: Uses GRPO with Monte Carlo sampling for policy diversity and a marginal benefit-driven selection strategy for targeted updates. Adaptive memory evolution repurposes GRPO rewards to eliminate repetitive reasoning.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to larger LLMs using smaller open-source models in general and domain-specific scenarios.

Conclusion: JoyAgents-R1 effectively balances decision-making and memory capabilities, improving MARL training stability and joint benefits.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm
for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous
agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training
instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL
called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively
refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves
holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.
Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on
the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO
sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal
benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with
maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve
training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter
adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution
mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to
eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across
general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves
performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller
open-source models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HI-SQL improves Text-to-SQL generation by using historical query logs to generate hints, enhancing accuracy and efficiency for complex queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Text-to-SQL struggle with complex queries, relying on costly multi-step pipelines prone to errors.

Method: HI-SQL introduces a hint generation mechanism from historical query logs to guide SQL generation, simplifying multi-table and nested operations.

Result: Experiments show HI-SQL boosts query accuracy and efficiency, reducing LLM calls and latency.

Conclusion: HI-SQL offers a robust, practical solution for improving Text-to-SQL systems by leveraging historical data.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation bridges the gap between natural language and
databases, enabling users to query data without requiring SQL expertise. While
large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field, challenges
remain in handling complex queries that involve multi-table joins, nested
conditions, and intricate operations. Existing methods often rely on multi-step
pipelines that incur high computational costs, increase latency, and are prone
to error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose HI-SQL, a
pipeline that incorporates a novel hint generation mechanism utilizing
historical query logs to guide SQL generation. By analyzing prior queries, our
method generates contextual hints that focus on handling the complexities of
multi-table and nested operations. These hints are seamlessly integrated into
the SQL generation process, eliminating the need for costly multi-step
approaches and reducing reliance on human-crafted prompts. Experimental
evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves query accuracy of LLM-generated queries while ensuring
efficiency in terms of LLM calls and latency, offering a robust and practical
solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.

*Shuang Ao,Yi Dong,Jinwei Hu,Sarvapali Ramchurn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLoRA improves safety in fine-tuned LLMs by pruning unsafe LoRA layers, using E-DIEM for detection, and maintains performance with reduced overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs with LoRA can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing harmful outputs. Existing methods fail to address complex parameter shifts.

Method: Proposes SPLoRA, a pruning-based approach using E-DIEM to detect and remove unsafe LoRA layers, evaluated on mixed and benign datasets.

Result: SPLoRA outperforms existing safety techniques, reducing risks while preserving performance and reliability, with lower inference overhead.

Conclusion: SPLoRA is a scalable, efficient solution for safer LLMs, balancing safety and utility effectively.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
enhances adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning
can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing
susceptibility to harmful outputs. Existing safety alignment methods struggle
to capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility
trade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a
novel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken
safety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core,
we introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric
that effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct
extensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious
data, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and
reliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety
risks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability.
Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and
efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is

TL;DR: Chain-of-Experts (CoE) is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with sequential expert communication, improving performance and reducing memory usage compared to traditional MoE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the representational capacity and flexibility of MoE models by introducing iterative expert communication and dynamic routing.

Method: CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts within each layer, using dedicated routers for dynamic expert selection at each step.

Result: CoE reduces validation loss from 1.20 to 1.12 on math tasks and offers memory-efficient scaling (17.6-42% reduction).

Conclusion: CoE's iterative routing and residual structure enable expressive representations, outperforming traditional MoE while optimizing compute and memory.

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer.
Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel,
CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To
support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated
router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to
re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than
being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing
mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the
model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under
fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to
1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling
axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional
width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance
of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%
relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits
stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization
empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/ZihanWang314/coe.

TL;DR: FIM enhances MARL cooperation by targeting critical state dimensions (CoG) with intrinsic rewards and synchronized focus, improving performance in sparse reward settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of sparse rewards in MARL by improving exploration and coordinated attention among agents.

Method: FIM identifies CoG state dimensions, uses counterfactual intrinsic rewards, and employs eligibility-trace-based credit accumulation to focus agent influence.

Result: FIM significantly outperforms baselines in diverse MARL benchmarks, enabling robust cooperation under sparse rewards.

Conclusion: FIM effectively enhances MARL cooperation by directing agent influence toward critical state dimensions, proving its utility in sparse reward scenarios.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under sparse rewards
presents a fundamental challenge due to limited exploration and insufficient
coordinated attention among agents. In this work, we propose the Focusing
Influence Mechanism (FIM), a novel framework that enhances cooperation by
directing agent influence toward task-critical elements, referred to as Center
of Gravity (CoG) state dimensions, inspired by Clausewitz's military theory.
FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions
based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual
intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3)
encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based
credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and
effective state transitions, facilitating robust cooperation even in extremely
sparse reward settings. Empirical evaluations across diverse MARL benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed FIM significantly improves cooperative
performance compared to baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of untimely detection and monitoring lag in injection molding quality anomalies.

Method: Integrates mechanism-based and data-driven analysis, decouples time series and non-time series data, and uses a self-attention mechanism for feature fusion.

Result: Achieves RMSE of 0.0281, outperforming benchmarks by 15.6-25.7%. Mixed feature modeling and attention mechanism contribute 22.4% and 11.2% improvements, respectively.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient, reliable solution for intelligent quality control in injection molding, highlighting the impact of data resolution on performance.

Abstract: To address the challenges of untimely detection and online monitoring lag in
injection molding quality anomalies, this study proposes a mixed feature
attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online
prediction of product weight. By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven
analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow
dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features,
pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention
mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to
dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing
critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the
MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation
tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement
over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and
15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate
the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature
modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%),
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions
and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further
reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability,
low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to
high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and
reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding
processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridges deteriorate over time, and traffic load monitoring is crucial for assessing their service life. CV-based methods have limitations like privacy issues and lighting sensitivity, while traditional non-vision methods lack flexibility.

Method: Integrates CV-assisted dataset generation with supervised training using GNNs to capture spatial sensor data relationships. Transfers knowledge from CV to SHM sensors.

Result: Achieves 99% accuracy for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles in a real-world case study.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges the gap between CV and SHM, offering high accuracy and minimal human intervention for traffic monitoring.

Abstract: Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly
affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for
assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load
plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in
computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated
monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including
privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional
non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation.
To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for
continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor
networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset
generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural
networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor
data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed
framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of
vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer
and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light
vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.

TL;DR: The paper proposes learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks for dynamic timeseries prediction in critical care, addressing challenges faced by traditional methods like Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability is crucial for deploying deep learning models in critical care, but existing methods struggle with dynamic prediction tasks due to time-varying dependencies and temporal smoothness.

Method: The work systematically analyzes failure modes of common interpretability algorithms and supports learnable mask-based frameworks that incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints.

Result: Learnable mask-based approaches are shown to provide more reliable and consistent interpretations for dynamic timeseries prediction in critical care.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that learnable mask-based methods are superior for interpretability in dynamic prediction tasks, particularly in critical care.

Abstract: Interpretability plays a vital role in aligning and deploying deep learning
models in critical care, especially in constantly evolving conditions that
influence patient survival. However, common interpretability algorithms face
unique challenges when applied to dynamic prediction tasks, where patient
trajectories evolve over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based
methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal
smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports
learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can
incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn
feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based
approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and
consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar
domains.

*Nitish Nagesh,Ziyu Wang,Amir M. Rahmani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel LLM-augmented method for synthetic health data generation enhances causal fairness, reducing bias by 70% compared to real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of causal fairness in synthetic health data generation to ensure equitable outcomes.

Method: Develops an LLM-augmented synthetic data generation method preserving causal structure, tested on real-world tabular health data.

Result: Generated data deviates <10% on causal fairness metrics and reduces bias by 70% on sensitive attributes.

Conclusion: The method improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable health research and delivery.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation creates data based on real-world data using
generative models. In health applications, generating high-quality data while
maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable
outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual
fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal
fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving
causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address
it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented
synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world
tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real
data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors,
synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real
data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable
health research and healthcare delivery.

*Florian Grötschla,Ahmet Solak,Luca A. Lanzendörfer,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates music generation models by comparing human preferences with objective metrics, ranking models and metrics based on 15k pairwise comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing music generation models is challenging due to the subjectivity of human preference and the lack of reliable objective metrics.

Method: Generated 6k songs using 12 models and conducted a survey of 15k pairwise comparisons with 2.5k participants.

Result: Ranked state-of-the-art music generation models and metrics based on human preference.

Conclusion: Provides an open dataset to advance subjective metric evaluation in music generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements have brought generated music closer to human-created
compositions, yet evaluating these models remains challenging. While human
preference is the gold standard for assessing quality, translating these
subjective judgments into objective metrics, particularly for text-audio
alignment and music quality, has proven difficult. In this work, we generate 6k
songs using 12 state-of-the-art models and conduct a survey of 15k pairwise
audio comparisons with 2.5k human participants to evaluate the correlation
between human preferences and widely used metrics. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first to rank current state-of-the-art music
generation models and metrics based on human preference. To further the field
of subjective metric evaluation, we provide open access to our dataset of
generated music and human evaluations.

*Fanny Lehmann,Firat Ozdemir,Benedikt Soja,Torsten Hoefler,Siddhartha Mishra,Sebastian Schemm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates Aurora, an AI weather forecasting foundation model, for predicting hydrological variables not included in pretraining. A lightweight decoder approach outperforms full fine-tuning in efficiency and accuracy, highlighting the model's ability to capture physical relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if foundation models like Aurora can effectively predict new hydrological variables without full fine-tuning, making them more accessible for Earth sciences.

Method: Compare a lightweight decoder approach (trained on Aurora's latent representations) with full fine-tuning. Measure training time, memory usage, and accuracy.

Result: The decoder approach reduces training time by 50% and memory by 35%, while maintaining accuracy and preserving model stability. Accuracy depends on physical correlations with pretraining variables.

Conclusion: Foundation models should be extendable to new variables without full fine-tuning, enhancing accessibility and adoption in Earth sciences.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of
so-called "foundation models", typically defined by expensive pretraining and
minimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a
desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical
relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates
the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting
hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We
introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent
representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a
baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further
optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both
inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time
and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various
hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation
model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on
the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during
pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical
relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for
foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new
variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for
making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited
computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.

### [49] [On the algorithmic construction of deep ReLU networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19104)
*Daan Huybrechs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores neural networks as algorithms, constructing exact solutions like sorting, and analyzes their recursive and parallel nature compared to conventional algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mathematically understand what neural networks can represent, focusing on their algorithmic capabilities rather than training from data.

Method: Constructs neural networks (e.g., for sorting) explicitly, analyzing their properties like recursion, parallelism, and computational complexity.

Result: Neural networks as algorithms are recursive, parallel, and depth-dependent, with deep networks outperforming shallow ones.

Conclusion: Constructed neural networks demonstrate algorithmic expressivity, with depth and continuity constraints distinguishing them from conventional algorithms.

Abstract: It is difficult to describe in mathematical terms what a neural network
trained on data represents. On the other hand, there is a growing mathematical
understanding of what neural networks are in principle capable of representing.
Feedforward neural networks using the ReLU activation function represent
continuous and piecewise linear functions and can approximate many others. The
study of their expressivity addresses the question: which ones? Contributing to
the available answers, we take the perspective of a neural network as an
algorithm. In this analogy, a neural network is programmed constructively,
rather than trained from data. An interesting example is a sorting algorithm:
we explicitly construct a neural network that sorts its inputs exactly, not
approximately, and that, in a sense, has optimal computational complexity if
the input dimension is large. Such constructed networks may have several
billion parameters. We construct and analyze several other examples, both
existing and new. We find that, in these examples, neural networks as
algorithms are typically recursive and parallel. Compared to conventional
algorithms, ReLU networks are restricted by having to be continuous. Moreover,
the depth of recursion is limited by the depth of the network, with deep
networks having superior properties over shallow ones.

*Kenneth L. Clarkson,Lior Horesh,Takuya Ito,Charlotte Park,Parikshit Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can exactly implement Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering, offering a neural implementation and novel variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if transformers can learn and implement precise algorithms, specifically Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering.

Method: Theoretical proof and numerical implementation of a transformer architecture (k-means transformer) using attention and residual connections.

Result: Exact correspondence between the transformer and Lloyd's algorithm, with interpretable modifications yielding new clustering variants.

Conclusion: Transformers can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, providing interpretable implementations of algorithms.

Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial
Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural
language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these
advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement
precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly
implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:
Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a
transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly
implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard
ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,
we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the
exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing
a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate
that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or
multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants
of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed
$k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer
mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and
interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

*Andreas Bjerregaard,Søren Hauberg,Anders Krogh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Riemannian generative decoder that simplifies manifold-valued representation learning by eliminating the encoder and using a Riemannian optimizer for maximum likelihood latents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Riemannian representation learning methods involve complex density approximations and manifold constraints, which can harm model performance and limit applicability to specific manifolds.

Method: The proposed method discards the encoder and trains a decoder network with a Riemannian optimizer to find manifold-valued maximum likelihood latents.

Result: Validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, the method captures non-Euclidean structure and respects prescribed geometry while simplifying manifold constraints.

Conclusion: The approach is simpler, compatible with existing architectures, and produces interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating
densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives,
potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce
the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum
likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder
network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint
compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds.
We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching
diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells
undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations
respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure.
Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures,
and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned using local rules, applied to nonlinear oscillators for sampling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how SGMs can be adapted for practical applications using local learning rules and physical systems.

Method: Uses gradient-based parameter learning from force measurements or dynamics, implemented in a network of nonlinear oscillators.

Result: Successfully samples from Gaussian mixtures and MNIST digits using a 10x10 oscillator network.

Conclusion: Local learning rules enable practical implementation of SGMs in physical systems for generative tasks.

Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based
generative models (SGMs) can be learned via a local learning rule. The gradient
with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly
from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration,
we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators
coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a
mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10
oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.

*Barry Wang,Avi Schwarzschild,Alexander Robey,Ali Payani,Charles Fleming,Mingjie Sun,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Command-V is a backpropagation-free method for transferring behaviors between LLMs by copying and adapting residual activations, requiring minimal compute and no original training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To avoid costly full finetuning or distillation for behavior transfer in LLMs, which must be repeated for each architecture.

Method: Profiles layer activations, derives linear converters between layers, and applies donor interventions in the recipient's activation space.

Result: Matches or exceeds direct finetuning performance in safety-refusal, jailbreak, and chain-of-thought tasks with much less compute.

Conclusion: Command-V offers an efficient, data-free alternative to traditional behavior transfer methods.

Abstract: Retrofitting large language models (LLMs) with new behaviors typically
requires full finetuning or distillation-costly steps that must be repeated for
every architecture. In this work, we introduce Command-V, a
backpropagation-free behavior transfer method that copies an existing residual
activation adapter from a donor model and pastes its effect into a recipient
model. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives
linear converters between corresponding layers, and applies the donor
intervention in the recipient's activation space. This process does not require
access to the original training data and needs minimal compute. In three case
studies-safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic
chain-of-thought reasoning--Command-V matches or exceeds the performance of
direct finetuning while using orders of magnitude less compute. Our code and
data are accessible at https://github.com/GithuBarry/Command-V/.

### [54] [Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19143)
*Paul C. Bogdan,Uzay Macar,Neel Nanda,Arthur Conmy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces three methods to analyze sentence-level reasoning traces in large language models, identifying "thought anchors"—key reasoning steps that disproportionately influence the process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address interpretability challenges in long-form chain-of-thought reasoning by decomposing the computation at the sentence level.

Method: Three attribution methods: (1) black-box counterfactual importance, (2) white-box attention pattern aggregation, and (3) causal attribution via attention suppression.

Result: Identification of "thought anchors"—critical reasoning steps (e.g., planning or backtracking sentences) that heavily influence subsequent reasoning.

Conclusion: Sentence-level analysis is promising for understanding reasoning models, supported by consistent findings across methods and a provided visualization tool.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning
creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all
previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that
analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to
understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution
methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual
importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the
model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box
method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which
identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention
from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal
attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by
suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each
future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of
thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that
disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought
anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an
open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our
methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods
that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across
methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper
understanding of reasoning models.

*Amir Faiyaz,Tara Salman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradualDiff-Fed is a federated learning framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) efficiently by transmitting only weight differences, reducing communication costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for privacy-preserving, decentralized fine-tuning of LLMs in specialized domains like medical science, addressing challenges in performance and large model sizes.

Method: Introduces GradualDiff-Fed, which transmits only model weight differences during training rounds to reduce communication costs and improve scalability.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to centralized training while significantly reducing communication overhead.

Conclusion: GradualDiff-Fed is an efficient solution for privacy-preserving fine-tuning of large models from distributed data without compromising performance.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an
unprecedented demand for fine-tuning models for specialized domains, such as
medical science. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and
privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing
raw data, it presents significant challenges, particularly in performance and
managing large model sizes efficiently. In this paper, we introduce
GradualDiff-Fed, an FL framework designed explicitly for LLMs, and their
challenge of handling the high parameter size. GradualDiff-Fed reduces
communication costs by transmitting only the difference of model weights rather
than the entire model during training rounds. Such an approach significantly
improves scalability and communication efficiency, making it more feasible to
fine-tune LLMs across distributed clients without compromising performance. Our
evaluation demonstrates that GradualDiff-Fed achieves performance on par with
centralized training while drastically reducing communication overhead. These
results highlight the potential of GradualDiff-Fed as an efficient solution for
fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings
without comprising performance.

*Xingyue Huang,Xianglong Hu,Zifeng Ding,Yuan He,Rishabh,Waleed Alzarooni,Ziyu Ye,Wendong Fan,Bailan He,Haige Bo,Changran Hu,Guohao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to distill tool knowledge into LLMs using natural language, improving their performance on math problems without requiring tools at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with exact computation and multi-step algebraic reasoning, and while tool-integrated reasoning helps, it introduces scalability issues.

Method: A Solver Agent solves problems using planning, tool calls, and reflection. A back-translation pipeline converts these traces into natural language reasoning traces, which are used to fine-tune a small model.

Result: The fine-tuned model internalizes tool knowledge and reasoning patterns, improving performance on math benchmarks without tool access.

Conclusion: The approach successfully distills tool knowledge into LLMs, enhancing their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical problems that
require exact computation or multi-step algebraic reasoning. Tool-integrated
reasoning (TIR) offers a promising solution by leveraging external tools such
as code interpreters to ensure correctness, but it introduces inference-time
dependencies that hinder scalability and deployment. In this work, we propose a
new paradigm for distilling tool knowledge into LLMs purely through natural
language. We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by
interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then,
using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we
convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A
Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a
Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative.
Empirically, we show that fine-tuning a small open-source model on these
synthesized traces enables it to internalize both tool knowledge and structured
reasoning patterns, yielding gains on competition-level math benchmarks without
requiring tool access at inference.

### [57] [Private Model Personalization Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19220)
*Conor Snedeker,Xinyu Zhou,Raef Bassily*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a differentially private federated learning algorithm for model personalization, improving privacy and utility guarantees under heterogeneous user data and noisy labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of privately recovering shared embeddings and local representations in federated learning with heterogeneous data and noisy labels.

Method: A private, efficient federated learning algorithm based on FedRep, incorporating differential privacy and handling sub-Gaussian user distributions.

Result: Improved privacy error terms and dimension-independent risk bounds under margin loss, outperforming prior work.

Conclusion: The method successfully achieves private model personalization with enhanced utility and broader applicability.

Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in
the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose
data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an
unknown embedding $U^* \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ that maps the user parameters
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\mathbb{R}^k$, where
$k\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local
low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated
setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn
the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike
[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold
for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model
personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of
users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).
Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term
in [JRS+21] by a factor of $\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary
classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to
privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy
guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the
shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that
dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin
loss.

TL;DR: The paper explores high-precision training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for unbounded domains, focusing on singularity formation in PDEs. It proposes a modular approach, evaluates neural network choices, and demonstrates improved results for 1D Burgers and 2D Boussinesq equations.

Motivation: To enhance the precision of PINNs for studying singularities in PDEs, particularly in unbounded domains, and to bridge numerical solutions with rigorous analysis.

Method: A modularized approach involving neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization algorithm, combined with computer-assisted proofs and PDE analysis.

Result: Achieved high-precision solutions for 1D Burgers equation and improved loss for 2D Boussinesq equation compared to prior work.

Conclusion: PINNs, when trained with high precision, are effective for singularity studies, with potential for further advancements in higher-dimensional problems.

Abstract: We investigate the high-precision training of Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) in unbounded domains, with a special focus on applications to
singularity formulation in PDEs. We propose a modularized approach and study
the choices of neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization
algorithm. When combined with rigorous computer-assisted proofs and PDE
analysis, the numerical solutions identified by PINNs, provided they are of
high precision, can serve as a powerful tool for studying singularities in
PDEs. For 1D Burgers equation, our framework can lead to a solution with very
high precision, and for the 2D Boussinesq equation, which is directly related
to the singularity formulation in 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, we
obtain a solution whose loss is $4$ digits smaller than that obtained in
\cite{wang2023asymptotic} with fewer training steps. We also discuss potential
directions for pushing towards machine precision for higher-dimensional
problems.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical foundation for kernel methods in non-Euclidean domains, validating their applicability to manifold-valued data.

Abstract: The universality properties of kernels characterize the class of functions
that can be approximated in the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space and
are of fundamental importance in the theoretical underpinning of kernel methods
in machine learning. In this work, we establish fundamental tools for
investigating universality properties of kernels in Riemannian symmetric
spaces, thereby extending the study of this important topic to kernels in
non-Euclidean domains. Moreover, we use the developed tools to prove the

TL;DR: The paper proposes a federated contrastive learning method for anomaly detection in distributed systems, addressing privacy, heterogeneity, and pattern recognition challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of centralized anomaly detection methods, particularly in data privacy, node heterogeneity, and fine-grained anomaly recognition.

Method: Combines federated learning and contrastive learning to build local embeddings, optimize a global model without raw data exposure, and train using contrastive and classification losses.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively handling complex anomalies in distributed environments.

Conclusion: The method balances privacy and performance, offering a viable solution for intelligent security in distributed systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection
in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated
contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional
centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and
anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed
collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature
discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding
representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample
pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.
Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a
federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to
represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system
logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both
contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect
fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical
attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario
to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It
demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing
complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key
modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method
achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It
offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in
distributed systems.

*Hadi Khalaf,Claudio Mayrink Verdun,Alex Oesterling,Himabindu Lakkaraju,Flavio du Pin Calmon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses reward hacking in large language models (LLMs) due to imperfect reward models, proposing hedging strategies like HedgeTune to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models, though useful, can be misspecified, leading to reward hacking where alignment goals are subverted. This work aims to characterize and mitigate this issue.

Method: The study analyzes reward hacking under Best-of-$n$ (BoN), Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and introduces Best-of-Poisson (BoP). HedgeTune is proposed to optimize inference-time parameters.

Result: Hedging mitigates reward hacking and achieves better distortion-reward tradeoffs with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Hedging is an effective tactical choice to avoid overconfidence in proxy rewards, improving alignment and performance in LLMs.

Abstract: A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is
optimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM
outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a
user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never
perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as
correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified
reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance
-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we
characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when
and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this
phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we
introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact
approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We
show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where
the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of
a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter
this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence
in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce
HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter
and avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging
mitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with
minimal computational overhead.

### [62] [Robust Behavior Cloning Via Global Lipschitz Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19250)
*Shili Wu,Yizhao Jin,Puhua Niu,Aniruddha Datta,Sean B. Andersson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using global Lipschitz regularization to enhance the robustness of Behavior Cloning (BC) policies against measurement errors and adversarial disturbances, providing a robustness certificate and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BC policies are vulnerable to deviations in observations due to errors or adversarial disturbances, leading to sub-optimal actions.

Method: A global Lipschitz regularization approach is applied to the policy network, ensuring robustness against bounded norm perturbations. A Lipschitz neural network construction method is also proposed.

Result: The method provides a robustness certificate for the policy and is empirically validated in various Gymnasium environments.

Conclusion: Lipschitz regularization effectively improves the robustness of BC policies, making them more reliable in safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has
even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles.
BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset
composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any
additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the
policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances.
Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the
agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz
regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy
network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a
robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm
perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network
that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across
various environments in Gymnasium. Keywords: Robust Reinforcement Learning;

TL;DR: The paper addresses performance drops in Graph OOD classification by tackling minority class underperformance and sensitivity to structural noise. It proposes CMO and NNR methods, validated with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Graph OOD classification, especially for minority classes under imbalance and structural noise.

Method: Proposes Constrained Mean Optimization (CMO) for minority class robustness and Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) for noise mitigation.

Result: Significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and classification accuracy, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address minority class challenges and noise sensitivity in Graph OOD classification.

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classification often suffers from sharp
performance drops, particularly under category imbalance and structural noise.
This work tackles two pressing challenges in this context: (1) the
underperformance of minority classes due to skewed label distributions, and (2)
their heightened sensitivity to structural noise in graph data. To address
these problems, we propose two complementary solutions. First, Constrained Mean
Optimization (CMO) improves minority class robustness by encouraging
similarity-based instance aggregation under worst-case conditions. Second, the
Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) mechanism assigns dynamic weights to
training samples based on local structural consistency, mitigating noise
influence. We provide theoretical justification for our methods, and validate
their effectiveness with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and
classification accuracy. The code for our method is available at:

*Yang Zhou,Xiaoning Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BADGNN addresses temporal continuity loss in MDGNNs by introducing TLR and A3, enabling larger batches and faster training without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large batch training in MDGNNs disrupts event sequences, causing temporal information loss and hindering optimization.

Method: BADGNN uses Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space and Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to mitigate attention distortion.

Result: BADGNN outperforms TGN, maintaining performance with larger batches and faster training on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: BADGNN effectively preserves temporal continuity and improves training efficiency in dynamic graph neural networks.

Abstract: In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However,
Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches
often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This
discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders
optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our
theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that
large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose
BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1)
Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space
expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention
distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on
three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while
enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

### [65] [Efficient Extreme Operating Condition Search for Online Relay Setting Calculation in Renewable Power Systems Based on Parallel Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19289)
*Yan Li,Zengli Yang,Youhuai Wang,Jing Wang,Xiaoyu Han,Jingyu Wang,Dongyuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning-based method (PGNN) for the Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem in relay setting calculation, improving accuracy and computation speed for online applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The volatility of renewable energy systems demands faster online relay setting calculations, but existing methods are too slow.

Method: A parallel graph neural network (PGNN) processes power system data (four layers: component parameters, topology, electrical distance, graph distance) to predict extreme conditions.

Result: PGNN outperforms existing methods in accuracy and significantly reduces computation time on IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems.

Conclusion: The PGNN method is efficient and accurate for online EOCS, addressing the challenges posed by renewable energy integration.

Abstract: The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key
problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting
values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of
power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of
renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the
operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the
adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the
computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration,
heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency
requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead,
this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS
method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system
information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a
topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph
distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model
for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each
node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to
predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed
PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems,
where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation
units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered
when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed
PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the
EOCS problem. Meanwhile, it also provides greater improvements in online
computation time.

### [66] [The Effect of Depth on the Expressivity of Deep Linear State-Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19296)
*Zeyu Bao,Penghao Yu,Haotian Jiang,Qianxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep linear SSMs' expressiveness depends on depth and width. Without constraints, depth and width are equivalent; with norm constraints, depth outperforms. Theoretical bounds and experiments validate this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how depth and width affect the expressive capacity of deep linear state-space models (SSMs), especially under parameter norm constraints.

Method: Systematic investigation of depth and width in deep linear SSMs, including theoretical proofs and numerical experiments.

Result: Without constraints, depth and width are equivalent; with norm constraints, deep SSMs outperform shallow ones in representing targets with large norms. Upper bounds on minimal depth are derived.

Conclusion: Deep linear SSMs are more expressive under norm constraints, with depth playing a critical role. Theoretical findings are supported by experiments.

Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs) have gained increasing popularity in sequence
modelling. While there are numerous theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs,
how the depth of the SSM affects its expressiveness remains a crucial problem.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the role of depth and width in
deep linear SSMs, aiming to characterize how they influence the expressive
capacity of the architecture. First, we rigorously prove that in the absence of
parameter constraints, increasing depth and increasing width are generally
equivalent, provided that the parameter count remains within the same order of
magnitude. However, under the assumption that the parameter norms are
constrained, the effects of depth and width differ significantly. We show that
a shallow linear SSM with large parameter norms can be represented by a deep
linear SSM with smaller norms using a constructive method. In particular, this
demonstrates that deep SSMs are more capable of representing targets with large
norms than shallow SSMs under norm constraints. Finally, we derive upper bounds
on the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given
shallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms. We also validate our
theoretical results with numerical experiments

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial attacks can evade Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids. A novel attack framework using the Fast Gradient Sign Method is proposed, showing high success rates. Adversarial training is introduced as a defense, improving model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in DLSs for FDIA detection in smart grids and propose a defense mechanism.

Method: Proposes an adversarial attack framework using the Fast Gradient Sign Method to exploit DLS vulnerabilities. Evaluates robustness of various deep learning models under adversarial conditions.

Result: Existing models are highly vulnerable, with attack success rates exceeding 99.7%. Adversarial training significantly improves robustness without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to DLS-based FDIA detection. Adversarial training is an effective defense, emphasizing the need for robust cybersecurity in smart grids.

Abstract: The application of Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids has attracted significant
attention. This paper demonstrates that adversarial attacks, carefully crafted
FDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current
Differential Relays (LCDRs). We propose a novel adversarial attack framework,
utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by
introducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to
misclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the
LCDR to trip. We evaluate the robustness of multiple deep learning models,
including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, long
short-term memory networks, and residual networks, under adversarial
conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models
perform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial
attacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%. To
address this threat, we introduce adversarial training as a proactive defense
mechanism, significantly enhancing the models' ability to withstand adversarial
FDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy. Our results highlight the
significant threat posed by adversarial attacks to DLS-based FDIA detection,
underscore the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures in smart grids, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing model
robustness against adversarial FDIAs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CroMoTEX is a contrastive learning framework that uses chest X-rays to enhance ECG representations for diagnosing cardiac pathologies, outperforming baselines with up to 78.31 AUROC on edema.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage multimodal data (ECGs and CXRs) for improved cardiac diagnosis, focusing on accessibility and scalability where CXRs may not be available.

Method: Uses a supervised cross-modal contrastive objective with adaptive hard negative weighting to align ECG and CXR representations during training, then relies solely on ECG input at test time.

Result: Outperforms baselines on cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema, achieving up to 78.31 AUROC on edema.

Conclusion: CroMoTEX enables robust ECG-based diagnosis by leveraging CXR data during training, offering scalable deployment in real-world settings.

Abstract: Modern diagnostic workflows are increasingly multimodal, integrating diverse
data sources such as medical images, structured records, and physiological time
series. Among these, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and chest X-rays (CXRs) are two
of the most widely used modalities for cardiac assessment. While CXRs provide
rich diagnostic information, ECGs are more accessible and can support scalable
early warning systems. In this work, we propose CroMoTEX, a novel contrastive
learning-based framework that leverages chest X-rays during training to learn
clinically informative ECG representations for multiple cardiac-related
pathologies: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema. Our method aligns ECG
and CXR representations using a novel supervised cross-modal contrastive
objective with adaptive hard negative weighting, enabling robust and
task-relevant feature learning. At test time, CroMoTEX relies solely on ECG
input, allowing scalable deployment in real-world settings where CXRs may be
unavailable. Evaluated on the large-scale MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR datasets,
CroMoTEX outperforms baselines across all three pathologies, achieving up to
78.31 AUROC on edema. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) in crash data using database narrative alignment and BERT model, revealing 24.03% AIM in Iowa crash records (2016-2022). Findings highlight mismatches in crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older drivers, suggesting targeted training and data management improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate crash data is crucial for prevention strategies and policy development, but alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) poses a challenge.

Method: Employed database narrative alignment and BERT model to analyze 371,062 Iowa crash records (2016-2022), using statistical tools like Probit Logit model.

Result: Identified 2,767 AIM incidents (24.03% overall). Alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents had lower mismatch, while unknown vehicle types and older drivers had higher mismatch.

Conclusion: Targeted training and improved data management are needed to enhance crash reporting accuracy and support evidence-based policymaking.

Abstract: Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities,
emphasizing the urgent need for accurate crash data to enhance prevention
strategies and inform policy development. This study addresses the challenge of
alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to
identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality
in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing
the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022)
revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%.
Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the
crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that
alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage
of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older
drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of
this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education
and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training
programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting
and support evidence-based policymaking.

*Ziyu Zheng,Yaming Yang,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao,Weigang Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGMAE improves graph representation learning by reconstructing discrepancy information in heterophilic graphs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in heterophilic graphs by ignoring node discrepancies, leading to indistinguishable representations.

Method: Proposes DGMAE, which reconstructs discrepancy information of neighboring nodes during masking.

Result: DGMAE preserves node discrepancies and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification, clustering, and graph classification.

Conclusion: DGMAE is a superior solution for graph self-supervised learning, especially in heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training
paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation
learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to
recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to
heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they
focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the
discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable
node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a
Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more
distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy
information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct
extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show
that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in
low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic
including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification,
demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at

*Puneesh Deora,Bhavya Vasudeva,Tina Behnia,Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers in ICL adapt to hierarchical task complexities, favoring simpler explanations when possible, and exhibit Bayesian Occam's razor behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers handle tasks of varying complexity in ICL, especially when examples support multiple hypotheses.

Method: Designed testbeds (Markov chains, linear regression) to study transformers' complexity-level identification and parameter inference. Analyzed model behavior theoretically and empirically.

Result: Transformers prefer least complex sufficient explanations and balance model fit with complexity penalties, akin to Bayesian Occam's razor.

Conclusion: Transformers trained on diverse tasks inherently exhibit Occam's razor-like inductive bias, validated with GPT-4.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through
contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has
typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language
models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper
investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where
higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by
simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and
linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate
complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding
parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple
complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler
processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient
explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian
framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context
Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We
further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution,
inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's
razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function
tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on
diverse task distributions.

TL;DR: Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS) is introduced for efficient EMS design, reducing evaluation costs by 75-85% compared to generative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations in EMS design challenge existing data-intensive methods.

Method: PQS uses quadtree-based hierarchical representation and consistency-driven sample selection to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: PQS outperforms baselines, achieving satisfactory designs under limited budgets and saving 20.27-38.80 days in design cycles.

Conclusion: PQS offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for EMS design, reducing reliance on accurate predictors and evaluations.

Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing
advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to
high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing
methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate
evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale
and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called
Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the
high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a
quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from
global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly
accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection
mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing
exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS
on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective
Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can
achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming
baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts
evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product
designing cycle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) offer a principled approach for solving
complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, scaling them to handle
more complex PDEs requires increasing the number of Fourier modes, which
significantly expands the number of model parameters and makes hyperparameter
tuning computationally impractical. To address this, we introduce
$\mu$Transfer-FNO, a zero-shot hyperparameter transfer technique that enables
optimal configurations, tuned on smaller FNOs, to be directly applied to
billion-parameter FNOs without additional tuning. Building on the Maximal
Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) framework, we mathematically derive a
parametrization scheme that facilitates the transfer of optimal hyperparameters
across models with different numbers of Fourier modes in FNOs, which is
validated through extensive experiments on various PDEs. Our empirical study
shows that Transfer-FNO reduces computational cost for tuning hyperparameters
on large FNOs while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A tag-based causal discovery method improves robustness by assigning multiple tags to variables, leveraging existing causal discovery techniques to direct edges and enhance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional type-based causal discovery lacks flexibility due to single-type assignments, limiting robustness in causal direction inference.

Method: Proposes a tag-based approach where multiple tags per variable guide edge direction using existing causal discovery methods and tag relations.

Result: Experimental results show improved causal discovery accuracy and alignment with common knowledge.

Conclusion: The tag-based method enhances flexibility and robustness in causal discovery compared to single-type approaches.

Abstract: Not every causal relation between variables is equal, and this can be
leveraged for the task of causal discovery. Recent research shows that pairs of
variables with particular type assignments induce a preference on the causal
direction of other pairs of variables with the same type. Although useful, this
assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We
propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned
to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are
first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge
relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the
undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the
assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being
restricted to single types for each variable. Our experimental evaluations show
that this boosts causal discovery and that these high-level tag relations fit
common knowledge.

TL;DR: A method to reduce overestimation bias in Q-values using distributional RL, improving existing algorithms with minimal code changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing bias in Q-value estimation, which slows convergence in Q-learning and actor-critic methods.

Method: Proposes a locally adaptive overestimation control framework built on distributional RL, compatible with existing algorithms like double Q-learning.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo environments.

Conclusion: The method is simple to implement and enhances existing distributional RL algorithms.

Abstract: Bias problems in the estimation of $Q$-values are a well-known obstacle that
slows down convergence of $Q$-learning and actor-critic methods. One of the
reasons of the success of modern RL algorithms is partially a direct or
indirect overestimation reduction mechanism. We propose an easy to implement
method built on top of distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms
to deal with the overestimation in a locally adaptive way. Our framework is
simple to implement, existing distributional algorithms can be improved with a
few lines of code. We provide theoretical evidence and use double $Q$-learning
to show how to include locally adaptive overestimation control in existing
algorithms. Experiments are provided for tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing equivariant GNNs struggle with efficiency and performance on large or sparsified graphs.

Method: FastEGNN uses virtual nodes with distinct message passing and MMD minimization. DistEGNN extends this for distributed graphs.

Result: Superior efficiency and performance on benchmarks like N-body systems and Fluid113K.

Conclusion: The models advance large-scale equivariant graph learning, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face
critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and
suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified
for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for
large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small
ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered
graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and
aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual
distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual
and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables
FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale
sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,
a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between
subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically
reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our
models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein
dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark
(113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance,
establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning. Code

### [79] [Recalling The Forgotten Class Memberships: Unlearned Models Can Be Noisy Labelers to Leak Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19486)
*Zhihao Sui,Liang Hu,Jian Cao,Dora D. Liu,Usman Naseem,Zhongyuan Lai,Qi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework to recover class memberships from unlearned models without needing the original model, highlighting vulnerabilities in Machine Unlearning (MU) technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MU attack research requires access to original models, violating privacy goals. This study explores recalling forgotten class memberships from unlearned models to address this gap.

Method: The MRA framework uses a teacher-student knowledge distillation architecture, treating unlearned models as noisy labelers and translating the problem into Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL).

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods show MRA effectively recovers class memberships of unlearned instances.

Conclusion: The study establishes a benchmark for future research on MU vulnerabilities, demonstrating significant privacy risks in unlearning methods.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence
of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid
advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored,
posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly
unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access
to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical
privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an
innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned
models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we
implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student
knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to
transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning
with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the
forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with
multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high
efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result,
our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU
vulnerabilities.

*Zhihao Sui,Liang Hu,Jian Cao,Usman Naseem,Zhongyuan Lai,Qi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces COLUR, a framework for restoring model performance degraded by noisy labels, using a neuroscience-inspired unlearning and relearning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large models degrade with noisy labels; existing solutions are limited. Neuroscience's forgetting mechanism inspires a solution.

Method: COLUR uses co-training to unlearn noisy labels and refine model confidence for relearning.

Result: COLUR outperforms SOTA methods on four real datasets.

Conclusion: COLUR effectively restores model performance degraded by noisy labels.

Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved significant success in various
tasks. However, the performance of a model can significantly degrade if it is
needed to train on datasets with noisy labels with misleading or ambiguous
information. To date, there are limited investigations on how to restore
performance when model degradation has been incurred by noisy label data.
Inspired by the ``forgetting mechanism'' in neuroscience, which enables
accelerating the relearning of correct knowledge by unlearning the wrong
knowledge, we propose a robust model restoration and refinement (MRR) framework
COLUR, namely Confidence-Oriented Learning, Unlearning and Relearning.
Specifically, we implement COLUR with an efficient co-training architecture to
unlearn the influence of label noise, and then refine model confidence on each
label for relearning. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real datasets
and all evaluation results show that COLUR consistently outperforms other SOTA
methods after MRR.

### [81] [Dimension Reduction for Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19537)
*Paul Kahlmeyer,Markus Fischer,Joachim Giesen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve symbolic regression by identifying and substituting variable combinations, enhancing algorithm performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression struggles with complex formulas due to increasing variables and operators. Naturally occurring formulas often have fixed variable combinations, which can simplify the problem if identified.

Method: The method involves searching for small valid substitutions in the expression space and testing their validity via functional dependence. This iterative dimension reduction is compatible with any symbolic regression approach.

Result: The approach reliably identifies valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

Conclusion: The iterative dimension reduction method effectively simplifies symbolic regression by leveraging variable combinations, improving algorithm efficiency.

Abstract: Solutions of symbolic regression problems are expressions that are composed
of input variables and operators from a finite set of function symbols. One
measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to
recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not
unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more
complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger.
Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed
combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one
new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables.
However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this
challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and
testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional
dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used
with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies
valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types
of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

### [82] [Overtuning in Hyperparameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19540)
*Lennart Schneider,Bernd Bischl,Matthias Feurer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates overtuning, a form of overfitting in hyperparameter optimization (HPO), where excessive optimization of validation error harms generalization. It analyzes its prevalence and severity, finding it common but usually mild, with 10% of cases leading to worse performance than default settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if excessive HPO can lead to overfitting (overtuning) and assess its impact on model generalization.

Method: Formally defines overtuning, distinguishes it from related concepts, and conducts a large-scale reanalysis of HPO benchmark data.

Result: Overtuning is more common than assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe, affecting 10% of cases. Factors like dataset size and HPO method influence it.

Conclusion: Awareness of overtuning is needed, especially for small datasets, and further mitigation strategies should be explored.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter
configuration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen
data. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is
estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This
approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to
improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are
inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question
arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting
at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk
minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term
overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical
relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML
literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it
from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale
reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of
overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously
assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,
overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse
generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further
analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset
size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss
mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of
overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further
mitigation strategies should be studied.

### [83] [Discovering Symmetries of ODEs by Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19550)
*Paul Kahlmeyer,Niklas Merk,Joachim Giesen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using symbolic regression to find Lie point symmetries for solving ODEs, outperforming traditional CAS methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated solving of nonlinear ODEs is challenging, and existing CAS methods struggle with finding Lie point symmetries.

Method: Adapts search-based symbolic regression to identify generators of Lie point symmetries.

Result: Successfully finds symmetries that existing CASs cannot detect.

Conclusion: Symbolic regression offers a promising alternative for solving complex ODEs by uncovering hidden symmetries.

Abstract: Solving systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is essential when
it comes to understanding the behavior of dynamical systems. Yet, automated
solving remains challenging, in particular for nonlinear systems. Computer
algebra systems (CASs) provide support for solving ODEs by first simplifying
them, in particular through the use of Lie point symmetries. Finding these
symmetries is, however, itself a difficult problem for CASs. Recent works in
symbolic regression have shown promising results for recovering symbolic
expressions from data. Here, we adapt search-based symbolic regression to the
task of finding generators of Lie point symmetries. With this approach, we can
find symmetries of ODEs that existing CASs cannot find.

### [84] [ConCM: Consistency-Driven Calibration and Matching for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19558)
*QinZhe Wang,Zixuan Chen,Keke Huang,Xiu Su,Chunhua Yang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConCM, a framework for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) that optimizes feature-structure dual consistency to mitigate knowledge conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for FSCIL suffer from prototype deviation and fixed embedding spaces, limiting expressiveness. The paper aims to enhance feature and structure consistency.

Method: Proposes ConCM with memory-aware prototype calibration for semantic attribute generalization and dynamic structure matching for adaptive feature alignment.

Result: ConCM outperforms existing methods by 3.20% and 3.68% on mini-ImageNet and CUB200 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses FSCIL challenges by ensuring geometric optimality and maximum matching without class-number priors.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

*Pengpeng Ouyang,Dong Chen,Tong Yang,Shuo Feng,Zhao Jin,Mingliang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAF is a framework for few-shot time series forecasting, combining generalized and task-specific features to improve accuracy with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multi-task and few-shot forecasting, where traditional methods fail due to insufficient historical data and lack of feature generalization.

Method: FAF includes three modules: GKM for generalized features, TSM for task-specific dynamics, and RM to dynamically combine them during testing.

Result: FAF outperforms baselines, achieving a 41.81% improvement on CO2 emissions data.

Conclusion: FAF enables robust and personalized forecasting with sparse data, demonstrating superior performance in few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting tasks are commonly
encountered in scenarios such as the launch of new products in different
cities. However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from
insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized
and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,
we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which
consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the
Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,
the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to
extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is
trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,
each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing
phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the
TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the
generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This
design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with
sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world
datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three
categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a
41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$
emissions dataset.

*Thomas Decker,Volker Tresp,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how uncertainty calibration affects perturbation-based explanations in ML models, introduces ReCalX to improve explanation reliability, and validates its effectiveness with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of perturbation-based explanations due to poor uncertainty calibration in ML models.

Method: Introduces ReCalX, a recalibration approach for models to enhance explanation quality without altering original predictions.

Result: Experiments show ReCalX improves explanation alignment with human perception and actual object locations.

Conclusion: ReCalX effectively enhances the reliability of perturbation-based explanations by improving model calibration.

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the
transparency of modern machine-learning models. However, their reliability is
often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific
perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between
uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual
accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models frequently
produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to
explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this
directly undermines explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX,
a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved perturbation-based
explanations while preserving their original predictions. Experiments on
popular computer vision models demonstrate that our calibration strategy
produces explanations that are more aligned with human perception and actual
object locations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an open dataset of QI-like stellarator plasma boundaries, paired with equilibria and metrics, to address bottlenecks in stellarator optimization. It includes three benchmarks and aims to facilitate data-driven approaches and cross-disciplinary progress in fusion energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized optimization problems and datasets for QI stellarator configurations hinders broader community progress in fusion energy research.

Method: The authors generate a dataset by sampling QI fields and optimizing plasma boundaries, then introduce three benchmarks with reference code and baselines.

Result: The dataset and benchmarks enable efficient generation of novel configurations using learned models, reducing reliance on expensive physics simulations.

Conclusion: Openly releasing the dataset and benchmarks lowers barriers for researchers and accelerates progress toward commercial fusion energy.

Abstract: Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to
deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a
high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive
physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma
physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more
accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by
the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and
datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic
(QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial
fusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we
release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes,
paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance
metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and
optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three
optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective
geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3)
a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs
between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide
reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical
optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our
dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without
querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with
benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for
optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design
and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to
the grid.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and coherent forecasting across temporal scales is critical for business decision-making but remains an open challenge.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical architecture with specialized modules for different temporal aggregation levels, encoding average behavior in hidden layers.

Result: Validated on the M5 dataset, the architecture outperforms established methods like TSMixer.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively addresses the challenge of coherent forecasting across temporal hierarchies.

Abstract: Coherently forecasting the behaviour of a target variable across both coarse
and fine temporal scales is crucial for profit-optimized decision-making in
several business applications, and remains an open research problem in temporal
hierarchical forecasting. Here, we propose a new hierarchical architecture that
tackles this problem by leveraging modules that specialize in forecasting the
different temporal aggregation levels of interest. The architecture, which
learns to encode the average behaviour of the target variable within its hidden
layers, makes accurate and coherent forecasts across the target temporal
hierarchies. We validate our architecture on the challenging, real-world M5
dataset and show that it outperforms established methods, such as the TSMixer
model.

*Alan N. Amin,Andres Potapczynski,Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepWAS uses fast linear algebra to train large neural networks for genetic prediction, improving performance by optimizing likelihood rather than summary statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geneticists face bottlenecks in training predictive models due to expensive linear algebra problems, limiting model size and flexibility.

Method: Leverages modern fast linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS, enabling training of large neural networks to optimize likelihood.

Result: Larger models improve performance only with full likelihood training, not summary statistics. More features enhance predictions.

Conclusion: DeepWAS enhances disease prediction and therapeutic target identification by enabling larger, more flexible models.

Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes --
traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and
measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to
build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic
features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby
DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might
expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is
bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because
variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion
of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting
small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full
likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast
linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association
Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models
to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve
performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting
traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small
ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions,
potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target
identification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces e-conformal prediction with Hoeffding's inequality to reuse a single calibration set for reliable uncertainty quantification in machine learning, validated on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ICP requires fresh calibration sets for each prediction, which is impractical. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: Combines e-conformal prediction with Hoeffding's inequality to modify Markov's inequality, enabling reuse of a calibration set.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of maintaining provable performance while reducing calibration needs, tested on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: The approach enhances practicality of conformal prediction by minimizing repeated calibration without sacrificing reliability.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for the trustworthiness of
machine learning applications. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a
distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with
user-specified confidence. However, standard ICP guarantees are marginal and
typically require a fresh calibration set for each new prediction to maintain
their validity. This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating
how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can
enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of
preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a
Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's
inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable
confidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable
performance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by
reducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly
available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHLieNet introduces a framework to learn global mappings for dynamical systems, enabling smooth transitions across parameter regimes and outperforming baselines in forecasting and capturing long-term dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parametric variability in dynamical systems leads to challenges in generalization across parameter regimes, requiring a unified model for diverse behaviors.

Method: PHLieNet learns a global mapping from parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and a mapping to weights of a dynamics propagation network, using a hypernetwork to generate target network weights.

Result: PHLieNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in short-term forecasting and capturing long-term dynamical features like attractor statistics.

Conclusion: PHLieNet provides a robust framework for modeling dynamical systems across varying parameters, enhancing generalization and performance.

Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and
decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations
in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to
drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for
constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we
introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks
(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from
the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the
inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The
learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base
network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a
target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution
conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of
models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across
parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the
dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The
performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical
systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and
extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were
unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in
capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.

TL;DR: Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP) prevents extreme activation outliers in LLMs, improving quantization performance with minimal training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme activation outliers degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment of LLMs.

Method: OSP combines the Muon optimizer, Single-Scale RMSNorm, and learnable embedding projection to prevent outlier formation during pre-training.

Result: A 1.4B-parameter OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score under 4-bit quantization (vs. 26.5 for Adam-trained models) with near-zero excess kurtosis.

Conclusion: Outliers in LLMs are not inherent but result from training strategies; OSP enables more efficient deployment by preventing them.

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically
degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.
While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized
causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe
Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier
formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key
innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while
maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing
channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,
redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We
validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is
the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive
4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10
benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%
training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis
(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally
altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not
inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way
for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints
are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/Outlier-Safe-Pre-Training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Symbolic regression aims to learn interpretable functions with small prediction errors by searching spaces of small expressions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to achieve interpretable functions with small prediction errors, which standard regression methods fail to address due to their reliance on basis function expansions.

Method: Systematic search in spaces of small symbolic expressions, leveraging their decomposable structure.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in accuracy, robustness, and recovering true underlying expressions on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Systematic search of small expressions is more effective for symbolic regression than traditional methods.

Abstract: In a regression task, a function is learned from labeled data to predict the
labels at new data points. The goal is to achieve small prediction errors. In
symbolic regression, the goal is more ambitious, namely, to learn an
interpretable function that makes small prediction errors. This additional goal
largely rules out the standard approach used in regression, that is, reducing
the learning problem to learning parameters of an expansion of basis functions
by optimization. Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good
solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast
search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even
explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious
structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is,
expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that
systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are
more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by
state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods. In particular, systematic search
outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in terms of its ability to
recover the true underlying symbolic expressions on established benchmark data
sets.

TL;DR: CAP introduces a variational framework using von Mises-Fisher distributions for better uncertainty quantification in deep neural networks, improving calibration and interpretability with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing variational inference methods use isotropic Gaussian approximations, which poorly match neural networks' geometry, leading to suboptimal uncertainty quantification.

Method: CAP models weight uncertainties on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions, linking concentration parameters to activation noise variance via a closed-form KL divergence regularizer.

Result: CAP reduces Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x on CIFAR-10 and provides interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles.

Conclusion: CAP offers a theoretically grounded, practical solution for uncertainty quantification in deep learning with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet
existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian
approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent
geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted
Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties
directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building
on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical
weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework
connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural
networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF
concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to
learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence
regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model
calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing
interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal
computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures,
offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty
quantification in deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSA is a game-theoretic method to quantify neural unit contributions in large models, revealing insights like computation hubs and language-specific experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like SHAP fail to quantify neural unit contributions in high-dimensional outputs, creating a need for MSA.

Method: MSA uses systematic lesioning of unit combinations to produce Shapley Modes, matching the model's output dimensionality.

Result: MSA identifies computation hubs, language-specific experts in LLMs, and an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.

Conclusion: MSA is a powerful tool for interpreting, editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

Abstract: Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of
parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these
high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP,
attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural
units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that
gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic
game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units,
MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact
dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from
multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation
concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts
inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.
Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting,
editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cross-regularization automates regularization tuning by using validation gradients during training, balancing feature learning and complexity control, and converges to cross-validation optima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning of regularization parameters is time-consuming and suboptimal. Cross-regularization aims to automate this process efficiently.

Method: Splits parameter optimization: training data guides feature learning, while validation data shapes regularization. Implemented via noise injection in neural networks.

Result: Reveals high noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization. Integrates with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration, and growing datasets efficiently.

Conclusion: Cross-regularization provides a simple, gradient-based solution for automated regularization, improving model performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity
against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly
adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during
training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides
feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging
provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection
in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high
noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges
organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework
integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and
growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple
gradient-based approach.

*Shuncheng He,Hongchang Zhang,Jianzhun Shao,Yuhang Jiang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the out-of-distribution problem in offline RL by analyzing the impact of batch data on performance and proposing UDG for unsupervised data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL suffers from out-of-distribution issues, and existing methods focus on in-distribution sampling. This work explores the role of batch data in performance gaps.

Method: The study theoretically links batch data distribution to offline RL performance and introduces UDG for unsupervised data generation in task-agnostic settings.

Result: UDG outperforms supervised data generation in solving unknown tasks, minimizing worst-case regret.

Conclusion: Theoretical and empirical results highlight the importance of batch data quality and demonstrate UDG's effectiveness in offline RL.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL
researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL.
Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in
in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays
attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a
bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms
theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We
draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the
state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the
distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap
between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy.
Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies
trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the
performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised
Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline
training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG
can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how fine-tuning language models on insecure data leads to 'emergent misalignment,' showing this behavior across diverse conditions and investigating mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models generalize behaviors from training to deployment, particularly focusing on AI safety and emergent misalignment.

Method: Extends prior work by testing emergent misalignment in various scenarios (reinforcement learning, synthetic datasets, models without safety training) and uses 'model diffing' with sparse autoencoders to analyze internal representations.

Result: Identifies 'misaligned persona' features in activation space, including a toxic persona feature that predicts misalignment. Shows that fine-tuning on benign samples can restore alignment.

Conclusion: Emergent misalignment is a widespread issue, but targeted mitigation strategies can effectively address it.

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to
a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley
et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes
"emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses
to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment
across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning
models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety
training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment,
we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare
internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach
reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a
toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and
can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior.
Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that
fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples
efficiently restores alignment.

TL;DR: CAAT-Net reduces tensor-parallel communication in LLMs by 50% without significant accuracy loss, improving training and inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tensor-parallelism in LLMs requires high communication bandwidth for activation synchronization, which is inefficient.

Method: Proposes CAAT-Net, a communication-aware architecture, with minor adjustments to avoid full activation synchronization.

Result: Achieves 50% reduction in tensor-parallel communication for 1B and 7B parameter models, maintaining pretraining accuracy.

Conclusion: CAAT-Net effectively reduces communication demands, enhancing efficiency in both training and inference for LLMs.

Abstract: Training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) with
tensor-parallelism requires substantial communication to synchronize
activations. Our findings suggest that with a few minor adjustments to current
practices, LLMs can be trained without fully synchronizing activations,
reducing bandwidth demands. We name this "Communication-Aware Architecture for
Tensor-parallelism" (CAAT-Net). We train 1B and 7B parameter CAAT-Net models,
with a 50% reduction in tensor-parallel communication and no significant drop
in pretraining accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how CAAT-Net accelerates
both training and inference workloads.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OFTv2 improves upon OFT by reducing computational costs and memory usage while maintaining performance, enabling efficient finetuning of quantized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high runtime and memory demands of OFT limit its practical deployment, necessitating a more efficient approach.

Method: OFTv2 replaces OFT's weight-centric implementation with an input-centric one using matrix-vector multiplications and introduces the Cayley-Neumann parameterization for efficient orthogonal parameterization.

Result: OFTv2 achieves up to 10x faster training, 3x lower GPU memory usage, and outperforms QLoRA in stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

Conclusion: OFTv2 is a highly efficient and practical solution for finetuning, including quantized models, without performance loss.

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

### [101] [Model Guidance via Robust Feature Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19680)
*Mihnea Ghitu,Matthew Wicker,Vihari Piratla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method simplifies the objective for mitigating shortcut learning by optimizing explanation robustness, reducing test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcut learning, where models rely on irrelevant features, can cause real-world harms. Current methods using feature salience annotations are unreliable.

Method: Proposes a simplified objective combining explanation robustness and shortcut mitigation, theoretically justified and tested across experiments.

Result: Achieves 20% fewer test-time misclassifications, extends to NLP tasks, and provides insights like annotation quality over quantity.

Conclusion: The approach effectively mitigates shortcut learning, outperforming existing methods, with practical insights and open-source code.

Abstract: Controlling the patterns a model learns is essential to preventing reliance
on irrelevant or misleading features. Such reliance on irrelevant features,
often called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including
medical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to
real-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided
by humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant.
These annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of
feature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training.
Unfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are
unreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize. In this work, we
propose a simplified objective that simultaneously optimizes for explanation
robustness and mitigation of shortcut learning. Unlike prior objectives with
similar aims, we demonstrate theoretically why our approach ought to be more
effective. Across a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that our
approach consistently reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We also extend prior experimental settings to include
natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we conduct novel ablations
that yield practical insights, including the relative importance of annotation
quality over quantity. Code for our method and experiments is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using lightweight generators based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce memory usage in memory-based continual learning, improving accuracy without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize memory footprint while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, avoiding the need to store all past data.

Method: Uses SVD-based lightweight generators to enhance methods like A-GEM and Experience Replay, requiring minimal memory and no training time.

Result: Significant increase in average accuracy compared to original methods, with minimal memory usage.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces memory footprint in memory-based continual learning, showing great potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting can be trivially alleviated by keeping all data from
previous tasks in memory. Therefore, minimizing the memory footprint while
maximizing the amount of relevant information is crucial to the challenge of
continual learning. This paper aims to decrease required memory for
memory-based continuous learning algorithms. We explore the options of
extracting a minimal amount of information, while maximally alleviating
forgetting. We propose the usage of lightweight generators based on Singular
Value Decomposition to enhance existing continual learning methods, such as
A-GEM and Experience Replay. These generators need a minimal amount of memory
while being maximally effective. They require no training time, just a single
linear-time fitting step, and can capture a distribution effectively from a
small number of data samples. Depending on the dataset and network
architecture, our results show a significant increase in average accuracy
compared to the original methods. Our method shows great potential in
minimizing the memory footprint of memory-based continual learning algorithms.

TL;DR: ReBoot is the first framework enabling fully encrypted, non-interactive training of DNNs using Homomorphic Encryption (HE), achieving accuracy comparable to plaintext training while enhancing privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for deep learning methods that protect sensitive data during computation, especially in privacy-critical applications.

Method: ReBoot introduces an HE-compliant neural network architecture with local error signals, tailored packing, and approximate bootstrapping to minimize computational overhead.

Result: ReBoot achieves accuracy close to plaintext training, improves test accuracy over existing encrypted methods, and reduces training latency significantly.

Conclusion: ReBoot advances encrypted DNN training, offering a practical solution for privacy-preserving machine learning.

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy underscore the need for deep learning
methods capable of processing sensitive information without compromising
confidentiality. Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end
data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely
been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training
has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party
computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial
computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training
under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully
encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme,
ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on
local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and
reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that
leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering
both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate
bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of
arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine
learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and
tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point
plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test
accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83%
over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up
to 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public
repository.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-based method combining reinforcement learning and bigraph matching to optimize resource allocation for restoring critical infrastructure networks after disruptions, outperforming random and optimization-based solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently restoring critical infrastructure networks (CINs) post-disruptions by optimizing crew and resource allocation, ensuring rapid and functional recovery.

Method: A graph-based formulation merges crew/transportation and power grid nodes into a heterogeneous graph. Graph reinforcement learning (GRL) with bigraph matching is used for task assignment, employing two learning techniques: Proximal Policy Optimization and Neuroevolution.

Result: The method shows 3-fold better performance than random policies and outperforms optimization-based solutions in computation time and power restored, demonstrating generalizability and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the combinatorial optimization problem of CIN restoration, offering scalable and efficient solutions for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions,
such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of
restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained.
Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning
problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network
nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation
that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation
nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable
efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with
bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for
assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the
environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning
techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive
functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling
weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation
environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train
the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution
test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the
case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes,
depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and
scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better
performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based
solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power
restored.

*Seyedmorteza Sadat,Tobias Vontobel,Farnood Salehi,Romann M. Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Frequency-Decoupled Guidance (FDG) to improve classifier-free guidance (CFG) in diffusion models by separately scaling low and high-frequency components, enhancing image quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG's mechanisms for improving quality and alignment are not fully understood, and its uniform scaling across frequencies causes issues like oversaturation or degraded quality.

Method: Analyzes CFG in the frequency domain, proposes FDG to decouple and separately scale low and high-frequency guidance.

Result: FDG improves image quality, avoids oversaturation, and preserves diversity, outperforming CFG in FID and recall metrics.

Conclusion: FDG is a plug-and-play alternative to CFG, enhancing sample fidelity and diversity in diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the
underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt
alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by
analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high
frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically,
low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while
high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a
uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to
oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality
at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance
(FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency
components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG
improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high
CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets
and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while
preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG,
establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard
classifier-free guidance.

*Ben Keslaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT is a preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational analysis to extract salient data features, improving training stability and generalization in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The bottleneck in deep learning is input preparation; DRIFT aims to provide minimal, structured, and noise-free data representations.

Method: DRIFT projects images onto low-dimensional spatial vibration mode shapes, reducing input dimensions while retaining essential patterns.

Result: DRIFT achieves competitive accuracy with fewer features (~50 for MNIST, <100 for CIFAR100) and outperforms pixel-based models and PCA in stability and robustness.

Conclusion: DRIFT highlights the importance of physics-driven input curation over architecture engineering for advancing deep learning performance.

Abstract: Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the
data has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right
input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential
patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature
Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational
analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes
of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to
learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by
emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The
result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances
training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are
projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes
of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural
networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on
MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's
superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training
stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably,
DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network
architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and
efficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from
architecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of
physics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.

*Yihong Luo,Shuchen Xue,Tianyang Hu,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Noise Consistency Training (NCT) is introduced to efficiently integrate control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without retraining, achieving high-quality controllable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of adapting one-step generators to new control conditions without costly modifications or retraining.

Method: NCT uses an adapter module and noise consistency loss to align generation behavior with new controls, minimizing distributional distance.

Result: NCT outperforms existing methods in generation quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: NCT is a lightweight, modular, and data-efficient solution for controllable content generation.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study online convex optimization on $\ell_p$-balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$p > 2$. While always sub-linear, the optimal regret exhibits a shift between
the high-dimensional setting ($d > T$), when the dimension $d$ is greater than
the time horizon $T$ and the low-dimensional setting ($d \leq T$). We show that
Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularisation which is
adaptive to the dimension regime is anytime optimal for all dimension regimes.
Motivated by this, we ask whether it is possible to obtain anytime optimality
of FTRL with fixed non-adaptive regularisation. Our main result establishes
that for separable regularisers, adaptivity in the regulariser is necessary,
and that any fixed regulariser will be sub-optimal in one of the two dimension
regimes. Finally, we provide lower bounds which rule out sub-linear regret
bounds for the linear bandit problem in sufficiently high-dimension for all
$\ell_p$-balls with $p \geq 1$.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO, a framework extending Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to handle multiple preference dimensions dynamically, improving flexibility and adaptability in aligning language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods like RLHF are computationally intensive and inflexible, while DPO assumes static preferences. The goal is to enable multi-objective and dynamic alignment.

Method: Proposes a novel framework incorporating multiple preference dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness) and dynamic interpolation via a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Supports listwise feedback and flexible alignment without re-training.

Result: Empirical and theoretical analysis shows the method matches DPO's effectiveness on static objectives while offering greater adaptability for real-world use.

Conclusion: The framework provides a lightweight, stable, and flexible solution for aligning language models with diverse and dynamic human preferences.

Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired
objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision.
Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement
learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often
computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.
  To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was
introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment
of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss.
However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference
distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment
settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted
Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference
dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables
dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our
method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across
varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static
objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world
deployment.

TL;DR: A new adaptive weighting scheme for PINNs improves accuracy by dynamically adjusting loss function weights from points to neighborhoods, reducing relative L2 errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs face challenges in convergence and accuracy due to optimization with finite points.

Method: Proposed an adaptive weighting scheme for loss functions, transitioning from isolated points to continuous neighborhood regions.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate reduced relative L2 errors.

Conclusion: The adaptive weighting scheme enhances PINN performance in solving PDEs.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively employed to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) by ensuring that the outputs and
gradients of deep learning models adhere to the governing equations. However,
constrained by computational limitations, PINNs are typically optimized using a
finite set of points, which poses significant challenges in guaranteeing their
convergence and accuracy. In this study, we proposed a new weighting scheme
that will adaptively change the weights to the loss functions from isolated
points to their continuous neighborhood regions. The empirical results show
that our weighting scheme can reduce the relative $L^2$ errors to a lower

### [111] [Ambiguous Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19810)
*Vanessa Kosoy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'ambiguous online learning,' where learners can predict multiple labels, with correctness defined by at least one correct label and no 'predictably wrong' labels. It explores mistake bounds in this setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The setting is natural for multivalued dynamical systems, recommendation algorithms, and lossless compression, and relates to 'apple tasting.'

Method: Learners produce ambiguous predictions, and correctness is determined by the true hypothesis class.

Result: A trichotomy of mistake bounds is shown: Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)), or N, up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a framework for ambiguous online learning with clear mistake-bound classifications.

Abstract: We propose a new variant of online learning that we call "ambiguous online
learning". In this setting, the learner is allowed to produce multiple
predicted labels. Such an "ambiguous prediction" is considered correct when at
least one of the labels is correct, and none of the labels are "predictably
wrong". The definition of "predictably wrong" comes from a hypothesis class in
which hypotheses are also multi-valued. Thus, a prediction is "predictably
wrong" if it's not allowed by the (unknown) true hypothesis. In particular,
this setting is natural in the context of multivalued dynamical systems,
recommendation algorithms and lossless compression. It is also strongly related
to so-called "apple tasting". We show that in this setting, there is a
trichotomy of mistake bounds: up to logarithmic factors, any hypothesis class
has an optimal mistake bound of either Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)) or N.

### [112] [Curating art exhibitions using machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19813)
*Eurico Covas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI models replicate human art curatorship by learning from past exhibitions, showing promise for future applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if AI can mimic human art curatorship by learning from historical exhibition data.

Method: Developed four machine learning models trained on 25 years of Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibitions.

Result: Models achieved reasonable accuracy in replicating past exhibitions, outperforming random choices.

Conclusion: AI can replicate curatorship with modest models, and more data could improve aesthetic judgment.

Abstract: Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts,
who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of
those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call
art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these
artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or
constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a
total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset
of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions
which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar
curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data
available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four
artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these
various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of
precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key
insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to
construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions
with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature
engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can
make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as
GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use
the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it
should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be
closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art
curators.

### [113] [Scaling Speculative Decoding with Lookahead Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19830)
*Yichao Fu,Rui Ge,Zelei Shao,Zhijie Deng,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lookahead Reasoning improves speculative decoding by adding step-level parallelism, boosting speedup from 1.4x to 2.1x while maintaining answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speculative decoding (SD) faces a ceiling in speedup due to exponential drop in correctness for longer token drafts.

Method: Introduces Lookahead Reasoning, leveraging step-level parallelism: a draft model proposes future steps, the target model expands them in parallel, and a verifier ensures semantic correctness.

Result: Achieves 2.1x speedup (vs. 1.4x for SD) on benchmarks like GSM8K and AIME, with better scaling on GPUs.

Conclusion: Lookahead Reasoning effectively raises the algorithmic ceiling of SD, offering scalable speedup without compromising quality.

Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the
resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)
helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire
$\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This
means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic
ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this
ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of
parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,
and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.
In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future
steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a
verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate
any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the
two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak
speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other
benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x
while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional
GPU throughput. Our code is available at

### [114] [MATE: LLM-Powered Multi-Agent Translation Environment for Accessibility Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19502)
*Aleksandr Algazinov,Matt Laing,Paul Laban*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MATE is a multimodal accessibility MAS that converts data formats based on user needs, aiding individuals with disabilities by ensuring data is in an understandable format. It supports various models and ensures privacy by running locally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAS lack customization for accessibility, creating barriers for users with disabilities. MATE addresses this by providing adaptable, privacy-focused assistance.

Method: MATE uses modality conversions (e.g., image to audio) and supports multiple models, including LLM APIs and custom ML classifiers. It includes ModCon-Task-Identifier for precise task extraction.

Result: MATE outperforms other models in modality conversion tasks and is adaptable across domains like healthcare.

Conclusion: MATE offers a flexible, privacy-aware solution for accessibility, with potential for broad application and integration with institutional technologies.

Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many
technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs.
Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive
assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from
closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently
encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital
environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs
the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for
assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to
an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and
receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description.
MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as
healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The
system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using
custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the
system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of
hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy
and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be
effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital
healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce
ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise
modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that
ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical
models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/AlgazinovAleksandr/Multi-Agent-MATE.

### [115] [Collaborative governance of cyber violence: A two-phase, multi-scenario four-party evolutionary game and SBI1I2R public opinion dissemination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19704)
*Xiaoting Yang,Wei Lv,Ting Yang,Bart Baesens*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage, multi-scenario governance mechanism for cyber violence, combining evolutionary game theory and communication dynamics to analyze and mitigate its impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber violence disrupts public order, but existing studies lack micro-macro integration. This study aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Phase 1: Evolutionary game model with four parties. Phase 2: SBI1I2R model for public opinion, integrating emotional factors. Simulations in Matlab and Netlogo.

Result: Strong government regulation with moderate punishment is most effective. Collaborative intervention between media and government works best.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism, validated by simulations and case study, enhances practical governance of cyber violence.

Abstract: Cyber violence severely disrupts public order in both cyberspace and the real
world. Existing studies have gradually advocated collaborative governance but
rely on macro-level theoretical analyses. This study integrates micro- and
macro-level perspectives to propose a two-stage, multi-scenario governance
mechanism for cyber violence. In the first phase, a multi-scenario evolutionary
game model with four parties involved in cyber violence was developed based on
evolutionary game theory. Matlab simulations show that under strong government
regulation, moderate levels of punishment implemented by the government against
the online media that adopt misguidance strategies can achieve the most
desirable stable state. In the second phase, the role of bystanders was
introduced by integrating communication dynamics theory, and emotional factors
were considered alongside game strategies. This led to the development of a new
SBI1I2R model for public opinion dissemination in cyber violence. Netlogo
simulations found that increasing the "correct guidance" strategy by the online
media reduces the influence of cyber violence supporters and the time it takes
for their nodes to drop to zero, but does not significantly shorten the time
for the peak to occur. Comparatively, collaborative intervention between the
online media and the government was most effective in curbing public opinion,
followed by the government's independent "strong regulation." Relying solely on
the online media's "correct guidance" produced the weakest effect. Finally,
this mechanism was applied to a case study, and a multi-stage, multi-scenario
analysis based on life cycle theory enhanced its practical applicability.

### [116] [On the efficacy of old features for the detection of new bots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19635)
*Rocco De Nicola,Marinella Petrocchi,Manuel Pratelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores bot detection on Twitter, comparing four feature sets to identify evolved bots using general-purpose classifiers and cost-effective features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of malicious bots spreading spam and influencing public opinion necessitates effective detection methods.

Method: The study compares four feature sets, including Botometer scores, account profiles, timelines, and Twitter client data, tested on six Twitter datasets.

Result: Findings suggest general-purpose classifiers and inexpensive features can effectively detect evolved bots.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of simple, cost-effective features for bot detection, offering practical solutions for online platforms.

Abstract: For more than a decade now, academicians and online platform administrators
have been studying solutions to the problem of bot detection. Bots are computer
algorithms whose use is far from being benign: malicious bots are purposely
created to distribute spam, sponsor public characters and, ultimately, induce a
bias within the public opinion. To fight the bot invasion on our online
ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on
(supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account
features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the
raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study,
using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art
feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular
bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account
to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline;
and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets. The
results of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter
accounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and
cheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.
