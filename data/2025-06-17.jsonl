Existing methods tend to be based on heuristic design and\nconsequently lack theoretical rigor and ambiguous credit assignment among\nagents. To address these limitations, we model and solve NAHT through the lens\nof cooperative game theory. More specifically, we first model an open\nmulti-agent system, characterized by its value, as an instance situated in a\nspace of cooperative games, generated by a set of basis games. We then extend\nthis space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios,\nthereby characterizing NAHT. Exploiting the justifiable assumption that basis\ngame values correspond to a sequence of n-step returns with different horizons,\nwe represent the state values for NAHT in a form similar to $\\lambda$-returns.\nFurthermore, we derive Shapley values to allocate state values to the\ncontrolled agents, as credits for their contributions to the ad hoc team.\nDifferent from the conventional approach to shaping Shapley values in an\nexplicit form, we shape Shapley values by fulfilling the three axioms uniquely\ndescribing them, well defined on the extended game space describing NAHT. To\nestimate Shapley values in dynamic scenarios, we propose a TD($\\lambda$)-like\nalgorithm. The resulting reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is referred to\nas Shapley Machine. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the\nconcepts from cooperative game theory are directly related to RL concepts. In\nexperiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Shapley Machine and verify\nreasonableness of our theory."}

To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a\nnovel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states.\nPromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label\nand boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and\nfine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns.\nExperiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity\nsegmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in\ntransfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and\nevolving time series dynamics."}

To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective\nAlignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by\nprioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,\ncharacteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient\nreasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented\nmethod to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.\nAdditionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms\nand outline promising research directions."}

However, in the context of limited and noisy data,\naccurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is\na challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.\nCurrent methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for\nreal-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the\nDelayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,\nby developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)\ntransformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state\n(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From\ndynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than\nindividual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such\nnonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a\nsingle shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical\nstates from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs\ndistinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently\npredicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical\nfoundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of\nTransformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in\nforecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,\nwhich, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph\nto the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured\nby the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening\nframeworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting\nmatrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a\ncoarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of\nthese two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on\nthe lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the\ncoarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this\npaper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not\nnecessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy\nof ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different\nproperties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form\ndescription or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed\nlifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the\nreduction matrix.

In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are\nwell suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and\ndirected acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of\nmulti-dimensionality to linear RNNs.

This enables parallelization in analogy\nto parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential\nlinear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this\nscheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,\nand padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding\nactivation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:\na directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode\n(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce\narrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains\nlong-distance directional information.

Particularly in rural areas,\nwhere public transport is inconvenient to use, private cars are a common choice\nfor commuting and most commuters travel alone in their cars. Consolidation of\nsome of these trips has the potential to decrease CO2 emissions and could be\nachieved, e.g., by offering ridesharing (commuters with similar\norigin-destination pairs share a car) or ridepooling (commuters are picked up\nby shuttle services). In this study, we present a framework to assess the\npotential of introducing new mobility modes like ridesharing and ridepooling\nfor commuting towards several locations in close vicinity to each other.\n  We test our framework on the case of student mobility to the University of\nW\\\"urzburg, a university with several campus locations and a big and rather\nrural catchment area, where existing public transport options are inconvenient\nand many students commute by car. We combine data on student home addresses and\ncampus visitation times to create demand scenarios. In our case study, we\ncompare the mobility modes of ridesharing and ridepooling to the base case,\nwhere students travel by car on their own. We find that ridesharing has the\npotential to greatly reduce emissions, depending on the percentage of students\nwilling to use the service and their willingness to walk to the departure\nlocation. The benefit of ridepooling is less clear, materializing only if the\nshuttle vehicles are more energy efficient than the student cars."}

However, solving the associated non-convex\n  optimization problems is computationally expensive, which limits the\n  scalability of these methods to large graphs. In this work, we\n  present Unbalanced Learning of Optimal Transport (ULOT), a deep\n  learning method that predicts optimal transport plans between two\n  graphs. Our method is trained by minimizing the fused unbalanced\n  Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) loss. We propose a novel neural\n  architecture with cross-attention that is conditioned on the FUGW\n  tradeoff hyperparameters. We evaluate ULOT on synthetic stochastic\n  block model (SBM) graphs and on real cortical surface data obtained\n  from fMRI. ULOT predicts transport plans with competitive loss up to\n  two orders of magnitude faster than classical solvers. Furthermore,\n  the predicted plan can be used as a warm start for classical solvers\n  to accelerate their convergence.

Such conversation is a new capability that\ntraditional `inspective' interpretability methods (opening the black-box) do\nnot use. Having a language model that aims to teach and explain--beyond just\nknowing how to talk--is similar to a teacher whose goal is to teach well,\nunderstanding that their success will be measured by the student's\ncomprehension. While agentic interpretability may trade off completeness for\ninteractivity, making it less suitable for high-stakes safety situations with\npotentially deceptive models, it leverages a cooperative model to discover\npotentially superhuman concepts that can improve humans' mental model of\nmachines. Agentic interpretability introduces challenges, particularly in\nevaluation, due to what we call `human-entangled-in-the-loop' nature (humans\nresponses are integral part of the algorithm), making the design and evaluation\ndifficult. We discuss possible solutions and proxy goals. As LLMs approach\nhuman parity in many tasks, agentic interpretability's promise is to help\nhumans learn the potentially superhuman concepts of the LLMs, rather than see\nus fall increasingly far from understanding them."}

Although\nprior studies have attempted to capture interactive driving behaviors, most\napproaches relied solely on game-theoretic formulations and did not leverage\nnaturalistic driving datasets. In this study, we learn human-like interactive\ndriving policies at unsignalized intersections using Deep Fictitious Play.\nSpecifically, we first model vehicle interactions as a Differential Game, which\nis then reformulated as a Potential Differential Game. The weights in the cost\nfunction are learned from the dataset and capture diverse driving styles. We\nalso demonstrate that our framework provides a theoretical guarantee of\nconvergence to a Nash equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst study to train interactive driving policies using Deep Fictitious Play.\nWe validate the effectiveness of our Deep Fictitious Play-Based Potential\nDifferential Game (DFP-PDG) framework using the INTERACTION dataset. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves satisfactory\nperformance in learning human-like driving policies. The learned individual\nweights effectively capture variations in driver aggressiveness and\npreferences.

Traditional data-driven models lack real-world physical\nconstraints, leading to forecasts that disobey vessel motion dynamics, such as\nin scenarios with limited or noisy data where sudden course changes or speed\nvariations occur due to external factors. To address this limitation, we\npropose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach for trajectory\nprediction that integrates a streamlined kinematic model for vessel motion into\nthe neural network training process via a first- and second-order, finite\ndifference physics-based loss function. This loss function, discretized using\nthe first-order forward Euler method, Heun's second-order approximation, and\nrefined with a midpoint approximation based on Taylor series expansion,\nenforces fidelity to fundamental physical principles by penalizing deviations\nfrom expected kinematic behavior. We evaluated PINN using real-world AIS\ndatasets that cover diverse maritime conditions and compared it with\nstate-of-the-art models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method\nreduces average displacement errors by up to 32% across models and datasets\nwhile maintaining physical consistency.

This study\nemploys several machine learning techniques and causal analysis to predict and\nelucidate the impacts of these factors on academic performance. We constructed\na hypothetical causal graph and collected data from 1,050 student profiles.\nFollowing meticulous data cleaning and visualization, we analyze linear\nrelationships through correlation and variable plots, and perform causal\nanalysis on the hypothetical graph. Regression and classification models are\napplied for prediction, and unsupervised causality analysis using PC, GES,\nICA-LiNGAM, and GRASP algorithms is conducted. Our regression analysis shows\nthat Ridge Regression achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.12 and a Mean\nSquared Error (MSE) of 0.024, indicating robustness, while classification\nmodels like Random Forest achieve nearly perfect F1-scores. The causal analysis\nshows significant direct and indirect effects of factors such as class\nattendance, study hours, and group study on CGPA. These insights are validated\nthrough unsupervised causality analysis. By integrating the best regression\nmodel into a web application, we are developing a practical tool for students\nand educators to enhance academic outcomes based on empirical evidence."}

This synergy has sparked a\ntechnological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial\nintelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining\nhuman-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous\nintelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource\nconsumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To\naddress these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary\nframework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a\nparticular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud\nframework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers,\nand cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model\ninference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to\na series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling\neffective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource\nconstraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based\nintelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging\ncommunication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI\nmodels across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses\nthe capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced\nintelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI\nservices, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and\ncommunication systems."}

Given a new dataset, they need to\ndetermine the most suitable deep learning (DL) pipeline, consisting of the\npretrained model and the hyperparameters for finetuning to it. Moreover, as\nmodels grow in scale, the increasing reliance on real-world data poses a\nbottleneck for training and requires leveraging data more effectively.\nAddressing the first challenge often involves manual model selection and\nhyperparameter tuning. At the same time, as models grow larger and more and\nmore of the available human-generated data is being used for training, data\naugmentation and synthetic data become critical elements. Automated machine\nlearning offers a path to address these challenges but is traditionally\ndesigned for tabular data and classical ML methods. This dissertation adopts\nmeta-learning to extend automated machine learning to the deep learning domain.\nWe propose empirical approaches to automate DL pipeline selection for Computer\nVision tasks using prior task knowledge to learn surrogate models for pipeline\nranking. Extending these methods to the language domain, we learn to finetune\nlarge language models. As a result, we show that our approach can outperform\nfinetuning foundation models. Additionally, we meta-learn data augmentation and\nsynthetic data to enhance performance in up-stream and down-stream tasks. We\nempirically show the underestimated importance of data augmentation when using\nSelf-Supervised Learning and meta-learn advanced data augmentation strategies.\nLeveraging synthetic data, we also propose to meta-learn neural synthetic data\ngenerators as proxies for Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments.\nAdditionally, we learn a multiple-environment world model in an in-context\nlearning fashion by purely using synthetic, randomly sampled data."}

Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different quantization\ntechniques applied to the parameters and activations in the S4D architecture.\nTo address the observed performance drop after Post-training Quantization\n(PTQ), we apply Quantization-aware Training (QAT), significantly improving\nperformance from 40% (PTQ) to 96% on the sequential MNIST benchmark at 8-bit\nprecision. We further demonstrate the potential of QAT in enabling sub-8-bit\nprecisions and evaluate different parameterization schemes for QAT stability.\nAdditionally, we propose a heterogeneous quantization strategy that assigns\ndifferent precision levels to model components, reducing the overall memory\nfootprint by a factor of 6x without sacrificing performance. Our results\nprovide actionable insights for deploying quantized SSMs in\nresource-constrained environments."}

We review existing literature and identify three\nsignificant shortcoming: (i) Over-reliance on prepackaged moral scenarios with\nexplicitly highlighted moral features; (ii) Focus on verdict prediction rather\nthan moral reasoning; and (iii) Inadequate testing of models' (in)ability to\nrecognize when additional information is needed. Grounded in philosophical\nresearch on moral skill, we then introduce a novel method for assessing moral\ncompetence in LLMs. Our approach moves beyond simple verdict comparisons to\nevaluate five dimensions of moral competence: identifying morally relevant\nfeatures, weighting their importance, assigning moral reasons to these\nfeatures, synthesizing coherent moral judgments, and recognizing information\ngaps. We conduct two experiments comparing six leading LLMs against non-expert\nhumans and professional philosophers. In our first experiment using ethical\nvignettes standard to existing work, LLMs generally outperformed non-expert\nhumans across multiple dimensions of moral reasoning. However, our second\nexperiment, featuring novel scenarios designed to test moral sensitivity by\nembedding relevant features among irrelevant details, revealed a striking\nreversal: several LLMs performed significantly worse than humans. Our findings\nsuggest that current evaluations may substantially overestimate LLMs' moral\nreasoning capabilities by eliminating the task of discerning moral relevance\nfrom noisy information, which we take to be a prerequisite for genuine moral\nskill. This work provides a more nuanced framework for assessing AI moral\ncompetence and highlights important directions for improving moral competence\nin advanced AI systems."}

Semivalues have been\nproposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as\ndetermining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or\nfiltering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on\nthe specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar\nscore. While it is broadly agreed that this utility function arises from a\ncomposition of a learning algorithm and a performance metric, its actual\ninstantiation involves numerous subtle modeling choices. We argue that this\nunderspecification leads to varying degrees of arbitrariness in semivalue-based\nvaluations. Small, but arguably reasonable changes to the utility function can\ninduce substantial shifts in valuations across datapoints. Moreover, these\nvaluation methodologies are also often gameable: low-cost adversarial\nstrategies exist to exploit this ambiguity and systematically redistribute\nvalue among datapoints.

Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing\ndiffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to\nfundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose\nBlock-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by\ncaching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation\nacceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block\nlevel, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly\nacross timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose\nthe Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps\nby maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped\nfeatures. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant\nerror surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly\nwithin Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop\nthe Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the\nupstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a\ntraining-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based\nDiffusion Policy and vision-language-action models.

Concretely, we develop\ncontext-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance\nmatrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the\ntarget task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its\ncorresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is\ncompacted into the principal components.

We further develop CorDA++ by\nderiving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal\ncomponents, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank\nallocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each\nlayer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank\nallocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a\nsignificant margin.

Their construction involves aggregating criteria\nevaluations, a common practice in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). In\nMCDA, various methods have been proposed to address key aspects of multiple\ncriteria evaluations, such as the measurement scales of the criteria, the\ndegree of acceptable compensation between them, and their potential\ninteractions. However, beyond producing a final score or classification, it is\nessential to ensure the explainability and interpretability of results as well\nas the procedure's transparency. This paper proposes a method for constructing\nexplainable and interpretable composite indicators using \"if..., then...\"\ndecision rules. We consider the explainability and interpretability of\ncomposite indicators in four scenarios: (i) decision rules explain numerical\nscores obtained from an aggregation of numerical codes corresponding to ordinal\nqualifiers; (ii) an obscure numerical composite indicator classifies units into\nquantiles; (iii) given preference information provided by a Decision Maker in\nthe form of classifications of some reference units, a composite indicator is\nconstructed using decision rules; (iv) the classification of a set of units\nresults from the application of an MCDA method and is explained by decision\nrules. To induce the rules from scored or classified units, we apply the\nDominance-based Rough Set Approach. The resulting decision rules relate the\nclass assignment or unit's score to threshold conditions on values of selected\nindicators in an intelligible way, clarifying the underlying rationale.\nMoreover, they serve to recommend composite indicator assessment for new units\nof interest."}

To alleviate the concerns, we pioneer the study of dynamic graph\ncondensation (DGC), which aims to substantially reduce the scale of dynamic\ngraphs for data-efficient DGNN training.

In this paper, we propose\ncontext-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that\ninitializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop\ncontext-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance\nmatrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the\ntarget task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its\ncorresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is\ncompacted into the principal components.

We further develop CorDA++ by\nderiving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal\ncomponents, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank\nallocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each\nlayer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank\nallocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a\nsignificant margin.

Expert-designed methods such as ALiBi and RoPE, mitigate this\nlimitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities,\nunderscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this\nwork, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding\nframework that represents each $n$-dimensional position index as a symbolic\nsequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their\nembeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we\nintroduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns\nembedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a\nknowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position\nembeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing\nextrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context\nquestion answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only\nsurpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and\naccuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables\nseamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual\narchitectural redesign.

Paradoxically though, in many scenarios the\nnaive addition of macro-actions does not lead to better exploration, but rather\nthe opposite. It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful\nmacros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively\nenvironment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different\nperspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between\nreducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size\nof the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action\nas independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and\nmaking typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we\npropose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between\nactions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by\nreducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving\nexploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned\njointly with learning the desired policy. We empirically validate our strategy\nlooking at macro-actions in Atari games, and the StreetFighter II environment.\nOur results show significant improvements over the Rainbow-DQN baseline in all\nenvironments. Additionally, we show that the macro-action similarity is\ntransferable to related environments.

Estimating this quantity is challenging, since unsafe\nresponses are exceedingly rare in well-aligned LLMs, potentially occurring only\nonce in thousands of generations. As a result, directly estimating\ntime-to-unsafe-sampling would require collecting training data with a\nprohibitively large number of generations per prompt. However, with realistic\nsampling budgets, we often cannot generate enough responses to observe an\nunsafe outcome for every prompt, leaving the time-to-unsafe-sampling unobserved\nin many cases, making the estimation and evaluation tasks particularly\nchallenging.

In\ncontrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which\nare harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory\napproaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical\nperformance due to its simplicity and stability.

However,\nas MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces\nnew safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are\nnot controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party\nMCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic\nincentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In\nthis position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay\nclose attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop\nnew techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our\nposition, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \\framework, a\ncontrolled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2)\nWe then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks\nin MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial.\n(3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered\nagent systems.

Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic\nspatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including\nspatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints\nof spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial\ncorrelation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a\nphysics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed\nSpatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to\nintegrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating\nconstraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two\nspatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the\nlikelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial\ninteractions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the\nlearned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon\nin transformer attention matrices. The underlying law of human activity can be\nexplicitly modeled by the proposed adaptive gravity model. Moreover, a parallel\nspatiotemporal graph convolution transformer structure is proposed for\nachieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic\nexperiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the\nquantitative and qualitative superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks.

Previous approaches\ncan be grouped into two primary \"meta-learner\" paradigms that impose distinct\ninductive biases. Indirect meta-learners first fit and regularize separate\npotential outcome (PO) models and then estimate CATE by taking their\ndifference, whereas direct meta-learners construct and directly regularize\nestimators for the CATE function itself. Neither approach consistently\noutperforms the other across all scenarios: indirect learners perform well when\nthe PO functions are simple, while direct learners outperform when the CATE is\nsimpler than individual PO functions. In this paper, we introduce the Hybrid\nLearner (H-learner), a novel regularization strategy that interpolates between\nthe direct and indirect regularizations depending on the dataset at hand. The\nH-learner achieves this by learning intermediate functions whose difference\nclosely approximates the CATE without necessarily requiring accurate individual\napproximations of the POs themselves. We demonstrate empirically that\nintentionally allowing suboptimal fits to the POs improves the bias-variance\ntradeoff in estimating CATE.

Paradoxically though, in many scenarios the\nnaive addition of macro-actions does not lead to better exploration, but rather\nthe opposite. It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful\nmacros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively\nenvironment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different\nperspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between\nreducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size\nof the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action\nas independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and\nmaking typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we\npropose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between\nactions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by\nreducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving\nexploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned\njointly with learning the desired policy. We empirically validate our strategy\nlooking at macro-actions in Atari games, and the StreetFighter II environment.\nOur results show significant improvements over the Rainbow-DQN baseline in all\nenvironments. Additionally, we show that the macro-action similarity is\ntransferable to related environments. We believe this work is a small but\nimportant step towards understanding how the similarity-imposed geometry on the\naction space can be exploited to improve credit assignment and exploration,\ntherefore making learning more effective."}

In\ncontrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which\nare harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory\napproaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical\nperformance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires\napproximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high\noff-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of\nabsolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning\nOptimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing\nthe need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards\nusing a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a\nstraightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary\nmodels and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on\nthe policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice.

However, the current\nneural network-based paradigm, while effective, is heavily constrained by\ninherent limitations, primarily a lack of structural organization and a\nprogression of learning that displays undesirable properties. As AI research\nprogresses without a unifying framework, it either tries to patch weaknesses\nheuristically or draws loosely from biological mechanisms without strong\ntheoretical foundations. Meanwhile, the recent paradigm shift in evolutionary\nunderstanding -- driven primarily by evolutionary developmental biology (EDB)\n-- has been largely overlooked in AI literature, despite a striking analogy\nbetween the Modern Synthesis and contemporary machine learning, evident in\ntheir shared assumptions, approaches, and limitations upon careful analysis.\nConsequently, the principles of adaptation from EDB that reshaped our\nunderstanding of the evolutionary process can also form the foundation of a\nunifying conceptual framework for the next design philosophy in AI, going\nbeyond mere inspiration and grounded firmly in biology's first principles. This\narticle provides a detailed overview of the analogy between the Modern\nSynthesis and modern machine learning, and outlines the core principles of a\nnew AI design paradigm based on insights from EDB. To exemplify our analysis,\nwe also present two learning system designs grounded in specific developmental\nprinciples -- regulatory connections, somatic variation and selection, and weak\nlinkage -- that resolve multiple major limitations of contemporary machine\nlearning in an organic manner, while also providing deeper insights into the\nrole of these mechanisms in biological evolution."}

We propose a general-purpose framework for constraint-aware\nrefinement that leverages denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs). Starting\nfrom a coarse prediction, our method iteratively refines it through a\ndeterministic diffusion trajectory guided by a learned prior and augmented by\nconstraint gradient corrections. The approach accommodates a wide class of\nnon-convex and nonlinear equality constraints and can be applied post hoc to\nany base model.

Building on the\nSemantic Manifold framework, which organizes belief content into functional\nsectors and stratifies them across hierarchical levels of abstraction, we\nintroduce a system of sectoral coupling constants that characterize how one\ncognitive sector influences another within a fixed level of abstraction. The\ncomplete set of these constants forms an agent-specific coupling profile that\ngoverns internal information flow, shaping the agent's overall processing\ntendencies and cognitive style. We provide a detailed taxonomy of these\nintra-level coupling roles, covering domains such as perceptual integration,\nmemory access and formation, planning, meta-cognition, execution control, and\naffective modulation. We also explore how these coupling profiles generate\nfeedback loops, systemic dynamics, and emergent signatures of cognitive\nbehavior.

While these\nmulti-step reasoning capabilities represent a major milestone in language model\nperformance, they also introduce new safety risks. In this work, we present the\nfirst systematic study to revisit the problem of machine unlearning in the\ncontext of LRMs. Machine unlearning refers to the process of removing the\ninfluence of sensitive, harmful, or undesired data or knowledge from a trained\nmodel without full retraining. We show that conventional unlearning algorithms,\noriginally designed for non-reasoning models, are inadequate for LRMs. In\nparticular, even when final answers are successfully erased, sensitive\ninformation often persists within the intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., CoT\ntrajectories. To address this challenge, we extend conventional unlearning and\npropose Reasoning-aware Representation Misdirection for Unlearning ($R^2MU$), a\nnovel method that effectively suppresses sensitive reasoning traces and\nprevents the generation of associated final answers, while preserving the\nmodel's reasoning ability.

However, existing approaches\noften fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can\nstruggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning\ncapabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's\nexploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence.

Unlike\nconventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage,\nbeginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy\nOptimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning\ncapacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges\nidentified during RL: (1) \\textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks\nwhere the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which\nwe tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself;\nand (2) \\textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting\nexpert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This\nstrategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement\nforms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B\nparameters).

This paper argues that such unimodal explanations systematically\nmisrepresent and fail to capture the cross-modal influence that drives\nmultimodal model decisions, and the community should stop relying on them for\ninterpreting multimodal models. To support our position, we outline key\nprinciples for multimodal explanations grounded in modality: Granger-style\nmodality influence (controlled ablations to quantify how removing one modality\nchanges the explanation for another), Synergistic faithfulness (explanations\ncapture the model's predictive power when modalities are combined), and Unified\nstability (explanations remain consistent under small, cross-modal\nperturbations).
