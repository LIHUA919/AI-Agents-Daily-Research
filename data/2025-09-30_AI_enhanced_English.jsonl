We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of\nreasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.\nHowever, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout\ndiversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first\ndelve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical\ninsights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps\nof safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe\ncontinuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe\ntrajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened\nPreference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning\nby substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs\nfor preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and\nadversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall\nsafety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and\nRL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while\npreserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks.
