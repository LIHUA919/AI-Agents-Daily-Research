### [1] [Learning-Based Planning for Improving Science Return of Earth Observation Satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07997)
*Abigail Breitfeld,Alberto Candela,Juan Delfa,Akseli Kangaslahti,Itai Zilberstein,Steve Chien,David Wettergreen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Learning-based dynamic targeting for Earth observation satellites using reinforcement and imitation learning outperforms traditional heuristic methods by 10-13.7% in data collection efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observing satellites have limitations in orbital flexibility, sensor field of view, and resource allocation. They need to optimize data collection by focusing on the most informative measurements through intelligent targeting.

Method: Two learning-based approaches: reinforcement learning and imitation learning, building on a dynamic programming solution to plan sampling location sequences. Both methods are trained with relatively small datasets.

Result: Imitation learning performs 10.0% better than the best heuristic method, while reinforcement learning performs 13.7% better on average. Both methods show effective training with small data amounts.

Conclusion: Learning-based approaches significantly improve dynamic targeting performance for satellite data collection compared to conventional heuristic methods, demonstrating the value of AI techniques in space observation optimization.

Abstract: Earth observing satellites are powerful tools for collecting scientific
information about our planet, however they have limitations: they cannot easily
deviate from their orbital trajectories, their sensors have a limited field of
view, and pointing and operating these sensors can take a large amount of the
spacecraft's resources. It is important for these satellites to optimize the
data they collect and include only the most important or informative
measurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite
resources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently
reconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that
dynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered
versus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different
learning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and
imitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic
programming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our
approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing
the benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning
performs on average 10.0\% better than the best heuristic method, while
reinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\% better. We also show that
both learning methods can be trained effectively with relatively small amounts
of data.

### [2] [EnvX: Agentize Everything with Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08088)
*Linyao Chen,Zimian Peng,Yingxuan Yang,Yikun Wang,Wenzheng Tom Tang,Hiroki H. Kobayashi,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EnvX is a framework that transforms GitHub repositories into intelligent AI agents using a three-phase process, enabling natural language interaction and inter-agent collaboration to automate software reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual software reuse from open-source repositories is time-consuming, error-prone, and disconnected, creating significant barriers for developers who need to navigate documentation, understand APIs, and write integration code.

Method: EnvX uses Agentic AI to agentize repositories through: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, (2) human-aligned agentic automation for autonomous task performance, and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol for multi-agent collaboration, combining LLMs with structured tool integration.

Result: On the GitTaskBench benchmark with 18 repositories across various domains, EnvX achieved 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming existing frameworks and demonstrating effective multi-repository collaboration.

Conclusion: EnvX represents a paradigm shift from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent, interactive agents, significantly improving accessibility and collaboration in the open-source ecosystem.

Abstract: The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast
collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains
manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation,
understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to
efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that
leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into
intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and
inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories
as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a
three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up
the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned
agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform
real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple
agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with
structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the
entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository
functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18
repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,
document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves
a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming
existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable
multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift
from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent,
interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within
the open-source ecosystem.

### [3] [Trust Semantics Distillation for Collaborator Selection via Memory-Augmented Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08151)
*Botao Zhu,Jeslyn Wang,Dusit Niyato,Xianbin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes 2TSD model using LAM-driven teacher-student architecture for efficient trust evaluation in collaborative computing tasks


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Independent trust evaluation by each task owner causes significant overhead from frequent data exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic changes

Method: Teacher agent on server collects trust data and extracts task-specific trust semantics, transfers to student agents for rapid collaborator selection

Result: Reduces evaluation time, decreases device resource consumption, and improves selection accuracy

Conclusion: 2TSD model effectively overcomes trust evaluation challenges in collaborative computing through semantics distillation

Abstract: Accurate trustworthiness evaluation of potential collaborating devices is
essential for the effective execution of complex computing tasks. This
evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from
potential collaborators, including historical performance and available
resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner
independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data
exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in
significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)
model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent
architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful
computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to
multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics
extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving
task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent
transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,
enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation
time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of
collaborator selection.

### [4] [Narrative-Guided Reinforcement Learning: A Platform for Studying Language Model Influence on Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08785)
*Anup Tuladhar,Araz Minhas,Adam Kirton,Eli Kinney-Lang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Experimental platform combining reinforcement learning with language model reasoning to study how narrative frameworks influence AI decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between AI's decision-making capabilities and narrative reasoning, which have mostly been studied separately, to explore how narrative elements shape reward-based learning.

Method: Dual-system architecture with RL policy for action suggestions and language model processing through narrative frameworks. Implemented in configurable gridworld environment with modular design for controlled testing.

Result: Preliminary implementation provides foundation for studying narrative framework effects on reward-based decisions and exploring interactions between optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning.

Conclusion: The platform enables initial experimentation with narrative elements while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures, facilitating future research on narrative-guided AI decision-making.

Abstract: We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative
elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning
(RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make
decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly
been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a
dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence
reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy
that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that
processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide
decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements
while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement
this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive
both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The
platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental
complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement
learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic
decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action
selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a
foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect
reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between
optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.

### [5] [Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning For Continual Embodied Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08222)
*Minjong Yoo,Jinwoo Jang,Wei-jin Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ExRAP framework enhances LLMs' embodied reasoning for continual instruction following in dynamic environments through exploration-integrated planning and memory-augmented query evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of embodied agents performing continual instruction following tasks in dynamic, non-stationary environments where environmental contexts change over time.

Method: Proposes Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP) framework that combines information-based exploration with LLM-based planning, uses environmental context memory, and implements temporal consistency refinement for query evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates robustness across various embodied instruction following scenarios (VirtualHome, ALFRED, CARLA) with different instruction scales/types and non-stationarity degrees, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches in goal success rate and execution efficiency.

Conclusion: ExRAP effectively grounds task planning in time-varying environmental contexts, balances environmental context memory validity with exploration load, and addresses knowledge decay through temporal consistency refinement, making it suitable for dynamic embodied AI applications.

Abstract: This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)
framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied
agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large
Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently
exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context
memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying
environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following
tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context
memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently
handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,
we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating
the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.
Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not
only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental
context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves
overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency
refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of
knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and
CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied
instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and
types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other
state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal
success rate and execution efficiency.

dataset for musical similarity research using real-world cases. The dataset are
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between architectural theory and operational reality for Level 4 Autonomous Networks, moving beyond reactive automation to achieve genuine cognitive capabilities for self-configuring, self-healing networks.

Method: Implemented Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture with coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid knowledge representation, tested through an empirical case study of a RAN Link Adaptation Agent.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates transformative potential in overcoming traditional autonomy barriers and advancing critical L4-enabling capabilities toward next-generation network objectives.

Abstract: The evolution toward Level 4 (L4) Autonomous Networks (AN) represents a
strategic inflection point in telecommunications, where networks must transcend
reactive automation to achieve genuine cognitive capabilities--fulfilling TM
Forum's vision of self-configuring, self-healing, and self-optimizing systems
that deliver zero-wait, zero-touch, and zero-fault services. This work bridges
the gap between architectural theory and operational reality by implementing
Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture in a functional cognitive
system, deploying coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid
knowledge representation. Through an empirical case study of a Radio Access
Network (RAN) Link Adaptation (LA) Agent, we validate this framework's
transformative potential: demonstrating sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR
sub-6 GHz while achieving 6% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link
Adaptation (OLLA) algorithms and 67% Block Error Rate (BLER) reduction for
ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)
optimization. These improvements confirm the architecture's viability in
overcoming traditional autonomy barriers and advancing critical L4-enabling
capabilities toward next-generation objectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-Investigator AI is an agentic framework that automates Suspicious Activity Report generation with specialized agents for planning, crime detection, intelligence gathering, and compliance validation, significantly improving speed and accuracy while keeping human investigators in the loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SAR generation is high-cost, low-scalability, and current LLMs suffer from factual hallucination, poor crime typology alignment, and limited explainability - posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical AML workflows.

Method: Agentic framework with specialized agents for planning, crime type detection, external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. Features dynamic memory management, AI-Privacy Guard for sensitive data, and real-time validation using Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm.

Result: The system demonstrates versatility across complex financial crime scenarios, streamlining SAR drafting, aligning narratives with regulatory expectations, and enabling compliance teams to focus on higher-order analytical work.

Conclusion: This approach marks a new era in compliance reporting, bringing AI agent benefits to regulatory processes and enabling scalable, reliable, and transparent SAR generation while maintaining human oversight.

Abstract: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a
high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from
factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor
explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains.
This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to
produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with
greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent
advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our
approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,
external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features
dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data
handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge
paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators
remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a
collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We
demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex
financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting,
align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to
focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a
new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI
agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable,
reliable, and transparent SAR generation.

### [9] [TCPO: Thought-Centric Preference Optimization for Effective Embodied Decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08500)
*Kechen Jiao,Zhirui Fang,Jiahao Liu,Bei Li,Qifan Wang,Xinyu Liu,Junhao Ruan,Zhongjian Qiao,Yifan Zhu,Yaxin Xu,Jingang Wang,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCPO method improves embodied AI decision-making by aligning intermediate reasoning processes and using stepwise preference optimization to address model degradation and sparse reward issues in vision language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision language models struggle with dynamic embodied tasks due to sluggish responses, hallucinations, and poor sample efficiency from existing reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought methods that suffer from sparse rewards and action-only optimization.

Method: Proposes Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) with stepwise preference-based optimization to transform sparse rewards into richer step samples, plus Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC) to enforce output consistency and align intermediate reasoning.

Result: Achieves 26.67% average success rate in ALFWorld environment, showing 6% improvement over RL4VLM and effectively mitigates model degradation after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TCPO demonstrates the potential of integrating preference-based learning with chain-of-thought processes to enhance vision-language models' decision-making capabilities in embodied agents.

Abstract: Using effective generalization capabilities of vision language models (VLMs)
in context-specific dynamic tasks for embodied artificial intelligence remains
a significant challenge. Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align
with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and
hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating
further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning
and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and
action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,
and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes
Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied
decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based
optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step
sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning
process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by
incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes
consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld
environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%
improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in
mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the
potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT
processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models
in embodied agents.

*Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using logical consistency between disagreeing LLM judges to detect misaligned grading without ground truth knowledge


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When using LLMs as judges to evaluate other LLMs, infinite monitoring chains are inevitable without ground truth. There's a need to detect misaligned judges without knowing the correct answers.

Method: Formalize logical consistency between disagreeing experts as a Linear Programming problem in integer response counts. Use agreement/disagreement patterns to compute possible evaluations of grading ability.

Result: Developed no-knowledge alarms that can detect with no false positives when at least one member of an ensemble of judges violates specified grading ability requirements.

Conclusion: Logical consistency analysis provides a reliable way to monitor LLM judges without ground truth knowledge, enabling detection of misaligned grading through disagreement patterns.

Abstract: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who
or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever
we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want
to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit
the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how
LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only
possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges
disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be
100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear
Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite
test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges.
The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or
more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability
requirement.

### [11] [Automatic Failure Attribution and Critical Step Prediction Method for Multi-Agent Systems Based on Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08682)
*Guoqing Ma,Jia Zhu,Hanghui Guo,Weijie Shi,Jiawei Shen,Jingjiang Liu,Yidan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel failure attribution framework for multi-agent systems using multi-granularity causal inference, achieving 36.2% step-level accuracy and 22.4% average task success improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diagnostic tools for multi-agent systems rely on statistical correlations and achieve less than 15% accuracy in locating root-cause failures, severely hampering practical deployment of MAS.

Method: Two key technical contributions: (1) performance causal inversion principle that models performance dependencies by reversing data flow in execution logs with Shapley values for agent-level blame assignment; (2) CDC-MAS causal discovery algorithm that identifies critical failure steps by addressing non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data.

Result: Achieves up to 36.2% step-level accuracy on Who&When and TRAIL benchmarks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Generated optimizations boost overall task success rates by an average of 22.4%.

Conclusion: Provides a principled and effective solution for debugging complex agent interactions, enabling more reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems through automated optimization loops validated by counterfactual simulations.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet
their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure
attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,
are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When,
state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the
root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity
causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a
performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance
dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with
Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal
discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps
by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's
attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating
targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual
simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a
significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level
accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success
rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective
solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more
reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel dual-process Theory of Mind framework combining fast graph-based reasoning (System 1) with slow meta-adaptive learning (System 2) using context gate mechanism, validated on false-belief tasks and cognitive bias replication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge artificial intelligence and cognitive theory by creating AI systems that exhibit human-like social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities through dual-process reasoning.

Method: Integrates graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for fast habitual reasoning (System 1) with meta-learning techniques for context-sensitive deliberative reasoning (System 2), using a learned context gate mechanism to dynamically balance both systems.

Result: The model closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust generalization to unseen contexts, and successfully replicates cognitive biases including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing effects, and priming effects.

Conclusion: This work successfully bridges AI and cognitive science, demonstrating that dual-process architectures can produce human-like reasoning patterns and cognitive biases, paving the way for more nuanced AI social cognition systems.

Abstract: We introduce a novel Theory of Mind (ToM) framework inspired by dual-process
theories from cognitive science, integrating a fast, habitual graph-based
reasoning system (System 1), implemented via graph convolutional networks
(GCNs), and a slower, context-sensitive meta-adaptive learning system (System
2), driven by meta-learning techniques. Our model dynamically balances
intuitive and deliberative reasoning through a learned context gate mechanism.
We validate our architecture on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically
explore its capacity to replicate hallmark cognitive biases associated with
dual-process theory, including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing
effects, and priming effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our
dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust
generalization to unseen contexts, and elucidates cognitive mechanisms
underlying reasoning biases. This work bridges artificial intelligence and
cognitive theory, paving the way for AI systems exhibiting nuanced, human-like
social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities.

*Ziming Luo,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Nihar B. Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI scientist systems need scrutiny to prevent workflow flaws that undermine research integrity. This paper identifies four failure modes and demonstrates their presence in existing systems, recommending trace logs and code submission for better detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI scientist systems can accelerate scientific discovery but their internal workflows haven't been closely examined, risking flaws that could compromise research integrity and trustworthiness.

Method: Designed controlled experiments to isolate four potential failure modes (inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, post-hoc selection bias) and assessed two prominent open-source AI scientist systems.

Result: Found presence of several failures across different severity levels that are easily overlooked in practice. Showed that access to trace logs and code enables far more effective failure detection than examining just the final paper.

Conclusion: Journals and conferences should mandate submission of trace logs and code alongside AI-generated research papers to ensure transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

Abstract: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research
workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold
significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the
internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of
scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity,
reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we
identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems:
inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc
selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that
isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI
scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist
systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of
severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate
that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far
more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone.
We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to
mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure
transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

### [14] [Revisiting Deepfake Detection: Chronological Continual Learning and the Limits of Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07993)
*Federico Fontana,Anxhelo Diko,Romeo Lanzino,Marco Raoul Marini,Bachir Kaddar,Gian Luca Foresti,Luigi Cinque*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reframes deepfake detection as a continual learning problem, proposing an efficient framework that adapts to new manipulation techniques while retaining knowledge of past generators, with significant speed improvements but limited future generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies requires frequent and expensive retraining of detection systems, making continual learning approaches necessary to handle emerging manipulation techniques efficiently.

Method: Proposes a continual learning framework for deepfake detection that simulates real-world chronological evolution of deepfake technologies over 7 years, using lightweight visual backbones for real-time performance and introducing two novel metrics (C-AUC and FWT-AUC).

Result: Achieves 155x faster adaptation than full retraining with robust retention of historical knowledge, but generalization to future generators without additional training remains near-random (FWT-AUC ≈ 0.5) due to unique generator imprints.

Conclusion: Current approaches can efficiently adapt to new deepfake generators but cannot generalize to unseen future generators, leading to the proposed Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis that each generator leaves a unique imprint.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.

### [15] [How Far Are We from True Unlearnability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08058)
*Kai Ye,Liangcai Su,Chenxiong Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current unlearnable examples fail to maintain cross-task unlearnability, particularly in multi-task scenarios like semantic segmentation. The study analyzes this through model optimization perspectives, proposes new metrics (SAL and UD) to quantify unlearnability, and benchmarks existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation that current unlearnable examples don't maintain effectiveness across multiple tasks despite models' powerful representation learning capabilities, and to understand why they fail to achieve true cross-task unlearnability.

Method: Analyzed convergence differences between clean and poisoned models using simple architectures, examined loss landscapes, proposed Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify parameter unlearnability, and developed Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure data unlearnability based on SAL distributions.

Result: Found that only part of critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences between clean and poisoned models, revealing a close relationship between loss landscape and unlearnability. Proposed metrics successfully quantify unlearnability boundaries.

Conclusion: Current unlearnable methods have significant limitations in achieving cross-task unlearnability. The proposed SAL and UD metrics provide effective ways to measure and understand these limitations, helping the community better assess the capabilities of existing unlearnable techniques.

Abstract: High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but
the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests
of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been
proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the
training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and
the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these
data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,
they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we
find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks
such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.
This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly
unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective
of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the
convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model
architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of
the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,
implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.
Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons
for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the
unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose
an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the
SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we
conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed
UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of
existing unlearnable methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entity linking is crucial for connecting unstructured text with knowledge graphs, particularly in financial news analytics where JPMorgan spends over $2M annually on external vendor solutions. Accurate entity linking enables access to curated knowledge graph data and improves daily workflow efficiency.

Method: Novel end-to-end multi-neural network architecture designed for computational efficiency in entity linking tasks.

Result: JEL beats current state-of-the-art entity linking models in performance.

Conclusion: The proposed JEL model provides superior entity linking capabilities that can significantly benefit financial news analytics and reduce reliance on expensive external vendor solutions.

Abstract: We present JEL, a novel computationally efficient end-to-end multi-neural
network based entity linking model, which beats current state-of-art model.
Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing
critical relationships among the entities of interest and integrating data from
multiple heterogeneous sources. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph
is linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are
encountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there
are thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking
mentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental
task in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases,
such as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an
essential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm. According to a
survey conducted by the Innovation Digital team 1 , around 25 teams across the
firm are actively looking for news analytics solutions, and more than \$2
million is being spent annually on external vendor costs. Entity linking is
critical for bridging unstructured news text with knowledge graphs, enabling
users access to vast amounts of curated data in a knowledge graph and
dramatically facilitating their daily work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI applications in healthcare require robust evaluation methods that go beyond traditional quantitative benchmarks to ensure clinical validity and generalizability.

Method: Discusses current state-of-the-art evaluation methodologies including human expertise-based assessment and cost-effective computational models as evaluators.

Result: Identifies limitations of train-to-the-test overfitting in quantitative benchmarks and highlights the need for evaluation strategies that maintain generalizability across diverse clinical tasks and data distributions.

Conclusion: Comprehensive evaluation of GenAI in healthcare requires combining quantitative metrics with human expertise and adaptable computational models to ensure clinical relevance and broad applicability.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represent an emerging paradigm
within artificial intelligence, with applications throughout the medical
enterprise. Assessing GenAI applications necessitates a comprehensive
understanding of the clinical task and awareness of the variability in
performance when implemented in actual clinical environments. Presently, a
prevalent method for evaluating the performance of generative models relies on
quantitative benchmarks. Such benchmarks have limitations and may suffer from
train-to-the-test overfitting, optimizing performance for a specified test set
at the cost of generalizability across other task and data distributions.
Evaluation strategies leveraging human expertise and utilizing cost-effective
computational models as evaluators are gaining interest. We discuss current
state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing the performance of GenAI
applications in healthcare and medical devices.

*Lucas Fenaux,Zheng Wang,Jacob Yan,Nathan Chung,Florian Kerschbaum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: New adaptive backdoor attack breaks existing FL defenses with just 1-2 malicious clients, while proposed Hammer and Anvil defense with Krum+ successfully counters these attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is vulnerable to backdoor attacks from malicious clients, and existing defenses fail against adaptive attackers who can bypass current protection mechanisms.

Method: Developed a new adaptive adversary that outperforms existing attackers, then created Hammer and Anvil - a combined defense approach using two orthogonal defense principles to create robust protection.

Result: The new adaptive attack breaks state-of-the-art defenses with only 1-2 malicious clients out of 20. The proposed Krum+ defense successfully counters both the new adaptive adversary and existing state-of-the-art attacks.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the vulnerability of current FL defenses to sophisticated adaptive attacks and provides a principled defense approach that can withstand such attacks through combined orthogonal defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a distributed learning technique in which multiple
clients cooperate to train a machine learning model. Distributed settings
facilitate backdoor attacks by malicious clients, who can embed malicious
behaviors into the model during their participation in the training process.
These malicious behaviors are activated during inference by a specific trigger.
No defense against backdoor attacks has stood the test of time, especially
against adaptive attackers, a powerful but not fully explored category of
attackers. In this work, we first devise a new adaptive adversary that
surpasses existing adversaries in capabilities, yielding attacks that only
require one or two malicious clients out of 20 to break existing
state-of-the-art defenses. Then, we present Hammer and Anvil, a principled
defense approach that combines two defenses orthogonal in their underlying
principle to produce a combined defense that, given the right set of
parameters, must succeed against any attack. We show that our best combined
defense, Krum+, is successful against our new adaptive adversary and
state-of-the-art attacks.

TL;DR: PhysioCLR is a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that incorporates ECG domain knowledge to improve arrhythmia classification with limited labeled data, achieving 12% AUROC improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-based ECG analysis is limited by scarce labeled data. Self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, but existing methods lack integration of physiological knowledge for clinically meaningful representations.

Method: PhysioCLR integrates ECG physiological similarity cues into contrastive learning, uses ECG-specific augmentations that preserve category information, and employs a hybrid loss function to refine learned representations.

Result: Evaluated on Chapman, Georgia, and private ICU datasets, PhysioCLR achieved 12% mean AUROC improvement relative to the strongest baseline, demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: Embedding physiological knowledge into contrastive learning enables learning clinically meaningful and transferable ECG features, offering a promising path for label-efficient ECG diagnostics.

Abstract: Objective: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart
conditions; however, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based
ECG analysis is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning
Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that
incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and
clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During
pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that
share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are
dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological
similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically
meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific
augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a
hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.
Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,
for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for
binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,
PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,
underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding
physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model
to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance:
PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a
promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.

TL;DR: SAPO is a decentralized asynchronous RL algorithm for post-training language models that enables scalable reinforcement learning across heterogeneous compute networks without central bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL post-training for language models requires significant parallelization with high technical challenges and costs. Current approaches face bottlenecks in scaling due to latency, memory, and reliability issues.

Method: Swarm sAmpling Policy Optimization (SAPO) uses a fully decentralized network where each node manages its own policy models and shares rollouts with others. No assumptions about latency, model homogeneity, or hardware are required.

Result: SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments. Successfully tested on a network with thousands of nodes running on diverse hardware and models.

Conclusion: SAPO provides an effective decentralized solution for scaling RL post-training, avoiding common bottlenecks while enabling knowledge propagation across heterogeneous networks.

Abstract: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can
enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as
demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs
requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces
non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)
alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training
algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute
nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts
with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model
homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.
As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL
post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By
sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to
propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show
SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.
We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes
contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse
hardware and models during an open-source demo.

TL;DR: This thesis addresses five key challenges in Federated Learning (FL) - data/device heterogeneity, communication issues, and privacy concerns - by proposing novel approaches that bridge theoretical advancements with practical implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL operates in decentralized, less controlled environments compared to data centers, creating unique challenges that require solutions beyond traditional machine learning approaches. The inclusion of FL in the US National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan highlights its growing importance.

Method: The thesis identifies five core FL challenges and develops novel approaches to address them, focusing on translating theoretical methods into practical implementations while also adapting practical insights back into theoretical algorithm design.

Result: The work advances FL algorithms and systems by creating a bidirectional bridge between theory and practice, enabling more efficient real-world implementations while also informing theoretical developments through practical perspectives.

Conclusion: This research provides a comprehensive guide for translating FL theoretical methods into practical implementations and demonstrates the value of reverse-engineering practical insights to enhance theoretical algorithm design, uncovering new dimensions of FL algorithms.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning
paradigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve
machine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\v{c}}n{\'y} et al.
(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its
inclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023
Update) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).
The FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in
less controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges
distinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we
identify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches
to address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and
devices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.
Moreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse
forms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.
Our contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical
advancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a
guide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical
methods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,
it offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical
implementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse
process is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to
examine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,
often uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.

TL;DR: Extends Credibility Transformer with in-context learning using similar instances to enhance CLS token representations and improve predictive accuracy, especially for unseen categorical features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve model learning and predictive performance by incorporating additional context from similar instances, enabling better adaptation to risk patterns and generalization to new categorical feature levels not seen during training.

Method: Augments the Credibility Transformer architecture with an in-context learning mechanism that uses a context batch of similar instances to enhance CLS token representations through additional information and fine-tuning.

Result: Empirical verification shows enhanced predictive accuracy through adaptation to similar risk patterns and improved generalization to new instances with previously unseen categorical feature levels.

Conclusion: In-context learning effectively enhances the Credibility Transformer's performance by leveraging similar instances, providing better predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities for novel categorical features.

Abstract: The starting point of our network architecture is the Credibility Transformer
which extends the classical Transformer architecture by a credibility mechanism
to improve model learning and predictive performance. This Credibility
Transformer learns credibilitized CLS tokens that serve as learned
representations of the original input features. In this paper we present a new
paradigm that augments this architecture by an in-context learning mechanism,
i.e., we increase the information set by a context batch consisting of similar
instances. This allows the model to enhance the CLS token representations of
the instances by additional in-context information and fine-tuning. We
empirically verify that this in-context learning enhances predictive accuracy
by adapting to similar risk patterns. Moreover, this in-context learning also
allows the model to generalize to new instances which, e.g., have feature
levels in the categorical covariates that have not been present when the model
was trained -- for a relevant example, think of a new vehicle model which has
just been developed by a car manufacturer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting rare, high-impact outcomes in domains like Venture Capital where investors must evaluate startups with limited and noisy early-stage data, requiring both predictive strength and interpretability.

Method: Integrates LLM-powered feature engineering to extract signals from unstructured data, processed through a layered ensemble of models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression) that first produces continuous success likelihood estimates, then thresholds for binary rare-event prediction.

Result: Strong performance with precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random classifier baseline across three independent test subsets. Feature analysis shows startup category (15.6% influence) and number of founders as key predictors, with education level and domain expertise having smaller consistent effects.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines predictive power with interpretability for rare-event prediction, demonstrating practical value in VC decision-making through both high performance and actionable insights into success drivers.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for predicting rare, high-impact outcomes by
integrating large language models (LLMs) with a multi-model machine learning
(ML) architecture. The approach combines the predictive strength of black-box
models with the interpretability required for reliable decision-making. We use
LLM-powered feature engineering to extract and synthesize complex signals from
unstructured data, which are then processed within a layered ensemble of models
including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The ensemble first
produces a continuous estimate of success likelihood, which is then thresholded
to produce a binary rare-event prediction. We apply this framework to the
domain of Venture Capital (VC), where investors must evaluate startups with
limited and noisy early-stage data. The empirical results show strong
performance: the model achieves precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random
classifier baseline in three independent test subsets. Feature sensitivity
analysis further reveals interpretable success drivers: the startup's category
list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by the number of
founders, while education level and domain expertise contribute smaller yet
consistent effects.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of balancing performance and fairness in classification, particularly with intersectional biases and conflicting fairness definitions, while meeting growing regulatory demands for equitable AI.

Method: Uses boosting-based ensemble approaches that dynamically optimize model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse fairness violations, supporting flexible multi-objective optimization.

Result: Enables deployment of context-specific fair models and reliably uncovers intersectional biases often missed by state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: mmm-fair provides a comprehensive open-source solution combining multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, no-code interface, LLM explanations, and deployment-ready models - a unique combination not found in existing fairness tools.

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification requires balancing performance and fairness,
often intensified by intersectional biases. Conflicting fairness definitions
further complicate the task, making it difficult to identify universally fair

optimizes model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse
fairness violations, enabling flexible multi-objective optimization. The system
empowers users to deploy models that align with their context-specific needs

*Ho Ming Lee,Katrien Antonio,Benjamin Avanzi,Lorenzo Marchi,Rui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distance covariance regularization framework for fairness in machine learning that handles multiple protected attributes and prevents fairness gerrymandering in both regression and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness methods focus on binary classification and single attributes, but real-world applications require handling multiple protected attributes simultaneously and preventing disparities in intersectional subgroups, especially for continuous attributes like age.

Method: Proposed distance covariance regularization to mitigate association between predictions and protected attributes, extended with two multivariate dependence measures (joint distance covariance and novel concatenated distance covariance) to address fairness gerrymandering.

Result: The framework effectively captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies, works with various attribute types, and includes calibration methods for regularization strength using Jensen-Shannon divergence to quantify distribution differences across groups.

Conclusion: The approach provides a comprehensive solution for fairness in both regression and classification tasks, demonstrated on COMPAS recidivism and motor insurance datasets, addressing critical gaps in handling multiple protected attributes and intersectional fairness.

Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as
gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing
literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in
regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is
equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous
attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In
practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,
methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called
"fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional
subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we
propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the
association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with
the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear
and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of
multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two
multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously
proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance
covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both
regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various
types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,
including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies
dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our
framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims
dataset.

TL;DR: MARLINE is a novel approach that enables knowledge transfer from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments, even when source and target concepts don't match, by projecting target concepts to source spaces and using ensemble predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches assume at least one source model represents a similar concept to the target, which may not hold in real-world scenarios. Concept drift in online learning impacts predictive performance of data stream mining systems.

Method: Projects target concept to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers to contribute to target prediction as part of an ensemble system.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning approaches.

Conclusion: MARLINE effectively handles concept drift by leveraging multiple data sources without requiring source-target concept matching, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Concept drift is a major problem in online learning due to its impact on the
predictive performance of data stream mining systems. Recent studies have
started exploring data streams from different sources as a strategy to tackle
concept drift in a given target domain. These approaches make the assumption
that at least one of the source models represents a concept similar to the
target concept, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-source mApping with tRansfer LearnIng
for Non-stationary Environments (MARLINE). MARLINE can benefit from knowledge
from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments even when source and
target concepts do not match. This is achieved by projecting the target concept
to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers
to contribute towards the prediction of the target concept as part of an
ensemble. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning
approaches.

Method: Proposed two methods: BR-MARLENE leverages knowledge from different labels in both source and target streams for multi-label classification; BRPW-MARLENE extends this by explicitly modelling and transferring pairwise label dependencies.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show both methods outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches in non-stationary environments.

Conclusion: The methods demonstrate the effectiveness of inter-label knowledge transfer for improved predictive performance in multi-label data streams with concept drift.

Abstract: Label concepts in multi-label data streams often experience drift in
non-stationary environments, either independently or in relation to other
labels. Transferring knowledge between related labels can accelerate
adaptation, yet research on multi-label transfer learning for data streams

methods: BR-MARLENE leverages knowledge from different labels in both source
and target streams for multi-label classification; BRPW-MARLENE builds on this
by explicitly modelling and transferring pairwise label dependencies to enhance
learning performance. Comprehensive experiments show that both methods
outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches in non-stationary

### [30] [Selective Induction Heads: How Transformers Select Causal Structures In Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08184)
*Francesco D'Angelo,Francesco Croce,Nicolas Flammarion*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can dynamically handle varying causal structures through Selective Induction Heads, enabling them to identify correct contextual dependencies and copy tokens from appropriate past positions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on induction heads relies on fixed Markov Chain structures, which cannot capture the dynamic causal relationships found in natural language where token dependencies change with context.

Method: Proposed a framework using interleaved Markov chains with different lags but fixed transition probabilities, enabling transformers to learn Selective Induction Heads that identify the correct causal structure in-context.

Result: Transformers successfully learn to predict next tokens by identifying the correct lag and copying corresponding tokens from the past, with a 3-layer transformer implementation and theoretical proof showing asymptotic convergence to maximum likelihood solution.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of how transformers select causal structures dynamically, providing new insights into their functioning and interpretability beyond fixed Markov Chain approaches.

Abstract: Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modeling
tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this
success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens
based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal
structures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of
induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and
learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal
structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the
relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our
framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with
different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting
unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows
transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure
in-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism
to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the
corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a
3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a
theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to
the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how
transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their
functioning and interpretability.

### [31] [ArtifactGen: Benchmarking WGAN-GP vs Diffusion for Label-Aware EEG Artifact Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08188)
*Hritik Arasu,Faisal R Jahangiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares two generative models (WGAN-GP and diffusion model) for synthesizing realistic EEG artifacts to address the high cost of manual labeling, finding that WGAN-GP achieves better spectral alignment but both models have weak class-conditional recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in EEG data (muscle, eye movement, electrode, chewing, shiver) confound automated analysis but are costly to label at scale. The study aims to determine if modern generative models can synthesize realistic, label-aware artifact segments for augmentation and stress-testing.

Method: Using TUH EEG Artifact corpus with subject-wise splits and fixed-length multi-channel windows. Compared conditional WGAN-GP with projection discriminator to 1D denoising diffusion model with classifier-free guidance. Evaluated along fidelity (spectral metrics, covariance, autocorrelation), specificity (class-conditional recovery), and utility (augmentation effects).

Result: WGAN-GP achieved closer spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data. Both models exhibited weak class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains. The study provides a reproducible pipeline for EEG artifact synthesis.

Conclusion: While WGAN-GP shows better performance in spectral metrics, both generative models have limitations in class-conditional recovery, revealing opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage improvements in future work on EEG artifact synthesis.

Abstract: Artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) -- muscle, eye movement, electrode,
chewing, and shiver -- confound automated analysis yet are costly to label at
scale. We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic,
label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing.
Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and
fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing
tailored to each model (per-window min-max for adversarial training;
per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional
WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with
classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch
band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$),
channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and
distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional
recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation
effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer
spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak
class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing
opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible
pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts --
to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable
failure modes for future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method combining flexible finite-difference scheme and Rollout loss training to improve long-term predictive accuracy of reduced-order models for PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reduced-order models for partial differential equations suffer from degraded predictive power over long time horizons despite being computationally efficient.

Method: Introduced (1) a flexible, high-order, inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to maintain accuracy over arbitrary time horizons.

Result: Demonstrated the approach successfully on the 2D Burgers equation.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances ROM performance for long-term PDE predictions while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical
sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods.
Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction
to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized
families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We
address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive
finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to
make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our
approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

*Caio de Prospero Iglesias,Kimberly Villalobos Carballo,Dimitris Bertsimas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modular framework called Prescribe-then-Select (PS) that first builds a library of feasible candidate policies and then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for given covariates in contextual stochastic optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In contextual stochastic optimization, multiple candidate policies from different modeling paradigms show heterogeneous performance across covariate space, with no single policy uniformly dominating others.

Method: PS framework constructs a library of feasible candidate policies, then uses ensembles of Optimal Policy Trees trained via cross-validation to create a data-driven meta-policy for selecting the best policy based on observed covariates.

Result: PS consistently outperforms the best single policy in heterogeneous regimes across two benchmark problems (newsvendor and shipment planning) and converges to the dominant policy when heterogeneity is absent.

Conclusion: The Prescribe-then-Select framework provides an effective data-driven approach for policy selection in contextual stochastic optimization problems with heterogeneous performance across covariates.

Abstract: We address the problem of policy selection in contextual stochastic
optimization (CSO), where covariates are available as contextual information
and decisions must satisfy hard feasibility constraints. In many CSO settings,
multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit
heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy
uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular
framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and
then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed
covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy
Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice
entirely data-driven. Across two benchmark CSO problems--single-stage
newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning--PS consistently outperforms the
best single policy in heterogeneous regimes of the covariate space and
converges to the dominant policy when such heterogeneity is absent. All the

### [34] [Sketched Gaussian Mechanism for Private Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08195)
*Qiaobo Li,Zhijie Chen,Arindam Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM) combines sketching and Gaussian noise for federated learning, providing stronger privacy guarantees than isolated approaches while maintaining communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address both communication cost and privacy in federated learning by jointly analyzing sketching compression and Gaussian noise mechanisms, rather than treating them separately.

Method: Propose SGM that directly combines sketching (dimension reduction) with Gaussian noise addition, using Rényi-DP for joint privacy analysis and applying to FL with gradient descent or adaptive optimizers.

Result: SGM provides privacy proportional to 1/√b (sketching dimension), offering stronger privacy than original Gaussian mechanism under same noise budget, with only logarithmic dependence on parameter count.

Conclusion: SGM-based FL is competitive with non-sketching private variants and outperforms them in some settings, with adaptive optimization improving performance while maintaining privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Communication cost and privacy are two major considerations in federated
learning (FL). For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the
clients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round
communication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of
clipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee
client-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes
privacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching
provides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to
supply any additional desired privacy.
  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which
directly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using
R\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy
guarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to
isolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the
privacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for
moderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the
original GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM
to FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish
theoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a
logarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results
confirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive
with non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.
Moreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical
performance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are essential paradigms for training
models across decentralized data sources while preserving privacy, yet
communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. This dissertation explores
strategies to improve communication efficiency, focusing on model compression,
local training, and personalization. We establish a unified framework for
biased and unbiased compression operators with convergence guarantees, then
propose adaptive local training strategies that incorporate personalization to
accelerate convergence and mitigate client drift. In particular, Scafflix
balances global and personalized objectives, achieving superior performance
under both IID and non-IID settings. We further introduce privacy-preserving
pruning frameworks that optimize sparsity while minimizing communication costs,
with Cohort-Squeeze leveraging hierarchical aggregation to reduce cross-device
overhead. Finally, SymWanda, a symmetric post-training pruning method, enhances
robustness under high sparsity and maintains accuracy without retraining.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks and large-scale language models demonstrate
favorable trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication, offering

Motivation: Existing critical care datasets like MIMIC and eICU lack the scale, diversity, and longitudinal perspective needed for generalizable clinical AI models. CRITICAL addresses this with multi-institutional data capturing pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU patient journeys across diverse settings.

Method: CRISP systematically processes Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model data through: (1) transparent data quality management with audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary mapping to SNOMED-CT standards with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture for efficient processing (<1 day), and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks.

Result: The pipeline enables complete dataset processing in under 1 day on standard hardware, provides ML-ready datasets, establishes reproducible performance standards through baseline benchmarks, and saves researchers months of preprocessing effort.

Conclusion: CRISP democratizes access to large-scale multi-institutional critical care data by providing a comprehensive preprocessing solution, allowing researchers to focus on advancing clinical AI rather than data preparation challenges.

Abstract: While existing critical care EHR datasets such as MIMIC and eICU have enabled
significant advances in clinical AI research, the CRITICAL dataset opens new
frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion
records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA
institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum
patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both
inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal
perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable
predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness
of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data
harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary
usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.
  We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAPM is a novel pruning metric that reduces catastrophic forgetting to 0.25% while maintaining 99.67% downstream task accuracy by measuring task vector overlap with pre-trained parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models suffer from catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning, which degrades their performance on original capabilities while adapting to new tasks.

Method: Proposes Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM) that uses the ratio of task vectors to pre-trained parameters as a pruning criterion to quantify and mitigate catastrophic forgetting without changing training process or architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments across 8 datasets show FAPM limits catastrophic forgetting to just 0.25% while maintaining 99.67% accuracy on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: FAPM effectively balances catastrophic forgetting and downstream performance through a simple yet effective pruning-based approach that requires no architectural changes or auxiliary data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in various downstream tasks but typically face Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF) during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the
Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to
balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the
degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from
the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model
parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the
ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to
quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly,
FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model
architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive
experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General
Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results
demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\%
accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.

Conclusion: The framework democratizes study of scientific reasoning in VLMs and provides deeper insights into their capabilities and limitations, particularly highlighting challenges in spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to
perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at
many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics,

capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to
rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework
features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over
400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics,

state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale
and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving
an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic

Method: Matrix Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE) that uses regime-switching to dynamically capture covariant dependencies among multiple geographical forecasts with redundancy-aware weighting

Result: MPWE consistently achieved lower mean and standard deviation of prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines across 8 major basins and multiple forecast horizons

Conclusion: The proposed MPWE framework provides both improved accuracy and stability in rainfall forecasting, making it valuable for flood management and disaster preparedness applications in Vietnam

Abstract: Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam is highly challenging due to its diverse
climatic conditions and strong geographical variability across river basins,
yet accurate and reliable forecasts are vital for flood management, hydropower
operation, and disaster preparedness. In this work, we propose a Matrix
Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE), a regime-switching framework that
dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model

contributions across models. We evaluate MPWE using rainfall forecasts from
eight major basins in Vietnam, spanning five forecast horizons (1 hour and
accumulated rainfall over 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 hours). Experimental results
show that MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of
prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines,
demonstrating both improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning AMR models require massive labeled data, making repeated training for model development and hyperparameter tuning time-consuming and energy-intensive.

Method: FoQuS records prediction trajectories during full-dataset training and constructs three importance metrics based on training dynamics to select a coreset from the original dataset.

Result: Experiments show FoQuS maintains high recognition accuracy and good cross-architecture generalization on multiple AMR datasets using only 1%-30% of original data.

Conclusion: FoQuS effectively approximates full training effects while significantly reducing computational overhead, making AMR model development more efficient.

Abstract: Deep learning-based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) model has made
significant progress with the support of large-scale labeled data. However,
when developing new models or performing hyperparameter tuning, the time and
energy consumption associated with repeated training using massive amounts of

TL;DR: EvolKV is an adaptive framework that uses evolutionary search to optimize layer-wise KV cache compression, achieving better performance than heuristic methods while using significantly less memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods rely on heuristics that ignore layer-specific feature patterns and task performance interactions, leading to degraded generalization.

Method: Reformulates cache allocation as multi-objective optimization problem and uses evolutionary search to dynamically configure layer budgets while maximizing downstream performance.

Result: Outperforms all baseline methods on 11 tasks, achieves up to 7% improvement on GSM8K, and surpasses full KV cache performance on code completion using only 1.5% of original budget.

Conclusion: EvolKV demonstrates the untapped potential of learned compression strategies for KV cache budget allocation, showing superior memory efficiency and task performance over heuristic approaches.

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on
heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction
policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific
feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded
generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for
layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory
efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a
multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to
dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream
performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on
long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage
points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV
cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original
budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for
KV cache budget allocation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM tutoring accelerates RL convergence while maintaining optimal performance, with advice reuse further reducing training time but causing less stable convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL algorithms require long training in complex environments, and existing acceleration techniques are domain-specific and require expert knowledge.

Method: Student-teacher architecture using pre-trained LLMs as tutors for RL algorithms (DQN, PPO, A2C), with extensive testing across 54 configurations varying algorithms, LLM models, and environments.

Result: LLM tutoring significantly accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance. Advice reuse further improves training duration but results in less stable convergence dynamics.

Conclusion: LLM tutoring generally improves RL convergence, but effectiveness depends on specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become
useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While
techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate
training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's
professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this
challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL
algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster
convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's
advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical
examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,
PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,
Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly
accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.
Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training
duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings
suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness
is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have massive parameters that impose heavy GPU memory demands, hindering widespread adoption. Existing offloading approaches suffer from poor cache hit rates and significant expert loading latency during inference.

Method: MoEpic vertically divides each expert into top and bottom segments, caches top segments of hot experts to store more experts under limited VRAM, predicts and prefetches activated experts for next layers, and uses a divide-and-conquer algorithm for adaptive cache configuration.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoEpic saves about half of the GPU cost while lowering inference latency by 37.51%-65.73% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MoEpic effectively addresses GPU memory constraints in MoE LLMs through expert segmentation, intelligent caching, and adaptive configuration, enabling more efficient deployment of large MoE models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern
large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU
memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.
Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to
alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches
typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch
experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in
inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading
latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system
with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically
divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot
experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,
thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic
predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top
segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is
reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the
performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each
layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a
divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache
configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that
MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference
latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

*Matan Avitan,Moran Baruch,Nir Drucker,Itamar Zimerman,Yoav Goldberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cutmax is an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that enables efficient greedy decoding under homomorphic encryption, reducing latency by 24x-35x compared to baselines for secure text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns arise when processing sensitive data with LLMs on untrusted servers. Homomorphic encryption enables secure computation but existing decoding methods (argmax, sampling) are computationally expensive under encryption, creating performance bottlenecks.

Method: Introduces cutmax (HE-friendly argmax algorithm) and the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method. Both techniques are polynomial and differentiable, supporting efficient inference and gradient-based sequence-level optimization.

Result: Achieves latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines on realistic LLM outputs. Cutmax converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point in just a few iterations.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques enable practical greedy and stochastic decoding under encryption with provable privacy guarantees, significantly advancing secure text generation capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing
sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic
encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.
However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and
sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under
encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,
an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to
prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also
propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging
cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both
techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving
settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based
sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through
estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,
proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of
the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid
convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show
latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

*Haeun Jeon,Hyunglip Bae,Chanyeong Kim,Yongjae Lee,Woo Chang Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel gradient perturbation method that combines prediction and decision loss gradients to improve decision-focused learning stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) optimizes prediction accuracy but ignores downstream decision quality, while decision-focused learning (DFL) directly optimizes decisions but suffers from unstable convergence due to flat-and-sharp loss landscapes.

Method: Proposes perturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient with a sigmoid-like decaying parameter, creating an update direction that guides training without additional training requirements.

Result: The method achieves lower regret with more stable training across three stochastic optimization problems, outperforming both PFL and DFL baselines in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between stable optimization and decision quality optimization, providing a theoretically guaranteed convergence to Pareto stationary points while being compatible with any DFL solver.

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is often considered in two stages:
predicting the unknown parameters, and then optimizing decisions based on
predictions. While traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) treats these
two stages separately, decision-focused learning (DFL) trains the predictive
model by directly optimizing the decision quality in an end-to-end manner.
However, despite using exact or well-approximated gradients, vanilla DFL often
suffers from unstable convergence due to its flat-and-sharp loss landscapes. In
contrast, PFL yields more stable optimization, but overlooks the downstream
decision quality. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:
perturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to
construct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and
can be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying
parameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient
to train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild
assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic
optimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.
We validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,
even in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.

TL;DR: Vision Language Models (VLMs) outperform CNNs in neutrino interaction classification, offering better performance, interpretability, and flexibility for integrating multimodal data in high-energy physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the application of Vision Language Models (specifically fine-tuned LLaMa 3.2) for identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector data from high-energy physics experiments, leveraging their multimodal reasoning capabilities beyond traditional CNN approaches.

Method: Benchmarked a fine-tuned Vision Language Model (LLaMa 3.2 variant) against state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures used in NOvA and DUNE experiments for classifying electron and muon neutrino events in pixelated detector data.

Result: VLMs outperformed CNNs in classification performance while providing greater interpretability through reasoning-based predictions and better flexibility for integrating auxiliary textual or semantic information.

Conclusion: VLMs show strong potential as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification due to their high performance, interpretability, and generalizability, opening new avenues for multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating
multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

*Kosuke Kihara,Junki Mori,Taiki Miyagawa,Akinori F. Ebihara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Replacing FFREEDA backbone with frozen vision foundation models improves accuracy and reduces costs in class-imbalanced federated learning without complex parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address class imbalances in both source and target domains, label shifts between domains and clients in federated learning scenarios where target data remains unlabeled.

Method: Replace FFREEDA backbone with frozen vision foundation model (VFM) instead of enhancing aggregation or domain adaptation methods.

Result: VFMs effectively mitigate domain gaps, class imbalances, and non-IID-ness among target clients, improving overall accuracy.

Conclusion: Strong feature extractors (VFMs) are more important than complex adaptation or FL methods for real-world federated learning success.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a framework for training models
collaboratively while preserving data privacy of each client. Recently,
research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a
more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains
unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during
pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting:
Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class
imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts
between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing
methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing
aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors
within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a
frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy
without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication
costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs
effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even
non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors,
not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.

*Alicia Tierz,Jad Mounayer,Beatriz Moya,Francisco Chinesta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid framework combining VRRAEs and DeepONets for efficient generative thermal design with continuous latent spaces and accurate gradient prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high computational costs of thermal simulations and limitations of conventional generative models (AEs/VAEs) that produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities.

Method: VRRAE with truncated SVD for continuous, interpretable latent representations + DeepONet using latent encoding in branch network and spatial coordinates in trunk network for temperature gradient prediction.

Result: Enhanced geometry generation quality, improved gradient prediction accuracy, and substantial inference efficiency gains compared to traditional numerical solvers.

Conclusion: Structured latent representations are crucial for operator learning, and combining generative models with operator networks shows great potential for thermal design and engineering applications.

Abstract: Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas
of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost
of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative
models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders
(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which
restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent
solutions.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines
Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,
leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that
mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet
then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with
spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients
efficiently and accurately.
  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries
and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial
advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.
Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent
representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining
generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader
engineering applications.

*Aadit Sengupta,Pratinav Seth,Vinay Kumar Sankarapu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Interpretability should be a core design principle for AI alignment, not just a diagnostic tool, as mechanistic methods provide causal insights into internal failures that behavioral methods may miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large neural models deployed in high-stakes settings need reliable alignment with human values, requiring internal transparency to understand their computations and ensure trustworthy behavior.

Method: Advocates for mechanistic interpretability approaches (circuit tracing, activation patching) over post-hoc methods (LIME, SHAP) to gain causal understanding of model internals and detect deceptive/misaligned reasoning.

Result: Identifies that mechanistic interpretability provides superior causal insights into model failures compared to correlational post-hoc methods, though faces scalability and representation challenges.

Conclusion: Progress on safe AI depends on making interpretability a first-class objective in AI R&D to ensure systems are auditable, transparent, and aligned with human intent.

Abstract: Large neural models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings,
raising concerns about whether their behavior reliably aligns with human
values. Interpretability provides a route to internal transparency by revealing
the computations that drive outputs. We argue that interpretability especially
mechanistic approaches should be treated as a design principle for alignment,
not an auxiliary diagnostic tool. Post-hoc methods such as LIME or SHAP offer
intuitive but correlational explanations, while mechanistic techniques like
circuit tracing or activation patching yield causal insight into internal
failures, including deceptive or misaligned reasoning that behavioral methods
like RLHF, red teaming, or Constitutional AI may overlook. Despite these
advantages, interpretability faces challenges of scalability, epistemic
uncertainty, and mismatches between learned representations and human concepts.
Our position is that progress on safe and trustworthy AI will depend on making
interpretability a first-class objective of AI research and development,
ensuring that systems are not only effective but also auditable, transparent,
and aligned with human intent.

### [51] [Two Sides of the Same Optimization Coin: Model Degradation and Representation Collapse in Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08401)
*Xunkai Li,Daohan Su,Sicheng Liu,Ru Zhang,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoT addresses domain generalization conflicts in graph foundation models by introducing Information Tinker and Regularization Tinker components to prevent model degradation and representation collapse, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph foundation models suffer from domain generalization conflicts that cause imperceptible pitfalls - model degradation (encoder/codebook failing to capture input diversity) and representation collapse (embedding/codebook vectors losing semantic separability), which collectively impair decoder performance and create optimization dilemmas during pre-training.

Method: Proposes MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) with two components: (1) Information Tinker using edge-wise semantic fusion and mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity, and (2) Regularization Tinker with two additional regularizations to improve gradient supervision. The architecture adheres to GFM scaling laws for controllable model scale.

Result: Experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot scenarios compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MoT effectively addresses the Information Bottleneck and Regularization Deficit challenges in graph foundation models, providing a flexible architecture that prevents optimization dilemmas and enables robust cross-domain generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to
learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream
cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE
stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This
is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes
from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic
boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause
imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are
just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model
Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;
Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail
to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation
subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and
generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM
optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical
investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and
Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -
(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic
fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve
information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which
utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision
in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT
adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.
Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains
demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,
and zero-shot scenarios.

*Alireza Sameh,Mehrdad Rostami,Mourad Oussalah,Vahid Farrahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DL algorithms using raw acceleration signals achieved 80-85% accuracy for 24-hour movement behavior classification, slightly outperforming classical ML methods (70-81% accuracy) using handcrafted features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the performance of deep learning and classical machine learning algorithms for classifying 24-hour movement behaviors (sleep, sedentary, LPA, MVPA) from wrist-worn accelerometer data.

Method: Used data from 151 adults wearing wrist accelerometers. Extracted 104 handcrafted features from 10-second windows. Compared 4 DL algorithms (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, 1D-CNN) using raw signals and handcrafted features against 6 classical ML algorithms (RF, SVM, XGBoost, LR, ANN, DT) using handcrafted features only.

Result: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU achieved ~85% accuracy with raw signals, 1D-CNN achieved ~80%. Both DL and classical ML ranged 70-81% accuracy with handcrafted features. Higher confusion between MVPA and LPA categories compared to sleep/sedentary.

Conclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals showed only slightly better performance than DL/classical ML trained with handcrafted features for movement behavior classification.

Abstract: Purpose: We compared the performance of deep learning (DL) and classical
machine learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of 24-hour movement
behavior into sleep, sedentary, light intensity physical activity (LPA), and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Open-access
data from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.
Participants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets
(121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented
into non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted
features were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw
acceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals
to predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were
also used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression
(LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying
24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an
overall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration
signals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on
handcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML
algorithms ranged from 70% to 81%. Overall, there was a higher confusion in
classification of MVPA and LPA, compared to sleep and sedentary categories.
Conclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals had only slightly better
performance in predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities, compared to
when DL and classical ML were trained with handcrafted features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of backpropagation (biologically implausible backward locking) and Forward-Forward algorithm (low accuracy and inference efficiency due to multiple forward passes).

Method: Integrates Forward-Forward algorithm with similarity learning frameworks using tuplet loss, eliminating the need for multiple forward passes during inference.

Result: Achieves 56.22% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MLP, approaching backpropagation's 57.63%. Substantial improvements on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST datasets.

Conclusion: FAUST successfully bridges the accuracy gap with backpropagation while maintaining biological plausibility and improving inference efficiency over original Forward-Forward.

Abstract: Backpropagation is the pivotal algorithm underpinning the success of
artificial neural networks, yet it has critical limitations such as
biologically implausible backward locking and global error propagation. To
circumvent these constraints, the Forward-Forward algorithm was proposed as a
more biologically plausible method that replaces the backward pass with an
additional forward pass. Despite this advantage, the Forward-Forward algorithm
significantly trails backpropagation in accuracy, and its optimal form exhibits
low inference efficiency due to multiple forward passes required. In this work,
the Forward-Forward algorithm is reshaped through its integration with
similarity learning frameworks, eliminating the need for multiple forward
passes during inference. This proposed algorithm is named Forward-Forward
Algorithm Unified with Similarity-based Tuplet loss (FAUST). Empirical
evaluations on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that FAUST
substantially improves accuracy, narrowing the gap with backpropagation. On
CIFAR-10, FAUST achieves 56.22\% accuracy with a simple multi-layer perceptron
architecture, approaching the backpropagation benchmark of 57.63\% accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between traditional actuarial models' interpretability and neural networks' predictive power in insurance pricing applications.

Method: Assigns dedicated neural networks to each covariate and pairwise interaction term with architectural constraints for sparsity, smoothness, and monotonicity requirements.

Result: Outperforms traditional actuarial and state-of-the-art machine learning methods in most cases while offering complete transparency.

Conclusion: The model successfully combines strong predictive capability with full interpretability, making it suitable for practical insurance pricing applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Actuarial Neural Additive Model, an inherently
interpretable deep learning model for general insurance pricing that offers
fully transparent and interpretable results while retaining the strong
predictive power of neural networks. This model assigns a dedicated neural
network (or subnetwork) to each individual covariate and pairwise interaction
term to independently learn its impact on the modeled output while implementing
various architectural constraints to allow for essential interpretability (e.g.
sparsity) and practical requirements (e.g. smoothness, monotonicity) in
insurance applications. The development of our model is grounded in a solid
foundation, where we establish a concrete definition of interpretability within
the insurance context, complemented by a rigorous mathematical framework.
Comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy are made with traditional actuarial
and state-of-the-art machine learning methods using both synthetic and real
insurance datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other
methods in most cases while offering complete transparency in its internal
logic, underscoring the strong interpretability and predictive capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing complexity of IT systems challenges DevOps teams in maintaining stability and reliability. Log analysis provides critical insights but requires automation to handle complex behaviors and failures efficiently.

Method: Three-layer architecture: 1) Log Investigation - autonomous log labeling and anomaly classification with taxonomy; 2) Anomaly Detection - flexible method for unsupervised/weakly supervised/supervised training; 3) Root Cause Analysis - identifies minimal log sets describing failures and event sequences.

Result: F1-scores of 0.98-1.0 for anomaly detection on public and industry datasets. Root cause analysis detects 90-98% of root cause log lines within top 10 candidates. Provides actionable insights for failure mitigation.

Conclusion: The integrated three-layer architecture provides robust methods for DevOps teams to enhance IT system reliability through automated log analysis, enabling efficient failure resolution without manual effort.

Abstract: In the evolving IT landscape, stability and reliability of systems are
essential, yet their growing complexity challenges DevOps teams in
implementation and maintenance. Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides
critical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation
introduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure
resolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log
labeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data
without manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of
anomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies
into three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,
Anomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a
flexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,
and supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show
F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third
layer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,
their origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying
key services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of
root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable
insights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be
designed and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By
integrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust
methods to enhance IT system reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing process mining research evaluates algorithms on fixed event logs but lacks systematic analysis of how specific event log characteristics individually impact algorithm performance, especially considering that characteristics co-occur in real-world processes.

Method: The SHAining approach quantifies marginal contributions of varying event log characteristics to process mining metrics. Using process discovery as a downstream task, it analyzes over 22,000 event logs covering diverse characteristics to assess their impact on metrics like fitness, precision, and complexity.

Result: The approach uncovers which event log characteristics affect algorithms across different metrics the most and provides insights about how characteristic values correlate with their contributed impact, assessing algorithm robustness.

Conclusion: SHAining provides the first systematic quantification of how event log characteristics impact process mining algorithm performance, offering valuable insights into algorithm robustness and the relationship between characteristic values and their effects on evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Process mining aims to extract and analyze insights from event logs, yet
algorithm metric results vary widely depending on structural event log
characteristics. Existing work often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of
real-world event logs but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log
characteristics impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are
generated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we focus on
associational rather than causal effects to assess how strong the overlapping
individual characteristic affects evaluation metrics without assuming isolated
causal effects, a factor often neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining,
the first approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event log
characteristics to process mining algorithms' metrics. Using process discovery
as a downstream task, we analyze over 22,000 event logs covering a wide span of
characteristics to uncover which affect algorithms across metrics (e.g.,
fitness, precision, complexity) the most. Furthermore, we offer novel insights
about how the value of event log characteristics correlates with their
contributed impact, assessing the algorithm's robustness.

TL;DR: Recasting equivariant force field models as deep equilibrium models to exploit temporal continuity in molecular dynamics, achieving 10-20% improvements in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the prior knowledge that molecular dynamics simulations are continuous and successive states are extremely similar, which hasn't been fully exploited in machine learning force fields.

Method: Transform a state-of-the-art equivariant base model into a deep equilibrium model to recycle intermediate neural network features from previous time steps.

Result: Achieved 10-20% improvements in both accuracy and speed on MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets compared to non-DEQ base models, with more memory-efficient training.

Conclusion: Exploiting temporal continuity through deep equilibrium models significantly enhances performance and efficiency in machine learning force fields for molecular dynamics simulations.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields show great promise in enabling more accurate
molecular dynamics simulations compared to manually derived ones. Much of the
progress in recent years was driven by exploiting prior knowledge about
physical systems, in particular symmetries under rotation, translation, and
reflections. In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of
prior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular
system is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely
similar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by
recasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium
model. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from
previous time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by
$10\%-20\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ
base model. The training is also much more memory efficient, allowing us to

*Matias D. Cattaneo,Boris Shigida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis shows Polyak heavy-ball momentum gradient descent is equivalent to plain gradient descent with a modified loss on attractive manifolds, with arbitrary precision approximation bounds and rich combinatorial structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mathematical structure and behavior of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, particularly its equivalence to modified loss gradient descent and the combinatorial patterns in its approximations.

Method: Proved equivalence between HB and modified loss gradient descent on attractive manifolds, conducted fine-grained combinatorial analysis of memoryless approximations, derived continuous modified equations with rigorous bounds.

Result: Established global approximation bounds O(h^R) for any finite order R≥2, discovered rich polynomial family containing Eulerian and Narayana polynomials, generalized principal flow approximation for HB dynamics.

Conclusion: HB momentum provides exact equivalence to modified loss gradient descent with exponential memory decay, revealing complex combinatorial structure and enabling high-order approximations for both full-batch and mini-batch settings.

Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed
momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory.
Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially
attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent
with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although
the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with
arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation
bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a
fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless
approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in
$\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We
derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with
rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics,
generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch
and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features
of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for
similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.

TL;DR: AgentGym-RL is a new reinforcement learning framework for training LLM agents from scratch without supervised fine-tuning, featuring modular architecture and supporting diverse real-world scenarios with a novel ScalingInter-RL training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The community lacks a unified interactive RL framework that can effectively train autonomous LLM agents from scratch across diverse environments without relying on supervised fine-tuning.

Method: Introduces AgentGym-RL framework with modular architecture and ScalingInter-RL training approach that balances exploration-exploitation by gradually increasing interaction horizons.

Result: Agents match or surpass commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments, demonstrating stability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework provides key insights and will be open-sourced to empower development of next-generation intelligent agents through stable RL training.

Abstract: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent
decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like
human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and
skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite
advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --
without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to
train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The
framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high
flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world
scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose
ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation
balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation
by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards
exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving
strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less
prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to
validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and
the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on
27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will
open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets
-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of
intelligent agents.

*Chisom Chibuike,Adeyinka Ogunsanya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparison of 10 optimizers for heart disease prediction using MLP, finding RMSProp most effective with balanced performance across precision, recall, AUC and training speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of systematic approach for optimizer selection in deep learning, need to understand metrics that determine optimal optimizer choice for training.

Method: Evaluated 10 optimizers on MLP model with heart disease dataset using consistent training paradigm, measuring convergence speed, stability, AUC, precision, and recall.

Result: RMSProp performed best overall with precision 0.765, recall 0.827, AUC 0.841 and faster training time. Trade-offs observed between stability and convergence speed.

Conclusion: Recommends thorough optimizer evaluation in less compute-constrained environments to improve scientific rigor and model performance in deep learning training.

Abstract: Optimization has been an important factor and topic of interest in training
deep learning models, yet less attention has been given to how we select the
optimizers we use to train these models. Hence, there is a need to dive deeper
into how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that
determine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10
different optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a
heart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and
evaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and
stability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such
as AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification
problems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed
and stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,
took longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be
the most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it
offered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of
0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.
However, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less
compute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a
thorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and
performance in training deep learning models.

TL;DR: AI agent using deep reinforcement learning optimizes patient transfer decisions in mass casualty incidents, significantly outperforming human experts and enabling non-experts to achieve expert-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass casualty incidents overwhelm healthcare systems and require rapid, accurate patient-hospital allocation decisions under extreme pressure, creating a critical need for decision support systems.

Method: Developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based AI agent that balances patient acuity, care requirements, hospital capacities, and transport logistics. Created MasTER dashboard for simulations and conducted user study with 30 participants across different AI interaction approaches.

Result: Increasing AI involvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. AI outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to achieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting with their inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001).

Conclusion: The AI-driven decision support system shows strong potential to enhance both MCI preparedness training and real-world emergency response management by improving decision quality and enabling non-experts to perform at expert levels.

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) overwhelm healthcare systems and demand rapid,
accurate patient-hospital allocation decisions under extreme pressure. Here, we
developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-support AI
agent to optimize patient transfer decisions during simulated MCIs by balancing
patient acuity levels, specialized care requirements, hospital capacities, and
transport logistics. To integrate this AI agent, we developed MasTER, a
web-accessible command dashboard for MCI management simulations. Through a
controlled user study with 30 participants (6 trauma experts and 24
non-experts), we evaluated three interaction approaches with the AI agent
(human-only, human-AI collaboration, and AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI
scenarios in the Greater Toronto Area. Results demonstrate that increasing AI
involvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI
agent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to
achieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their
significantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001). These findings
establish the potential for our AI-driven decision support to enhance both MCI
preparedness training and real-world emergency response management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT) is a lightweight framework that efficiently distills reasoning capabilities from multiple teachers into compact students by alternating teacher-specific fine-tuning and weight-space merging, achieving superior performance with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reasoning distillation assumes a single oracle teacher, but multiple candidate teachers are practically available. Different students have different best teachers, and even for the same student the best teacher varies across datasets, requiring a method to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities while overcoming supervision conflicts.

Method: Propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT) framework that alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and weight-space merging of the resulting student variants, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples.

Result: On competition math benchmarks, MoT applied to Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B, QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1. Consistently outperforms best single-teacher distillation and naive multi-teacher union, raises performance ceiling while mitigating overfitting, shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level teachers.

Conclusion: MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general reasoning beyond mathematics, cultivates better teachers, and demonstrates that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. It provides a simple, scalable route to efficiently distill long CoT capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is
increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite
practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora.
We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different
"best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across
datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into
student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we
propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that
alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and
weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math
benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a
Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,
QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT
consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive
multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating
overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level
teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general
reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating
that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results
position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT
capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

Motivation: To address efficiency and scalability challenges in pairwise constraint-based active clustering for large-scale data processing in applications like data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model pre-training.

Method: Proposes a graph-based active clustering algorithm utilizing two sparse graphs: one for representing data relationships (data skeleton) and another for updating this skeleton, enabling refinement of connected subgraphs to create nested clusters.

Result: The algorithm achieves more accurate clustering with dramatically fewer user-provided constraints, outperforms counterparts in computational performance and scalability, and maintains robustness across various distance metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the threefold goals of reducing computational costs, enhancing constraint impact, and cutting memory usage while delivering superior clustering performance for large-scale data applications.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise
constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in
applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model
pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for
iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided
constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3)
to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we
propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse
graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data
skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in
concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data
skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the
proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with
dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its
counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while
maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.

Conclusion: Presents a powerful unified framework demonstrating the synergy of advanced spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust epidemiological forecasting, with publicly available modular pipeline.

Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public
health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal
Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves
robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web
search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive
spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into
seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid
feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba
state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal
convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention
mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.
Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,
with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on
over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period),
MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model
fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956.
Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal
fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible
pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to
other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a
powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced

Motivation: Tabular data applications in fields like finance and healthcare require both high predictive performance and interpretability, but current DNNs for tabular data are blackboxes with little interpretability.

Method: Uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to learn a dictionary of monosemantic features in the latent space, then employs an automated method to assign human-interpretable semantics to these features, representing predictions as linear combinations of semantically meaningful components.

Result: Empirical evaluations show XNNTab achieves performance on par with or exceeding state-of-the-art black-box neural models and classical machine learning approaches.

Conclusion: XNNTab provides a fully interpretable neural architecture for tabular data that maintains competitive predictive performance while offering transparent, semantically meaningful explanations for predictions.

Abstract: Tabular data is the foundation of many applications in fields such as finance

introduce XNNTab, a neural architecture that uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to
learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space used for

### [66] [An upper bound of the silhouette validation metric for clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08625)
*Hugo Sträng,Tai Dinh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to derive data-dependent upper bounds for silhouette width and average silhouette width (ASW) that are often much lower than the theoretical maximum of 1, providing more realistic quality assessment for clustering results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard upper limit of 1 for ASW is often unattainable in practice, making it difficult to assess how close a clustering result is to the best possible outcome for a specific dataset. There's a need for dataset-specific bounds to better evaluate clustering quality.

Method: The authors derive sharp upper bounds for individual data points' silhouette width by analyzing the dataset structure, then aggregate these individual bounds to create a canonical data-dependent upper bound on ASW.

Result: The proposed bounds are provably near-tight across synthetic and real datasets, often assuming values well below 1, and significantly enrich cluster quality evaluation by providing realistic performance benchmarks.

Conclusion: These data-dependent bounds enable better assessment of clustering quality, help determine if individual points can be well-placed, allow for early stopping in optimization loops, and answer the key question of how close a clustering result is to the dataset-specific optimum.

Abstract: The silhouette coefficient summarizes, per observation, cohesion versus
separation in [-1, 1]; the average silhouette width (ASW) is a common internal
measure of clustering quality where higher values indicate more coveted
results. However, the dataset-specific maximum of ASW is typically unknown, and
the standard upper limit 1 is often unattainable. In this work, we derive for
each data point in a given dataset a sharp upper bound on its silhouette width.
By aggregating these individual bounds, we present a canonical data-dependent
upper bound on ASW that often assumes values well below 1. The presented bounds
can indicate whether individual data points can ever be well placed, enable
early stopping of silhouette-based optimization loops, and help answer a key
question: How close is my clustering result to the best possible outcome on
this specific data? Across synthetic and real datasets, the bounds are provably
near-tight in many cases and offer significant enrichment of cluster quality
evaluation.

TL;DR: GDR framework uses generative models to transform problematic datasets into safe, high-quality training data by generating synthetic alternatives that preserve diversity while removing private/unsafe content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data exhaustion by leveraging user-generated content that's currently unusable due to privacy and safety concerns, enabling access to vast untapped data sources.

Method: Uses pretrained generative models to create synthetic data conditioned on real examples, removing undesirable content while maintaining dataset diversity without complex prompting.

Result: Outperforms industry-grade anonymization solutions, enables detoxification of highly unsafe datasets, and naturally matches web-scale dataset diversity.

Conclusion: GDR provides a simple yet effective solution to scale training data for frontier models by safely incorporating currently unusable user-generated content.

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily
determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently,
training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on
the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more
data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but
incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private
information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative
Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a
dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable
for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade
solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of
highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data
that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs
naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the
often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model
prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for
scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

Motivation: Replicability is a fundamental challenge in scientific disciplines including ML. RL algorithms are particularly unstable in practice, and while replicable algorithms exist for tabular RL, extending these to practical function approximation settings remained an open problem.

Method: Developed replicable methods for linear function approximation in RL. Introduced two efficient algorithms for replicable random design regression and uncentered covariance estimation, then leveraged these tools to create provably efficient replicable RL algorithms for linear MDPs in both generative model and episodic settings.

Result: Successfully developed the first provably efficient replicable RL algorithms for linear function approximation. Experimental evaluation shows these algorithms can inspire more consistent neural policies.

Conclusion: This work makes significant progress in addressing replicability challenges in RL by providing the first provably efficient replicable algorithms for linear function approximation settings, bridging the gap between theoretical replicability guarantees and practical RL applications.

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many
scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on
the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that
an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different
samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are
especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are
known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular
RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function
approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make
progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in
RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design
regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest.
We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable
RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model
and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and
show how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Developed Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) to quantify diagnostic data quality in dementia EHRs and showed SFI-aware calibration significantly improves ML model performance across healthcare systems without needing outcome labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models trained on EHRs degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional shift, particularly diagnostic signal decay - variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions that affects code reliability.

Method: Built simulation framework with 2,500 synthetic datasets (1,000 patients each) with realistic demographics and coding patterns. SFI derived from six components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency, entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory stability. Applied SFI-aware calibration with multiplicative adjustment optimized across 50 simulation batches.

Result: At optimal parameter (α=2.0), SFI-aware calibration significantly improved all metrics (p<0.001): 10.3% Balanced Accuracy, 32.5% Recall, 31.9% Precision, 26.1% F1-score. Performance approached reference standards with F1/Recall within 1% and Balanced Accuracy/Detection Rate improved by 52.3%/41.1%.

Conclusion: Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides practical, label-free strategy to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, especially for large administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health
records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional
shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay:
variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which
affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.
  \textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying
diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware
calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets
without outcome labels.
  \textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic
datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and
coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six
interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,
entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory
stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized
across 50 simulation batches.
  \textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware
calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from
10.3\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\% for Recall, with notable increases in
Precision (31.9\%) and F1-score (26.1\%). Performance approached reference
standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\% and Balanced Accuracy and
Detection Rate improved by 52.3\% and 41.1\%, respectively.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model
generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides a practical, label-free strategy

*Delio Jaramillo-Velez,Charul Rajput,Ragnar Freij-Hollanti,Camilla Hollanti,Alexandre Graell i Amat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel secure aggregation method for federated learning using torus instead of finite fields, achieving perfect privacy without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy risks in federated learning by ensuring perfect privacy through uniform distribution masking, while avoiding accuracy-complexity tradeoffs of finite field approaches.

Method: Proposes secure parameter aggregation using the torus (rather than finite fields) to leverage uniform distribution properties, enabling perfect privacy preservation without the accuracy limitations of fixed-point modular arithmetic.

Result: Experimental results show the torus-based protocol performs similarly to non-secure models while maintaining perfect privacy, and significantly outperforms finite field secure aggregation in model accuracy and cosine similarity.

Conclusion: Torus-based secure aggregation provides a safer choice for federated learning by guaranteeing perfect privacy without sacrificing model accuracy, overcoming limitations of previous finite field approaches.

Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their
parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global
model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,
secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to
enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a
uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a
problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals
that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is
bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,
but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due
to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can
simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel
secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather
than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's
data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding
accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs
similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect
privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based
protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model
accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) is invasive and time-consuming for identifying speech-critical cortical regions during brain surgery planning. A non-invasive alternative is needed.

Method: Analyzed ECoG data from 16 participants performing speech tasks, developed ML models combining neural activity, anatomical regions, and functional connectivity features. Used ESM-derived ground truth labels to train classification models with trial-level predictions aggregated via MLP.

Result: Best model (RBF-kernel SVM with MLP aggregation) achieved ROC-AUC: 0.87 and PR-AUC: 0.57 on held-out participants. Models combining region and connectivity features outperformed single-feature models.

Conclusion: Combining spatial and network information with non-linear modeling provides effective non-invasive functional mapping for presurgical evaluation, potentially reducing reliance on invasive ESM.

Abstract: Identifying cortical regions critical for speech is essential for safe brain
surgery in or near language areas. While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM)
remains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To
address this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from
16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models
to directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is
critical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived
independently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train
classification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals,
anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both
local activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining
region and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature
set, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each
electrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to
histogram-encoded scores. Our best-performing model, a trial-level RBF-kernel
Support Vector Machine together with MLP-based aggregation, achieved strong
accuracy on held-out participants (ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57). These findings
highlight the value of combining spatial and network information with
non-linear modeling to improve functional mapping in presurgical evaluation.

*Shun Takagi,Satoshi Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel server extension using ephemeral TEE to achieve maliciously secure DP-FTRL with verifiable proofs and client auditing, maintaining privacy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP-FTRL approaches assume semi-honest server and don't address malicious settings, while TEE implementations face forking attacks and availability issues due to state management problems.

Method: Introduces a trusted computing base (TCB) with ephemeral TEE module on server to produce verifiable proofs of server actions, with selected clients auditing these proofs with minimal overhead.

Result: Formal proofs demonstrate privacy guarantee in malicious settings, experimental results show small constant overhead to clients in realistic scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully reduces TCB size while maintaining system scalability and liveness, providing maliciously secure DP-FTRL with practical efficiency.

Abstract: In cross-device private federated learning, differentially private
follow-the-regularized-leader (DP-FTRL) has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving method. However, existing approaches assume a semi-honest
server and have not addressed the challenge of securely removing this
assumption. This is due to its statefulness, which becomes particularly
problematic in practical settings where clients can drop out or be corrupted.
While trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious
solution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or
availability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper
introduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB)
to realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral
TEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions.
Some clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with
small additional communication and computational demands. This extension
solution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability
and liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential
privacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings. Finally, we
experimentally show that our framework adds small constant overhead to clients
in several realistic settings.

*Ahmed Sadaqa,Di Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid pruning framework combining channel and layer pruning to reduce CNN complexity while maintaining accuracy, enabling efficient deployment on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing size and complexity of CNNs pose challenges for deployment on edge devices, requiring effective model compression techniques.

Method: Proposes a hybrid pruning framework inspired by EfficientNet, applying reverse scaling principles through combined channel and layer pruning to reduce network complexity.

Result: Experiments showed significant complexity reduction with minimal accuracy loss, resulting in reduced latency when deployed on NVIDIA JETSON TX2 embedded AI device.

Conclusion: The hybrid pruning approach effectively balances model compression and performance, making large CNNs more suitable for edge device deployment.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant breakthroughs
in various fields. However, these advancements have led to a substantial
increase in the complexity and size of these networks. This poses a challenge
when deploying large and complex networks on edge devices. Consequently, model
compression has emerged as a research field aimed at reducing the size and
complexity of CNNs. One prominent technique in model compression is model
pruning. This paper will present a new technique of pruning that combines both
channel and layer pruning in what is called a "hybrid pruning framework".
Inspired by EfficientNet, a renowned CNN architecture known for scaling up
networks from both channel and layer perspectives, this hybrid approach applies
the same principles but in reverse, where it scales down the network through
pruning. Experiments on the hybrid approach demonstrated a notable decrease in
the overall complexity of the model, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy
compared to the baseline model. This complexity reduction translates into
reduced latency when deploying the pruned models on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2
embedded AI device.

*Xuefeng Gao,Jiale Zha,Xun Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models used to generate SDE sample paths without knowing drift/diffusion coefficients, outperforming traditional methods and enhancing financial portfolio optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating stochastic differential equations require explicit knowledge of drift and diffusion coefficients, which may not be available in real-world applications. A model-free, data-driven approach is needed.

Method: Uses conditional diffusion models to generate new synthetic paths from finite sets of existing SDE sample paths, taking a model-free approach that doesn't require explicit coefficient specifications.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness through simulation experiments comparing with benchmark methods including neural SDEs, and shows improved performance in reinforcement learning for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection.

Conclusion: Diffusion models show promising applications in financial analysis and decision-making, providing a powerful data-driven alternative to traditional SDE simulation methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of
generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike
the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit
specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a
model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an
SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths
of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a
simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones
including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these
synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of
reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio
selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial
analysis and decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChemBOMAS is an LLM-enhanced multi-agent system that accelerates Bayesian optimization in chemistry through knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained optimization, achieving 96% success in real-world pharmaceutical experiments compared to experts' 15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian optimization in chemistry faces limitations due to sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms, requiring a more efficient approach to accelerate chemical discovery.

Method: Uses LLMs to intelligently decompose search space (knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization) and generate pseudo-data points to enhance BO process within candidate regions (data-driven fine-grained optimization).

Result: Achieved 96% optimal objective value in wet-lab pharmaceutical experiments, significantly outperforming domain experts' 15%. Benchmark evaluations confirmed superior optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.

Conclusion: ChemBOMAS is a powerful tool that significantly accelerates chemical discovery through LLM-enhanced Bayesian optimization, demonstrating practical utility in real-world pharmaceutical applications.

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered
by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced
Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization
process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:
knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained
optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,
LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing
chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in
the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process
within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby
improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark
evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances
optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.
Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab
experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting
conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical
reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value
of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.
This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark
evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical
discovery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PracMHBench, the first system platform for evaluating model-heterogeneous federated learning under practical edge device constraints, analyzing various algorithms across different data scenarios and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FL assumes identical model architectures, but model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible for edge devices with diverse resource constraints. No prior work has quantitatively analyzed existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms under practical edge constraints.

Method: The authors constructed PracMHBench platform to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL algorithms on practical edge device constraints. They classified diverse model heterogeneity algorithms and tested them on multiple data tasks and metrics.

Result: Extensive experiments were performed on various algorithms under different edge constraints to observe their applicability and corresponding heterogeneity patterns.

Conclusion: The work provides a systematic evaluation framework for model-heterogeneous FL, enabling better understanding of algorithm performance under practical edge device constraints.

Abstract: Federating heterogeneous models on edge devices with diverse resource
constraints has been a notable trend in recent years. Compared to traditional
federated learning (FL) that assumes an identical model architecture to
cooperate, model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible since the
model can be customized to satisfy the deployment requirement. Unfortunately,
no prior work ever dives into the existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms
under the practical edge device constraints and provides quantitative analysis
on various data scenarios and metrics, which motivates us to rethink and
re-evaluate this paradigm. In our work, we construct the first system platform
\textbf{PracMHBench} to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL on practical
constraints of edge devices, where diverse model heterogeneity algorithms are
classified and tested on multiple data tasks and metrics. Based on the
platform, we perform extensive experiments on these algorithms under the
different edge constraints to observe their applicability and the corresponding
heterogeneity pattern.

*Mominul Rubel,Adam Meyers,Gabriel Nicolosi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLM is a novel neural network architecture that represents multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier series using cosine activations to learn frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts as trainable parameters, outperforming established models like SIREN on PDEs and optimal control problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a neural network architecture that can represent complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple dimensions and adapt to both periodic and nonperiodic functions, addressing limitations of previous Fourier-inspired models.

Method: Uses a feedforward structure with cosine activation functions where frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts are learned as trainable parameters, establishing one-to-one correspondence between Fourier coefficients and network parameters.

Result: FLM achieves comparable and often superior performance to SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs on benchmark PDEs and optimal control problems, demonstrating effective problem-specific spectral basis adaptation.

Conclusion: The FLM architecture successfully represents multidimensional Fourier series, provides interpretable parameters, and shows strong performance on scientific computing tasks, establishing a new standard for Fourier-based neural networks.

Abstract: We introduce the Fourier Learning Machine (FLM), a neural network (NN)
architecture designed to represent a multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier
series. The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation
functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series
as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a
problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic
functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first
architecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple
dimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A
one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and
phase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,
separable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we
evaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,
including benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of
Optimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the
performance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established
architectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs.

*Ali Amini,Mohammad Alijanpour,Behnam Latifi,Ali Motie Nasrabadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADHDeepNet - a deep learning model using EEG signals achieves near-perfect accuracy (99.17%) for ADHD diagnosis with 100% sensitivity, employing temporal-spatial characterization and explainability techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early ADHD diagnosis is crucial but labor-intensive. The paper aims to improve diagnosis precision and timeliness using deep learning and EEG signals to address the challenges in traditional diagnostic methods.

Method: Developed ADHDeepNet DL model with comprehensive temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability techniques. Used 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 controls) with nested cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, and Additive Gaussian Noise for data augmentation.

Result: Achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in ADHD/HC classification. Model explainability analysis identified key brain regions and frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, with t-SNE visualization aiding decision interpretation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the strong potential of deep learning combined with EEG signals for highly accurate and efficient ADHD diagnosis, offering a promising alternative to traditional labor-intensive diagnostic approaches.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in
children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and
career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients
and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This
paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and
timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive
temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability
techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction
and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and
validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),
employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed
two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.
Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner
2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various
standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.
ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC
subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and
frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and
activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding
in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of
DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides foundation for scalable, AI-driven monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator management through consolidated research and engineering practices in TinyML applications for beekeeping.

Abstract: Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem

survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and
apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive
conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and
forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including
publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for
embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints.
Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and
deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside
emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge

### [80] [Teamwork as Linear Interpersonal Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08811)
*Andrew Jun Lee,Grace Qiyuan Miao,Rick Dale,Alexia Galati,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a context matrix as a unified representation of interpersonal dynamics that captures both synchrony/coordination and directional influence between individuals, validated through simulations and human eye-tracking data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing measures of interpersonal dynamics (CRQA, correlation, Granger causality, transfer entropy) only capture single dimensions - either synchrony or direction of influence, but lack a psychologically meaningful unified representation.

Method: Developed a sequential Bayesian model to infer context matrices from timeseries data, validated through noisy simulations, then applied to human eye-tracking data to extract psychologically interpretable summary features of synchrony and directional influence.

Result: The context matrix accurately recovered ground truth in simulations. In human data, its summary features captured task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics, predicted task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and showed correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality).

Conclusion: The context matrix provides a psychologically meaningful unified representation of interpersonal dynamics that bridges synchrony and directional influence, offering a foundation for broader modeling of interpersonal coordination and influence.

Abstract: Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which
individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing
measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger
causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension:
either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between
individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation
that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We
propose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix is
the transition matrix in a linear dynamical system, with entries specifying how
much each individual's current behavior is attributable to their own versus
every other group member's past behaviors. Its values can be distilled into
psychologically interpretable summary features of synchrony and directional
influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is
provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that
infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately
recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human
eyetracking data, we show that summary features of the inferred context
matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or
lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and
show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality).
We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for
modeling interpersonal dynamics.
