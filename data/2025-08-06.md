### [1] [Efficient Agents: Building Effective Agents While Reducing Cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02694)
*Ningning Wang,Xavier Hu,Pai Liu,He Zhu,Yue Hou,Heyuan Huang,Shengyu Zhang,Jian Yang,Jiaheng Liu,Ge Zhang,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in LLM-driven agent systems, proposing a cost-effective framework (Efficient Agents) that reduces costs by 28.4% while maintaining 96.7% performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The escalating costs of LLM-driven agents threaten scalability and accessibility, necessitating cost-effective designs without performance loss.

Method: The study investigates task complexity, module utility, and efficiency gains through empirical analysis on the GAIA benchmark, using the cost-of-pass metric.

Result: Efficient Agents reduces operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228 (28.4% improvement) while retaining 96.7% performance of OWL.

Conclusion: The work provides insights for designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, enhancing AI accessibility and sustainability.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility
and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

### [2] [Planning with Dynamically Changing Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02697)
*Mikhail Soutchanski,Yongmei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses planning problems where objects dynamically change, proposing a first-order logic approach without the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). It ensures finite actions, bounds plan length, and proves soundness and completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical planning problems involve dynamic object sets, which classical and conformant planning assumptions (like DCA) don't accommodate.

Method: Formulates planning in first-order logic, grounds actions at planning time, and bounds plan length.

Result: Soundness and completeness are proven; the approach solves bounded planning problems without DCA.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles dynamic object sets and is implemented as a proof-of-concept planner.

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

### [3] [Recovering Individual-Level Activity Sequences from Location-Based Service Data Using a Novel Transformer-Based Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02734)
*Weiyu Luo,Chenfeng Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VSNIT, a novel method combining Insertion Transformer and Variable Selection Network, effectively recovers missing segments in sparse LBS data, outperforming baselines in accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse LBS data leads to incomplete trip and activity sequences, hindering accurate mobility analysis. The study aims to recover these sequences at the individual level.

Method: Proposes VSNIT, integrating Insertion Transformer for sequence construction and Variable Selection Network for dynamic covariate handling, to recover missing segments while preserving existing data.

Result: VSNIT inserts diverse, realistic activity patterns, matches real-world variability, and outperforms baselines in all metrics.

Conclusion: VSNIT enhances LBS data utility for mobility analysis, offering a promising framework for future location-based research.

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS
data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This
study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework
for future location-based research and applications.

### [5] [Cognitive Loop via In-Situ Optimization: Self-Adaptive Reasoning for Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02789)
*Newman Cheng,Gordon Broadbent,William Chappell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLIO, a cognitive loop method for AI reasoning, enhancing LLMs' problem-solving and adaptability in scientific discovery, outperforming GPT-4.1 with a 161.64% relative accuracy increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI lacks steerability and transparency for scientific discovery, needing a method that allows deep control over reasoning processes.

Method: CLIO enables LLMs to self-formulate problem approaches, adapt behavior, and provide transparent reasoning via graph structures and uncertainty measures.

Result: CLIO with GPT-4.1 achieves 22.37% accuracy on HLE, a 161.64% improvement over base GPT-4.1, and surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance.

Conclusion: CLIO's open design and internal uncertainty measures offer valuable insight and control for scientific decision-making.

Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test
altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition
that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape
falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that
natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

### [6] [A Multi-Agent System for Complex Reasoning in Radiology Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02841)
*Ziruo Yi,Jinyu Liu,Ting Xiao,Mark V. Albert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent system (MAS) improves radiology visual question answering (RVQA) by addressing challenges like factual accuracy and hallucinations, outperforming multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance RVQA by tackling issues like factual inaccuracies and cross-modal misalignment in existing MLLM and RAG-based methods.

Method: Introduces a MAS with specialized agents for context understanding, multimodal reasoning, and answer validation, evaluated on a challenging RVQA dataset.

Result: The MAS outperforms strong MLLM baselines, demonstrating reliability and interpretability in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Multi-agent approaches show promise for explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications requiring complex reasoning.

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to
questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While
recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex
reasoning.

### [7] [Seemingly Simple Planning Problems are Computationally Challenging: The Countdown Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02900)
*Michael Katz,Harsha Kokel,Sarath Sreedharan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new planning benchmark using the game Countdown to address the inadequacy of existing benchmarks for evaluating foundational models' long-term planning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for planning are insufficient, either being too loosely defined or tailored for automated planners, failing to measure foundational models' planning abilities effectively.

Method: The authors introduce a procedure for creating a benchmark based on the Countdown game, analyzing its computational complexity and advantages over existing benchmarks.

Result: The proposed benchmark is computationally challenging (NP-complete) and remains difficult for existing LLM-based planning methods, unlike simpler domains like the 24 Game.

Conclusion: The Countdown-based benchmark effectively addresses the limitations of current planning benchmarks and provides a robust measure for evaluating foundational models' planning capabilities.

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

### [8] [Enhancing Japanese Large Language Models with Reasoning Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02913)
*Carolina Minami Oguchi,Leo Wei,Koyo Kobayashi,Hsin-Tai Wu,Dipak Ghosal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method using reasoning vectors from reasoning LLMs to enhance Japanese LLMs, addressing resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving Japanese LLMs is challenging due to resource limitations, unlike mainstream LLMs.

Method: Extract reasoning vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs.

Result: Effective performance boost for Japanese LLMs despite resource constraints.

Conclusion: A simple, resource-efficient approach to enhance Japanese LLMs, potentially applicable to other languages.

Abstract: Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the
reasoning capability for mainstream large language models (LLMs), but the same
is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources
required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before
and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning
vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their
performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve
Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement
and hope to inspire for other languages.

### [9] [PentestJudge: Judging Agent Behavior Against Operational Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02921)
*Shane Caldwell,Max Harley,Michael Kouremetis,Vincent Abruzzo,Will Pearce*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PentestJudge is an LLM-based system for evaluating penetration testing agents using hierarchical rubrics, achieving an F1 score of 0.83 compared to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the operational quality of penetration testing agents in a scalable and practical way, where manual evaluation is impractical.

Method: Uses a tree-structured rubric to break down tasks into simpler sub-tasks, evaluated by an LLM-as-judge with tool access. Compares LLM scores to human expert evaluations.

Result: Best model achieves an F1 score of 0.83. Models better at tool-use align more with human judgments. Weaker models can judge stronger ones, suggesting verification is easier than generation.

Conclusion: PentestJudge provides a scalable method for evaluating AI security agents, with potential for confident deployment in sensitive environments.

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

### [10] [AQUAH: Automatic Quantification and Unified Agent in Hydrology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02936)
*Songkun Yan,Zhi Li,Siyu Zhu,Yixin Wen,Mofan Zhang,Mengye Chen,Jie Cao,Yang Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AQUAH is an end-to-end language-based agent for hydrologic modeling, automating tasks from data retrieval to report generation using vision-enabled LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline complex environmental modeling and bridge the gap between Earth observation data, physics-based tools, and decision makers.

Method: AQUAH uses vision-enabled large language models to interpret maps and rasters, autonomously retrieving data, configuring models, running simulations, and generating reports.

Result: Initial experiments show AQUAH completes cold-start simulations and produces clear, transparent, and plausible results without manual intervention.

Conclusion: AQUAH demonstrates the potential of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to simplify hydrologic modeling, though further calibration is needed for operational use.

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,
transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation
are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

### [11] [MedBLINK: Probing Basic Perception in Multimodal Language Models for Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02951)
*Mahtab Bigverdi,Wisdom Ikezogwo,Kevin Zhang,Hyewon Jeong,Mingyu Lu,Sungjae Cho,Linda Shapiro,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Medblink benchmark evaluates MLMs on perceptual tasks, revealing significant gaps (65% accuracy vs. human 96.4%), highlighting the need for improved visual grounding for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MLMs' perceptual abilities in medical imaging, as errors in simple tasks hinder clinical adoption.

Method: Medblink benchmark with 1,429 questions across 8 tasks and 1,605 images, testing 19 MLMs (general and domain-specific).

Result: Best MLM achieved 65% accuracy, far below human performance (96.4%).

Conclusion: Current MLMs lack perceptual reliability, necessitating better visual grounding for clinical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is
contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce
Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our
project page.

### [12] [Polymath: A Self-Optimizing Agent with Dynamic Hierarchical Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02959)
*Chia-Tung Ho,Jing Gong,Xufeng Yao,Yunsheng Bai,Abhishek B Akkur,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Polymath is a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflows, improving performance by 8.1% over baselines without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual embedding of LLMs into agentic systems limits scalability and efficiency, and existing automated methods rely on labeled data, which is impractical for dynamic problems.

Method: Polymath uses task flow graphs and code-represented workflows, optimized via multi-grid-inspired graph optimization and a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm.

Result: Achieves 8.1% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines on six benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Polymath addresses the limitations of labeled data dependency and manual workflow design, offering a scalable solution for dynamic problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The self-consciousness method provides a lightweight, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, beneficial for GenAI applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

TL;DR: A unified approach for tool integration in LLMs reduces development overhead and improves performance through automated schema generation and concurrent execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmented ecosystem of tool-augmented LLMs requires navigating multiple protocols and complex workflows, creating inefficiencies.

Method: Proposes a protocol-agnostic design with automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent execution, and multi-source tool management.

Result: Achieves 60-80% code reduction, 3.1x performance improvements, and full compatibility with existing standards.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical and practical solutions for efficient tool integration in LLM applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up
to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing
function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights
into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM
application development.

*Fangyi Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews the emerging 'agent-as-a-judge' paradigm, where AI agents evaluate LLM outputs, discussing its evolution, strengths, and challenges, and its role in scalable, trustworthy evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating LLM outputs in open-ended tasks is a bottleneck; AI agents as evaluators offer scalable, nuanced alternatives to human judgment.

Method: The review defines the agent-as-a-judge concept, traces its evolution, compares approaches (reliability, cost, alignment), and surveys real-world deployments.

Result: Agent-based judging complements human oversight but faces challenges like bias, robustness, and meta-evaluation.

Conclusion: Agent-as-a-judge is a promising step toward scalable, trustworthy evaluation for next-gen LLMs, though challenges remain.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

*Yutong Wang,Pengliang Ji,Kaixin Li,Baolong Bi,Tao Feng,Guillaume Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BPO is a three-stage framework (bootstrapping, extrapolation, refinement) for improving large language reasoning models in sparse-reward, interactive environments, achieving state-of-the-art results with token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in applying large language models to multi-round agentic planning, such as intractable credit assignment and computational overhead of verbose reasoning histories.

Method: Proposes BPO: bootstrapping with planning quaternions, extrapolation via complexity-stratified curriculum learning, and refinement through reward-gated rejection sampling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and WebShop with significant token efficiency.

Conclusion: BPO provides a scalable and efficient framework for robust reasoning models in long-horizon, sparse-reward environments.

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collab-Solver introduces a multi-agent policy learning framework for MILP, optimizing interdependent modules collaboratively via a Stackelberg game, improving solving speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MILP methods treat policy learning in solver modules independently, ignoring interdependence, which harms performance.

Method: A two-phase learning paradigm: pretraining with data communication, followed by orchestrated policy learning for modules, formulated as a Stackelberg game.

Result: Significant performance improvement on synthetic and real-world MILP datasets, with strong generalization across instance sets.

Conclusion: Collab-Solver's collaborative approach enhances MILP solving by addressing module interdependence, demonstrating superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores In-Context Learning (ICL) in LLMs for solving ODEs, showing GPT-2 can learn meta-ODE algorithms with performance comparable to Euler method and exponential accuracy gains with more demonstrations. It also generalizes to OOD problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nonlinear behavior of ICL in NLP tasks by investigating its application to solving ODEs.

Method: Formulate ODE problems as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on these tasks, testing convergence and generalization.

Result: GPT-2 learns meta-ODE algorithms effectively, matches or outperforms Euler method, and shows exponential accuracy gains with more demonstrations. It also generalizes to OOD problems.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into ICL mechanisms in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms
of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

*Qi Peng,Jialin Cui,Jiayuan Xie,Yi Cai,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR), a multi-agent framework to enhance LLMs' reasoning depth in complex medical diagnosis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs lack sufficient reasoning depth for complex medical tasks, leading to diagnostic errors.

Method: ToR uses a tree structure to record reasoning paths and clinical evidence, with a cross-validation mechanism for consistency.

Result: Experiments show ToR outperforms baseline methods on real-world medical data.

Conclusion: ToR improves LLMs' clinical reasoning in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

*Rui Pu,Chaozhuo Li,Rui Ha,Litian Zhang,Lirong Qiu,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Cognitive-Driven Defense (CDD) framework to protect LLMs from jailbreak attacks by mimicking human reasoning and using reinforcement learning for generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against jailbreak attacks rely on shallow pattern matching, which fails against novel strategies.

Method: CDD uses meta-operations to analyze prompts, combines supervised fine-tuning with entropy-guided reinforcement learning (EG-GRPO) for generalization.

Result: CDD achieves state-of-the-art defense performance and generalizes well to unseen attacks.

Conclusion: The CDD framework effectively addresses the limitations of current defenses by leveraging structured reasoning and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

*Shuang Liu,Zelong Li,Ruoyun Ma,Haiyan Zhao,Mengnan Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ContractEval benchmarks open-source vs. proprietary LLMs for legal risk analysis, finding proprietary models generally better but some open-source ones competitive. Key insights include model size, reasoning mode, and quantization tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if open-source LLMs can match proprietary ones in legal risk analysis while ensuring data confidentiality.

Method: Assessed 4 proprietary and 15 open-source LLMs using the CUAD dataset for clause-level legal risk identification.

Result: Proprietary models outperform open-source ones, though some open-source models are competitive. Key findings include model size impact, reasoning mode effects, and quantization tradeoffs.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs need fine-tuning for legal tasks. ContractEval provides a benchmark for future legal-domain LLM development.

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

*Fei Liu,Yilu Liu,Qingfu Zhang,Xialiang Tong,Mingxuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD) to generate complementary heuristic sets for diverse problem instances, improving generalization over single-heuristic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) methods use a single heuristic for all problem instances, leading to poor generalization.

Method: Proposes AHSD, a monotone and supermodular formulation, and EoH-S with complementary population management and memetic search to generate heuristic sets.

Result: EoH-S outperforms state-of-the-art AHD methods by up to 60% on diverse tasks.

Conclusion: AHSD and EoH-S effectively address generalization issues in AHD, offering significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MissDDIM, a conditional diffusion framework, addresses high latency and output variability in DDPMs for tabular data imputation by adapting DDIM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DDPM-based methods for missing data imputation suffer from high inference latency and variable outputs, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The paper introduces MissDDIM, a conditional diffusion framework adapting Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for tabular imputation.

Result: MissDDIM aims to reduce inference latency and output variability compared to stochastic DDPMs.

Conclusion: MissDDIM offers a more practical solution for tabular data imputation by addressing key limitations of DDPMs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved
variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

*Xingjun Ma,Hanxun Huang,Tianwei Song,Ye Sun,Yifeng Gao,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T2UE introduces a framework for generating unlearnable examples (UEs) using only text descriptions, avoiding the need for original image data and resolving privacy concerns in data protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the privacy paradox in current UE methods, which require exposing data to third-party services for protection.

Method: Uses a text-to-image model to map text descriptions into noise space and an error-minimization framework to create unlearnable noise.

Result: T2UE significantly degrades downstream task performance for state-of-the-art models and generalizes across architectures.

Conclusion: T2UE enables zero-contact data protection, safeguarding personal data without direct exposure.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

Motivation: The rise of LLMs and misinformation necessitates advanced detection methods beyond binary judgments, requiring verifiable and transparent reasoning.

Method: The agent uses three core tools (web search, source credibility assessment, numerical claim verification) for multi-step verification, evidence logging, and comprehensive assessments.

Result: The agent outperforms baseline methods in accuracy, reasoning transparency, and robustness against rewritten content on datasets like FakeNewsNet.

Conclusion: The proposed agent offers a trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking paradigm, enhancing misinformation detection with verifiable reasoning.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of
misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research
proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses
information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete
verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three
core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

TL;DR: The paper proposes AgentSME, a generative agent framework for smart education using LLMs, evaluating three communication modes (Solo, Mono, Echo) for accuracy and diversity. Echo mode achieves the highest accuracy, while DeepSeek shows the most diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of educational contexts and the need for personalized human-to-human communication in pedagogy drive the development of tailored generative agent models.

Method: AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLMs, is proposed. Three communication modes (Solo, Mono, Echo) are tested across six LLMs, with accuracy and diversity metrics.

Result: Echo communication mode achieves the highest accuracy, and DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity in reasoning contents.

Conclusion: The study offers insights to enhance agent learning capabilities and inspire smart education models, highlighting the effectiveness of Echo mode and diversity in LLMs.

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are
critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the
inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with
various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on
personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper
proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three
directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

Result: The OptiTrust agent outperforms others, achieving highest accuracy on 6 out of 7 datasets, with at least 8% improvement on three.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, verifiable, and principled method for developing dependable LLM agents for optimization.

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7

Abstract: We present the $Y_0$ Python package, which implements causal identification
algorithms that apply interventional, counterfactual, and transportability
queries to data from (randomized) controlled trials, observational studies, or

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with formal geometric reasoning, especially in dynamically constructing and verifying auxiliary elements, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: Geoint-R1 combines auxiliary element construction, Lean4 formal reasoning, and interactive visualization to generate verifiable geometric solutions from text and diagrams.

Result: Geoint-R1 outperforms existing models on the Geoint benchmark, excelling in problems requiring auxiliary element constructions.

Conclusion: Geoint-R1 advances formal geometric reasoning, offering a scalable and verifiable solution for complex geometric problems.

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and
educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal
verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying
auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce
Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for selecting study partners lack scientific planning or flexibility, hindering knowledge expansion in inquiry-oriented learning.

Method: The model uses generative agents to capture learner features and an adaptive matching algorithm with Gaussian process augmentation to identify knowledge patterns.

Result: InqEduAgent performs optimally in various knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environments.

Conclusion: The study advances intelligent partner allocation, combining human and AI-based learning partners, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However,
most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments

This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting

Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of

### [33] [Full-History Graphs with Edge-Type Decoupled Networks for Temporal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03251)
*Osama Mohammed,Jiaxin Pan,Mojtaba Nayyeri,Daniel Hernández,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a full-history graph and Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) to model evolving interactions among entities, outperforming baselines in driver-intention prediction and fraud detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use snapshot graphs for temporal evolution, but tasks like predicting driver maneuvers or detecting fraud require explicit reasoning about interactions and their evolution over time.

Method: Proposes a full-history graph with intra- and inter-time-step edges, and ETDNet with parallel modules for graph-attention and temporal-attention, fused after each layer.

Result: ETDNet achieves 75.6% joint accuracy on Waymo (vs. 74.1%) and 88.1% F1 on Elliptic++ (vs. 60.4%), demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: Representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single graph improves modeling of evolving interactions.

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single
graph.

*Shaofeng Yin,Ting Lei,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset, addresses gaps in real-world tool-use proficiency for LFMs by featuring diverse tasks and multi-step reasoning. ToolEngine, a novel pipeline, generates the dataset, and fine-tuned LFMs outperform GPT-3.5-turbo on OOD datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks show gaps in real-world tool-use proficiency for LFMs, especially in multimodal, multi-step reasoning tasks. ToolVQA aims to bridge this gap with realistic data.

Method: ToolVQA is created using ToolEngine, a pipeline with DFS and dynamic in-context example matching. It includes 10 multimodal tools across 7 domains, with 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.

Result: Fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA perform well on the test set and surpass GPT-3.5-turbo on OOD datasets, showing strong generalizability.

Conclusion: ToolVQA and ToolEngine effectively enhance LFMs' real-world tool-use proficiency, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

### [35] [Nemori: Self-Organizing Agent Memory Inspired by Cognitive Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03341)
*Jiayan Nan,Wenquan Ma,Wenlong Wu,Yize Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Nemori is a self-organizing memory architecture for LLMs, addressing memory granularity and adaptive learning, outperforming prior systems in long contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack persistent memory in long-term interactions, and existing memory systems have limitations in granularity and passive learning.

Method: Nemori uses a Two-Step Alignment Principle for organizing conversations into coherent episodes and a Predict-Calibrate Principle for adaptive learning.

Result: Nemori outperforms state-of-the-art systems on benchmarks like LoCoMo and LongMemEval, especially in longer contexts.

Conclusion: Nemori provides a viable solution for long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents by addressing foundational memory limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its
advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

### [36] [Adaptive AI Agent Placement and Migration in Edge Intelligence Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03345)
*Xingdan Wang,Jiayi He,Zhiqing Tang,Jianxiong Guo,Jiong Lou,Liping Qian,Tian Wang,Weijia Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for deploying and managing LLM-based AI agents in edge environments to reduce latency and improve efficiency, addressing challenges like resource constraints and QoS maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for real-time AI agents is growing, but cloud-based deployments introduce latency. Edge deployment improves efficiency but faces resource and QoS challenges.

Method: Proposes an adaptive framework using ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for agent placement and migration, focusing on resource and latency/cost modeling.

Result: Implemented on a distributed system, the solution reduces deployment latency and migration costs significantly.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses edge deployment challenges for LLM-based AI agents, optimizing resource use and QoS.

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

*Zeju Li,Jianyuan Zhong,Ziyang Zheng,Xiangyu Wen,Zhijian Xu,Yingying Cheng,Fan Zhang,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel CoT compression framework using step entropy identifies redundant reasoning steps, enabling 80% pruning with minimal accuracy loss. A two-stage training strategy (SFT + GRPO) teaches LLMs to generate compressed CoTs, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs with CoT prompting produce verbose and redundant reasoning steps, increasing inference costs and reducing efficiency. Addressing this redundancy can enhance practical deployment.

Method: Introduces step entropy to quantify redundancy, prunes low-entropy steps, and employs a two-stage training strategy (SFT + GRPO) to teach LLMs to generate compressed CoTs using [SKIP] tokens.

Result: 80% of low-entropy steps can be pruned with minor accuracy loss, contrasting sharply with random or high-entropy pruning. The method improves efficiency while preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment and deeper insights into reasoning structures, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogBench evaluates LLMs for cross-lingual and cross-site cognitive impairment assessment, showing LLMs with chain-of-thought prompting and LoRA fine-tuning outperform conventional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for cognitive impairment assessment lack generalizability across languages and clinical settings, limiting practical use.

Method: Proposes CogBench, a benchmark using a multimodal pipeline to evaluate LLMs on English and Mandarin speech datasets (ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, CIR-E). Tests chain-of-thought prompting and LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: LLMs with chain-of-thought prompting adapt better than conventional models, though sensitive to prompts. LoRA fine-tuning significantly improves generalization.

Conclusion: LLMs, especially with LoRA, offer a promising approach for robust, cross-lingual cognitive assessment tools.

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

*Michael K. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares integrative and hybrid neurosymbolic approaches for general logical reasoning in LLMs, concluding the hybrid approach (LLM-SS) is more promising due to interpretability and retaining LLM advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of domain-agnostic logical reasoning in LLMs, which lack deterministic reasoning and interpretability.

Method: Compare two neurosymbolic approaches (integrative: LNN; hybrid: LLM-SS) on domain-agnostic tasks.

Result: Hybrid approach (LLM-SS) outperforms due to interpretable reasoning chains and leveraging LLM strengths.

Conclusion: Proposes a modular, model-agnostic framework based on LLM-SS for future hybrid neurosymbolic AI development.

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes UML2Dep, a framework using enhanced UML diagrams and data dependency inference to improve code generation from ambiguous natural language descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plain textual descriptions for code generation are ambiguous and fail to capture complex requirements, necessitating a formal, unambiguous approach.

Method: Introduces enhanced UML sequence diagrams with decision tables and API specs, and a data dependency inference (DDI) task formalized as constrained mathematical reasoning.

Result: The framework reduces ambiguity, enhances reasoning accuracy, and improves efficiency in code generation.

Conclusion: UML2Dep effectively bridges the gap between ambiguous NL descriptions and precise code generation for complex requirements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

*Rui Zou,Mengqi Wei,Yutao Zhu,Jirong Wen,Xin Zhao,Jing Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework to improve LLMs' error diagnosis by generating and detecting subtle errors, showing significant accuracy gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with identifying complex errors due to training focused on correct answers, lacking exposure to errors.

Method: HSG uses adversarial roles (Sneaky for error generation, Diagnosis for detection) to enhance error stealth and diagnostic precision.

Result: HSG improves error diagnosis by 16.8%--31.4% over baselines like GPT-4o on math tasks.

Conclusion: HSG effectively enhances LLMs' diagnostic ability and provides a benchmark dataset for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

*Kai Li,Ruihao Zheng,Xinye Hao,Zhenkun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOID combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization to diagnose and suggest fixes for infeasible routing models, outperforming existing LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods fail to consider multiple potential adjustments for infeasible routing models, limiting their practicality.

Method: MOID integrates LLM agents with multi-objective optimization to generate trade-off solutions and actionable insights for infeasible models.

Result: MOID outperforms existing methods by providing diverse diagnostic suggestions in a single run, aiding feasibility restoration.

Conclusion: MOID offers a more practical and automated approach for diagnosing and resolving infeasible routing models.

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using LLM agents to extract and enhance biomedical knowledge from PubMed abstracts into a knowledge graph, improving accuracy with context variables and exploring relationship inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of medical data overwhelms professionals, creating a gap between literature and application, necessitating automated knowledge extraction.

Method: A pipeline of LLM agents decomposes PubMed abstracts into propositions, extracts KG triples, enhances them with ontological data, and adds context to form quadruples.

Result: The system achieved an average cosine similarity of 0.874 for generated sentences from enhanced triples, outperforming ordinary triples.

Conclusion: The approach offers a real-time, centralized knowledge source for medical practitioners and potential applications in other fields.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

### [45] [Toward a Graph-Theoretic Model of Belief: Confidence, Credibility, and Structural Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03465)
*Saleh Nikooroo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-based formalism for belief systems, distinguishing credibility and confidence, to better represent internal structure and coherence without requiring belief updating or deductive closure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representations of belief systems (e.g., probabilistic or logical models) obscure internal structure, conflate credibility with coherence, and cannot model fragmented or contradictory states.

Method: Proposes a directed, weighted graph framework where nodes are beliefs, edges represent epistemic relationships, and two functions assign credibility (source trust) and confidence (structural support).

Result: The model provides a static, foundational substrate for analyzing belief organization, coherence, and epistemic tensions, enabling richer classification of epistemic states.

Conclusion: This formalism offers a more nuanced representation of belief systems, addressing limitations of classical probabilistic, logical, and argumentation-based approaches.

Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions
or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to
obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with
internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

TL;DR: SmartGen is an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior data to adapt smart home models to behavioral drift, improving anomaly detection by 85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static datasets make smart home models brittle to behavioral drift (e.g., seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts). Collecting new data is impractical due to cost, privacy, and slow pace.

Method: SmartGen includes: 1) Time and Semantic-aware Split, 2) Semantic-aware Sequence Compression, 3) Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, and 4) Two-stage Outlier Filter.

Result: Experiments show SmartGen improves anomaly detection by 85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average.

Conclusion: SmartGen effectively addresses behavioral drift in smart homes by generating realistic behavior data, enhancing model adaptability.

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

### [48] [Error Detection and Correction for Interpretable Mathematics in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03500)
*Yijin Yang,Cristina Cornelio,Mario Leiva,Paulo Shakarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EDCIM is a method for detecting and correcting errors in LLM-generated mathematical tasks, balancing cost and accuracy using a mix of lightweight and powerful models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce intermediate errors and struggle with hallucinations and output format adherence, especially in interpretable mathematics tasks.

Method: EDCIM generates a system of equations, detects errors symbolically, and provides feedback for correction, using a mix of lightweight and proprietary LLMs controlled by a hyperparameter.

Result: EDCIM reduces costs while maintaining or improving accuracy, as shown in experiments across datasets.

Conclusion: EDCIM effectively addresses LLM error propagation and cost-efficiency in interpretable mathematics tasks.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

### [49] [Hidden Dynamics of Massive Activations in Transformer Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03616)
*Jorge Gallego-Feliciano,S. Aaron McClendon,Juan Morinelli,Stavros Zervoudakis,Antonios Saravanos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the emergence of massive activations in transformers during training, revealing predictable patterns and a framework to predict them from model design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the temporal dynamics of massive activations in transformers, which are critical for model functionality but poorly studied during training.

Method: Systematic analysis of the Pythia model family across training checkpoints, modeling activation patterns with an exponentially-modulated logarithmic function and predicting parameters from architectural specs.

Result: Massive activation emergence follows predictable patterns; a machine learning framework predicts parameters with high accuracy for steady-state and moderate accuracy for timing/magnitude.

Conclusion: Massive activation emergence is governed by model design, enabling prediction and control before training, impacting stability, training length, interpretability, and optimization.

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

*Jialin Li,Jinzhe Li,Gengxu Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FPBench is a framework evaluating LLMs' code generation under faulty premises, revealing poor reasoning, diminishing returns, and distinct defect patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' reliance on faulty premises and their lack of self-scrutiny in code generation.

Method: FPBench systematically constructs three faulty premise categories and uses multi-dimensional metrics to assess 15 LLMs.

Result: Most models perform poorly under faulty premises, show diminishing returns, and exhibit distinct defect patterns.

Conclusion: FPBench highlights the need for LLMs to verify premises and offers a pathway for reliable, human-centric code generation.

Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models
(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

TL;DR: Evo-MCTS improves gravitational-wave signal detection by combining tree search, evolutionary optimization, and LLM heuristics, outperforming existing methods by 20.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of MF (computational demands) and DNNs (lack of interpretability) in gravitational-wave signal identification.

Method: Proposes Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), integrating tree search, evolutionary optimization, and LLM heuristics for interpretable solutions.

Result: Achieves 20.2% improvement over state-of-the-art methods on MLGWSC-1 dataset, with high-performing variants exceeding thresholds.

Conclusion: Evo-MCTS offers a transferable methodology for automated algorithmic discovery, revealing novel combinations and interpretable pathways.

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent Lightning is a framework for RL-based training of LLMs for AI agents, decoupling execution and training for seamless integration with existing agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods tightly couple RL training with agents or rely on masking, limiting flexibility. Agent Lightning aims to decouple these for broader compatibility.

Method: Formulates agent execution as a Markov decision process, introduces a unified data interface, and proposes LightningRL, a hierarchical RL algorithm with credit assignment.

Result: Enables RL to handle complex logic (multi-agent, dynamic workflows) and shows stable improvements in tasks like text-to-SQL and math tool-use.

Conclusion: Agent Lightning offers a flexible, standardized approach for real-world agent training and deployment.

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.

TL;DR: BH-PEFT integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT for LLMs, enabling uncertainty quantification and dynamic adaptation, outperforming existing methods in business tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid PEFT methods lack uncertainty quantification and dynamic adaptation for specialized LLM applications.

Method: Combines Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning with Bayesian learning to model parameters as distributions and enable dynamic fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms PEFT baselines in tasks like sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense reasoning.

Conclusion: BH-PEFT enhances reliability and adaptability in real-world LLM applications, advancing business analytics and data science.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
reshaping the world. As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they
often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in
specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce
training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT
techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT
methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized
applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify
uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically
adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We
propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel
method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines
Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers
of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT
enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic
fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next
round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on
business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense
reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines,
enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves
adaptability in dynamic scenarios. This work contributes to business analytics
and data science by proposing a novel BH-PEFT method and dynamic fine-tuning
approach that support uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in
real-world situations.

Abstract: This work introduces ZetA, a novel deep learning optimizer that extends Adam
by incorporating dynamic scaling based on the Riemann zeta function. To the
best of our knowledge, ZetA is the first optimizer to apply zeta-based gradient
scaling within deep learning optimization. The method improves generalization
and robustness through a hybrid update mechanism that integrates adaptive
damping, cosine similarity-based momentum boosting, entropy-regularized loss,
and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)-style perturbations. Empirical
evaluations on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and noisy CIFAR10 consistently
show test accuracy improvements over Adam. All experiments employ a lightweight
fully connected network trained for five epochs under mixed-precision settings.
The results demonstrate that ZetA is a computationally efficient and robust
alternative to Adam, particularly effective in noisy or high-granularity
classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems often fail in real-world deployments due to model mismatches from environmental uncertainties. Current methods rely on simulators or offline data, which are impractical.

Method: Proposes the Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI) algorithm for online learning in DRMGs, optimizing worst-case performance over uncertainty sets.

Result: RONAVI achieves low regret and efficiently finds optimal robust policies for uncertainty sets measured by Total Variation and Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Conclusion: The work establishes a practical approach for developing robust multi-agent systems through online learning, without dependency on prior data.

Abstract: Well-trained multi-agent systems can fail when deployed in real-world
environments due to model mismatches between the training and deployment
environments, caused by environment uncertainties including noise or
adversarial attacks. Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance
system resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set
of environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their
dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often
unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where
agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We
introduce the {\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm
and provide the first provable guarantees for this setting. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently
finds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total
Variation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results establish a
new, practical path toward developing truly robust multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To transform healthcare into a more accurate, individualized paradigm by simulating patient-specific ECG digital twins tailored to various conditions.

Method: Uses a two-stage approach: (1) Individual Base Extractor via contrastive learning to capture personal features, and (2) diffusion-based generation with AdaX Condition Injector for condition-specific ECG synthesis.

Result: Generates high-fidelity, diverse ECG signals with fine-grained controllability while preserving individual features, and enhances downstream ECG auto-diagnosis.

Conclusion: ECGTwin demonstrates potential for precise personalized healthcare by effectively generating condition-specific ECG digital twins.

Abstract: Personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) generation is to simulate a patient's
ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions. It has the potential to
transform traditional healthcare into a more accurate individualized paradigm,
while preserving the key benefits of conventional population-level ECG
synthesis. However, this promising task presents two fundamental challenges:
extracting individual features without ground truth and injecting various types
of conditions without confusing generative model. In this paper, we present
ECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the
first stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning
robustly captures personal features from a reference ECG. In the second stage,
the extracted individual features, along with a target cardiac condition, are
integrated into the diffusion-based generation process through our novel AdaX
Condition Injector, which injects these signals via two dedicated and
specialized pathways. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have
demonstrated that our model can not only generate ECG signals of high fidelity
and diversity by offering a fine-grained generation controllability, but also
preserving individual-specific features. Furthermore, ECGTwin shows the
potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis in downstream application, confirming
the possibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions.

Motivation: To forecast NCAA tournament results using advanced deep learning, leveraging historical data and feature engineering for robust predictions.

Method: Implemented LSTM and Transformer models with feature engineering (GLM metrics, Elo ratings, seed differences, box-score stats). Evaluated using BCE and Brier loss functions.

Result: Transformer with BCE had highest AUC (0.8473), while LSTM with Brier loss showed best calibration (Brier score 0.1589).

Conclusion: Choice of model and loss function depends on task needs; the pipeline offers a reproducible framework for sports analytics.

Abstract: In this research, I explore advanced deep learning methodologies to forecast
the outcomes of the 2025 NCAA Division 1 Men's and Women's Basketball
tournaments. Leveraging historical NCAA game data, I implement two
sophisticated sequence-based models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Transformer architectures. The predictive power of these models is augmented
through comprehensive feature engineering, including team quality metrics
derived from Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Elo ratings, seed differences,
and aggregated box-score statistics. To evaluate the robustness and reliability
of predictions, I train each model variant using both Binary Cross-Entropy
(BCE) and Brier loss functions, providing insights into classification
performance and probability calibration. My comparative analysis reveals that
while the Transformer architecture optimized with BCE yields superior
discriminative power (highest AUC of 0.8473), the LSTM model trained with Brier
loss demonstrates superior probabilistic calibration (lowest Brier score of
0.1589). These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate
model architectures and loss functions based on the specific requirements of
forecasting tasks. The detailed analytical pipeline presented here serves as a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FeFETs' inherent randomness from cycling and fabrication variability complicates modeling, necessitating accurate variability capture for reliable design and optimization.

Method: The framework uses a Mixture Density Network with C-infinity continuous activation functions and device-specific embedding layers to model variability, enabling synthetic device generation.

Result: The model achieves an R2 of 0.92, accurately capturing FeFET current variability.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, data-driven solution for modeling FeFET stochastic behavior, supporting future compact model development and circuit simulation.

Abstract: FeFETs hold strong potential for advancing memory and logic technologies, but
their inherent randomness arising from both operational cycling and fabrication
variability poses significant challenges for accurate and reliable modeling.
Capturing this variability is critical, as it enables designers to predict
behavior, optimize performance, and ensure reliability and robustness against
variations in manufacturing and operating conditions. Existing deterministic
and machine learning-based compact models often fail to capture the full extent
of this variability or lack the mathematical smoothness required for stable
circuit-level integration. In this work, we present an enhanced probabilistic
modeling framework for FeFETs that addresses these limitations. Building upon a
Mixture Density Network (MDN) foundation, our approach integrates C-infinity
continuous activation functions for smooth, stable learning and a
device-specific embedding layer to capture intrinsic physical variability
across devices. Sampling from the learned embedding distribution enables the
generation of synthetic device instances for variability-aware simulation. With
an R2 of 0.92, the model demonstrates high accuracy in capturing the
variability of FeFET current behavior. Altogether, this framework provides a
scalable, data-driven solution for modeling the full stochastic behavior of
FeFETs and offers a strong foundation for future compact model development and
circuit simulation integration.

Abstract: Large-scale tuberculosis (TB) screening is limited by the high cost and
operational complexity of traditional diagnostics, creating a need for
artificial-intelligence solutions. We propose DeepGB-TB, a non-invasive system
that instantly assigns TB risk scores using only cough audio and basic
demographic data. The model couples a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional

tabular features. Its principal innovation is a Cross-Modal Bidirectional
Cross-Attention module (CM-BCA) that iteratively exchanges salient cues between
modalities, emulating the way clinicians integrate symptoms and risk factors.
To meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a
Tuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on
false-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications.
DeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across
seven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851,
representing a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables
real-time, offline inference directly on common mobile devices, making it ideal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token-level eviction methods fail to adapt to dynamic attention patterns and over-compress marginally important tokens, harming LLM performance.

Method: SmallKV leverages attention similarity between LLMs of different scales to compensate for eviction losses, using a small model to approximate attention scores.

Conclusion: SmallKV is an efficient and performant solution for KV cache compression in resource-constrained LLM inference.

Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource
constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing
token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their
irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns
during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both
marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the
collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal
information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two
compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices
between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted
compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention
matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in
perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller
model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger
model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and
LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency
evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than
baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM
inference in resource constrained environments.

*Haonan Yang,Jianchao Tang,Zhuo Li,Long Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DMSC, a dynamic multi-scale coordination framework for Time Series Forecasting (TSF), addressing static decomposition, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion. It includes EMPD, TIB, and ASR-MoE blocks for adaptive, hierarchical modeling and achieves SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TSF methods struggle with static decomposition, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion, limiting their ability to capture intricate temporal dependencies.

Method: Proposes DMSC with EMPD for dynamic multi-scale patch decomposition, TIB for joint dependency modeling, and ASR-MoE for adaptive fusion. Uses a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture.

Result: DMSC achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior computational efficiency on thirteen real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: DMSC effectively addresses key TSF challenges through dynamic multi-scale coordination, demonstrating robust performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling
intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent
advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures
based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static
decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion
mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To
explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel
Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch
Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale
Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in
component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with
exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints
through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,
inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed
representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a
multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained
representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature
extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically
fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local
experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for
TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

*Dahun Kim,Anelia Angelova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method, Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, enhances vision-language contrastive learning by using multiple adaptive prompts for richer semantic alignment with visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CLIP-style models use a single text embedding, limiting semantic diversity. The proposed method aims to capture diverse semantic aspects for better alignment.

Method: Introduces multiple structured prompts with adaptive tokens, processed jointly. Uses diversity regularization and negation-aware loss to improve contrastive discrimination.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements on image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method enriches semantic representations and enhances alignment between text and visual features.

Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to
enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike
standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method
introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive
token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We process all
prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are
combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer
alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and
representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a
negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving
contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both
image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

*Katherine Avery,Chinmay Pendse,David Jensen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a practical bandit algorithm for distributionally robust evaluation and learning, using structural equation models (SEMs) to tailor uncertainty sets, improving accuracy and reducing variance in policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for distributionally robust evaluation and learning are overly conservative, leading to suboptimal policies and evaluations.

Method: Uses structural equation models (SEMs) to customize uncertainty sets and conditional independence testing to detect shifted variables.

Result: SEM approach provides more accurate evaluations and lower-variance policies, especially for large shifts, and learns optimal policies if the model is well-specified.

Conclusion: The SEM-based method outperforms traditional approaches by reducing conservatism and improving policy learning.

Abstract: Distributionally robust evaluation estimates the worst-case expected return
over an uncertainty set of possible covariate and reward distributions, and
distributionally robust learning finds a policy that maximizes that worst-case
return across that uncertainty set. Unfortunately, current methods for
distributionally robust evaluation and learning create overly conservative
evaluations and policies. In this work, we propose a practical bandit
evaluation and learning algorithm that tailors the uncertainty set to specific
problems using mathematical programs constrained by structural equation models.
Further, we show how conditional independence testing can be used to detect
shifted variables for modeling. We find that the structural equation model
(SEM) approach gives more accurate evaluations and learns lower-variance
policies than traditional approaches, particularly for large shifts. Further,
the SEM approach learns an optimal policy, assuming the model is sufficiently
well-specified.

*Lei Pang,Ruinan Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO is a critic-free RL algorithm for fine-tuning LLMs, replacing PPO's value function with group-normalized rewards. A new variant, TIC GRPO, uses trajectory-level importance ratios for unbiased gradient estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve reinforcement learning for fine-tuning large language models by removing the critic and addressing bias in policy gradient estimates.

Method: GRPO replaces PPO's value function with group-normalized rewards and uses token-level importance sampling. TIC GRPO simplifies this with trajectory-level probability ratios for unbiased gradients.

Result: GRPO performs comparably even without importance sampling. TIC GRPO provides unbiased gradient estimates while retaining critic-free structure.

Conclusion: GRPO and TIC GRPO offer efficient, critic-free alternatives for fine-tuning LLMs, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is
a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language
models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance
sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact
estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.
However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy
between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We
validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is
entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient
estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably,
this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level
Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance
ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased
estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free
structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis
for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed
variant.

*Hanqi Feng,Peng Qiu,Mengchun Zhang,Yiran Tao,You Fan,Jingtao Xu,Barnabas Poczos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A biologically-inspired framework for antibody design using adaptive, physics-based meta-learning with specialized experts, achieving target-specific optimization and improved multi-objective performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing antibody design methods lack adaptability to unique antigen requirements, unlike natural B cell affinity maturation.

Method: Uses multiple specialized experts (e.g., van der Waals, molecular recognition) with online meta-learning to adaptively refine antibodies based on iterative feedback.

Result: Achieves target-specific optimization, preserves molecular symmetries, enhances hotspot coverage, and generalizes across diverse design challenges.

Conclusion: The framework enables precision-focused antibody design by mimicking natural refinement cycles and adapting to individual targets.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for
antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies
that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell
affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective
optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the
first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain
knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple
specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and
interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on
iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of
fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization
strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1)
discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen
classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout
optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality
through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective
optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a
paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its
unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes
effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large
protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual
targets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces defense methods (FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG) against PoisonedRAG attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, showing their effectiveness in filtering adversarial texts while maintaining performance close to original RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems are vulnerable to knowledge poisoning attacks like PoisonedRAG, which compromise knowledge sources to mislead generation models. This work aims to mitigate such attacks.

Method: Proposes FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, leveraging a novel property to differentiate adversarial from clean texts, and uses it to filter out adversarial content.

Result: The methods effectively mitigate PoisonedRAG attacks, achieving performance close to original RAG systems on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed defenses successfully address the vulnerability of RAG systems to knowledge poisoning, enhancing their reliability.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to
boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential
vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise
the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the
PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate
an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose
novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG
attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to
differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source.
Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones
in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using
benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to
those of the original RAG systems.

TL;DR: A resource-efficient framework combining knowledge distillation and particle swarm optimization for automated vulnerability assessment, reducing model size by 99.4% while retaining 89.3% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational and storage demands of large pre-trained models in cybersecurity vulnerability assessment.

Method: Two-stage approach: particle swarm optimization for compact model architecture and knowledge distillation for transferring critical knowledge.

Result: Achieves 99.4% model size reduction, 89.3% accuracy retention, outperforms baselines by 1.7% accuracy with 60% fewer parameters, and reduces training time by 72.1%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for scalable and efficient vulnerability assessment, balancing performance and resource constraints.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in
cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions
for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained
models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational
and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and
particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our
framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is
utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing
computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is
applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large
teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly
reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results
on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability
Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. Our approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while
retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. Furthermore, it outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 1.7% in accuracy with 60% fewer parameters. The
framework also reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by
34.88% compared to traditional genetic algorithms.

*Enrique Luna Villagómez,Vladimir Mahalec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are evaluated for unsupervised fault detection in chemical processes, outperforming conventional methods with higher efficiency and robustness, especially in low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the utility of KANs in unsupervised fault detection, an area where their potential remains largely unexplored, and compare their performance against traditional methods.

Method: Four KAN-based autoencoder variants (EfficientKAN, FastKAN, FourierKAN, WavKAN) are benchmarked against an Orthogonal Autoencoder (OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process, using Fault Detection Rate (FDR) as the metric.

Result: WavKAN-AE achieves the highest FDR (≥92%) with minimal data (4,000 samples), while EfficientKAN-AE shows robustness with only 500 samples. FastKAN-AE performs well at larger scales, and FourierKAN-AE underperforms. OAE requires more data to match KAN-AEs.

Conclusion: KAN-AEs combine data efficiency and strong fault detection, with potential for improved transparency, making them suitable for industrial applications with limited data.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a flexible and
parameter-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks. Unlike
standard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place
learnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.
While they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in
unsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a
comparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised
fault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,
each based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,
FourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder
(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating
data across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault
Detection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest
overall FDR ($\geq$92\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top
performer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.
EfficientKAN-AE reaches $\geq$90\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating
robustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger
scales ($\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.
The OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to
match top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to
combine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of
structured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency,
making them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial
settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid neural-symbolic architecture improves regression accuracy by 10-300x over traditional methods for asymmetric structured noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional least-squares optimization fails under asymmetric structured noise, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: Combines a transformer encoder, compression NN, and fixed symbolic equation to learn symbolic fits via neural parameter estimation.

Result: Achieves median regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5, outperforming least squares and robust regression techniques.

Conclusion: The hybrid architecture effectively handles asymmetric noise, offering significant accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Robust regression techniques rely on least-squares optimization, which works
well for Gaussian noise but fails in the presence of asymmetric structured
noise. We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer
encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic
parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence.
Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original
sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a
symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation. Our model achieves a median
regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, which is a 10-300
times improvement when compared with ordinary least squares fit and robust
regression techniques such as Huber loss or SoftL1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational cost and data curation challenges of pretraining TSFMs on large-scale real-world sequences.

Method: CauKer uses Gaussian Process kernel composition and Structural Causal Models to create causally coherent synthetic time series with realistic features.

Result: CauKer-generated datasets show clear scaling laws for dataset size and model capacity, unlike irregular scaling in real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CauKer enables sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, offering a scalable and practical alternative to real-world data.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant
attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world
applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly
pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world
sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose
CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent
synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear
interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with
Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining
of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and
following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments
reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both
dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters),
unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.

*Alex Massucco,Davide Murari,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for deep neural networks with orthogonal Jacobian matrices, ensuring stable training and competitive performance without relying on skip connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training very deep neural networks is challenging due to vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing solutions like orthogonal initialization and residual architectures help but are limited.

Method: A mathematical framework is developed for feedforward and residual networks with orthogonal Jacobian matrices, enabling perfect dynamical isometry. This includes new designs without skip connections.

Result: Perfect Jacobian orthogonality stabilizes training and matches residual networks' performance. Extended analysis includes networks with partial isometries, maintaining trainability.

Conclusion: The framework provides a general solution for training deep networks efficiently, with potential for broader applications beyond standard architectures.

Abstract: Very deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance by extracting
rich, hierarchical features. Yet, training them via backpropagation is often
hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as
orthogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures,
allow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models.
In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a
broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose
input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere.
Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical
isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not
only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new
designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on
conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect
Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training
and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks
regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable
results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks
well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks
with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are
then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing modeling approaches fail to capture evolving hybrid dynamics in PES, degrading performance on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: PENODE embeds hybrid operating mechanisms as an event automaton and injects known ODE components into neural parameterization, creating a differentiable, trainable architecture.

Result: PENODE achieves higher accuracy in benchmarks with 75% fewer neurons, maintaining interpretability and enabling efficient FPGA deployment.

Conclusion: PENODE enhances real-time control and edge deployment while preserving physical interpretability.

Abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power
Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to
consistently capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in
PES, degrading Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs
(PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton
to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE
components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics.
This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture
that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it
supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental
results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in
benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75%
reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains
physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control
enhancement.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with known clusters, where arms share similar mean rewards. It proposes Clus-UCB, an algorithm exploiting cluster structure to improve regret bounds, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses scenarios like online advertising and clinical trials where outcomes depend on factors with varying influence, leveraging known clustering to enhance decision-making.

Method: The authors derive asymptotic regret lower bounds and propose Clus-UCB, an algorithm using cluster-based indices for arm evaluation, enabling information sharing among arms.

Result: Clus-UCB matches the derived lower bounds asymptotically and outperforms KL-UCB and other algorithms in simulations.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the benefits of exploiting clustering in bandit problems, identifies limitations, and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned
into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ
by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori,
the arm means are unknown. This framework models scenarios where outcomes
depend on multiple factors -- some with significant and others with minor
influence -- such as online advertising, clinical trials, and wireless
communication. We derive asymptotic lower bounds on the regret that improve
upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an
efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically.
Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new
index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In
this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation
results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other
well-known algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some
limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning possible future research.

Motivation: To address the need for accurate and generalizable predictions of fuel consumption and trajectory reachability in low-thrust mission design.

Method: 1. Confirms the Scaling Law for low-thrust trajectory approximation. 2. Constructs a large dataset using the homotopy ray method. 3. Transforms data into a self-similar space for adaptability. 4. Develops neural networks in C++, Python, and MATLAB.

Conclusion: The proposed neural networks are general, accurate, and computationally efficient, suitable for diverse low-thrust mission scenarios.

Abstract: In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two
key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes
general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The
contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation
of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the
largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which
aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are
transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to
arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the
applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission
scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory
approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The
resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting
velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers require heavy computational resources and complex hyperparameter tuning, prompting the need for a more efficient alternative.

objective directly into the transformer pipeline, enabling more efficient
training and improved performance. Across multiple fine-grained text
classification benchmarks, BoostTransformer demonstrates both faster
convergence and higher accuracy, surpassing standard transformers while
minimizing architectural search overhead.

*Arthur Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GrandJury introduces a dynamic, pluralistic evaluation protocol for generative ML models, addressing the limitations of static benchmarks by incorporating time-decayed aggregation, traceability, and multi-rater human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluation methods for generative ML models rely on static benchmarks, which misalign with dynamic user needs and evolving contexts. GrandJury aims to provide a more flexible and accountable evaluation framework.

Method: The protocol combines time-decayed aggregation, complete traceability, dynamic task rubric attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. It is implemented as an open-source tool (grandjury PyPI package) and includes a public dataset of LLM outputs.

Result: GrandJury enables pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and highlights disagreements, offering a better fit for dynamic real-world applications.

Conclusion: GrandJury presents a new paradigm for evaluating generative ML models in contexts without absolute ground truth, emphasizing adaptability and transparency.

Abstract: Generative Machine Learning models have become central to modern systems,
powering applications in creative writing, summarization, multi-hop reasoning,
and context-aware dialogue. These models underpin large-scale AI assistants,
workflow automation, and autonomous decision-making. In such domains,
acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly
context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static,
benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores
rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury
introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation,
complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric
attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable
pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and
surfaces disagreement. We provide an open-source implementation (grandjury PyPI
package) and a public collection of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
outputs to illustrate the need and method. GrandJury provides a new paradigm
for AI practitioners when evaluating machine learning outputs without absolute
ground truth.

*Minghao Yan,Zhuang Wang,Zhen Jia,Shivaram Venkataraman,Yida Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLoRA improves LoRA fine-tuning efficiency by optimizing concurrent jobs and kernels, reducing makespan by 7.52x and boosting throughput by 12.8x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LoRA training paradigms inefficiently use hardware and incur high overhead for performant adapters.

Method: Proposes PLoRA, which orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs and develops efficient kernels under hardware constraints.

Result: PLoRA reduces makespan by up to 7.52x and increases training throughput by up to 12.8x.

Conclusion: PLoRA significantly enhances LoRA fine-tuning efficiency for LLMs.

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity as a fine-tuning approach
for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its low resource requirements and good
performance. While a plethora of work has investigated improving LoRA serving
efficiency by serving multiple LoRAs concurrently, existing methods assume that
a wide range of LoRA adapters are available for serving. In our work, we
conduct extensive empirical studies to identify that current training paradigms
do not utilize hardware resources efficiently and require high overhead to
obtain a performant LoRA. Leveraging these insights, we propose PLoRA, which
automatically orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs under given
hardware and model constraints and develops performant kernels to improve
training efficiency. Our experimental studies show that PLoRA reduces the
makespan of LoRA fine-tuning over a given hyperparameter search space by up to
7.52x and improves training throughput by up to 12.8x across a range of
state-of-the-art LLMs.

### [82] [Injecting Measurement Information Yields a Fast and Noise-Robust Diffusion-Based Inverse Problem Solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02964)
*Jonathan Patsenker,Henry Li,Myeongseob Ko,Ruoxi Jia,Yuval Kluger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve diffusion models for solving inverse problems by estimating the conditional posterior mean, integrating measurement data directly into the sampling process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for inverse problems rely on Tweedie's formula, which ignores measurement data during the diffusion process, leading to suboptimal integration of information.

Method: The authors estimate the conditional posterior mean using a lightweight maximum likelihood estimation, integrating it into standard samplers for efficiency.

Result: The proposed method shows comparable or better performance than contemporary solvers across various datasets and tasks, with robustness to measurement noise.

Conclusion: The approach enhances diffusion models for inverse problems by directly incorporating measurement data, improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers
for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior
and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's
formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior
mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the
diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample
$\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the
measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this
work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E}
[\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the
solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation
problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler,
resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is
amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to
measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved
performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across
multiple datasets and tasks.

TL;DR: A novel method for varied-density clustering in high-dimensional data using label propagation in adaptive neighborhood graphs, combining density-based clustering with graph connectivity for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of clustering high-dimensional data with varying densities by leveraging graph-based techniques for scalability and accuracy.

Method: Frames clustering as label propagation in density-adaptive neighborhood graphs, uses density-aware neighborhood propagation, and employs random projection for approximate graph construction.

Result: Significantly reduces computational cost, scales to millions of data points in minutes, and maintains competitive clustering accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges density-based clustering with graph connectivity, offering a scalable and accurate solution for high-dimensional data.

Abstract: We propose a novel perspective on varied-density clustering for
high-dimensional data by framing it as a label propagation process in
neighborhood graphs that adapt to local density variations. Our method formally
connects density-based clustering with graph connectivity, enabling the use of
efficient graph propagation techniques developed in network science. To ensure
scalability, we introduce a density-aware neighborhood propagation algorithm
and leverage advanced random projection methods to construct approximate
neighborhood graphs. Our approach significantly reduces computational cost
while preserving clustering quality. Empirically, it scales to datasets with
millions of points in minutes and achieves competitive accuracy compared to
existing baselines.

TL;DR: DFedCAD is a framework for decentralized federated learning that reduces communication costs and improves adaptation for delayed clients using Centroid-Aligned Distillation and Weighted Cluster Pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address slow adaptation of late-joining clients and high communication costs in decentralized federated learning.

Method: Uses Weighted Cluster Pruning (WCP) to compress models into centroids and a novel structural distance metric with differentiable k-means distillation for knowledge transfer.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet while reducing communication overhead by over 86%.

Conclusion: DFedCAD offers a scalable and efficient solution for decentralized learning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) struggles with the slow adaptation of
late-joining delayed clients and high communication costs in asynchronous
environments. These limitations significantly hinder overall performance. To
address this, we propose DFedCAD, a novel framework for rapid adaptation via
Centroid-Aligned Distillation. DFedCAD first employs Weighted Cluster Pruning
(WCP) to compress models into representative centroids, drastically reducing
communication overhead. It then enables delayed clients to intelligently weigh
and align with peer knowledge using a novel structural distance metric and a
differentiable k-means distillation module, facilitating efficient end-to-end
knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet show that DFedCAD consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance, attaining the highest accuracy across all evaluated settings while
reducing communication overhead by over 86%. Our framework provides a scalable
and practical solution for efficient decentralized learning in dynamic,
real-world scenarios.

### [85] [Where and How to Enhance: Discovering Bit-Width Contribution for Mixed Precision Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03002)
*Haidong Kang,Lianbo Ma,Guo Yu,Shangce Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method to improve bit-width selection in mixed precision quantization, outperforming gradient-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-based MPQ methods assume quantization parameter values reflect bit-width contributions, but this may not hold. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: SMPQ uses Shapley values to measure bit-width contributions directly, with Monte Carlo sampling for efficient computation.

Result: SMPQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks compared to gradient-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SMPQ method effectively improves bit-width selection in MPQ, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Mixed precision quantization (MPQ) is an effective quantization approach to
achieve accuracy-complexity trade-off of neural network, through assigning
different bit-widths to network activations and weights in each layer. The
typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e.,
bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable
(DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization
parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed
precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of
quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy
improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the
bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this
problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not
necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task
performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures
the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce
computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is
proposed for Shapley computation. Extensive experiments on mainstream
benchmarks demonstrate that our SMPQ consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance than gradient-based competitors.

### [86] [Urban In-Context Learning: Bridging Pretraining and Inference through Masked Diffusion for Urban Profiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03042)
*Ruixing Zhang,Bo Wang,Tongyu Zhu,Leilei Sun,Weifeng Lv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Urban In-Context Learning, a one-stage framework for urban profiling that unifies pretraining and inference using masked autoencoding and diffusion modeling, outperforming traditional two-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing urban profiling methods rely on a two-stage paradigm (representation learning + linear probing), which is inefficient. The paper aims to unify pretraining and inference, inspired by GPT-style models, despite urban data's structural differences from language.

Method: Proposes Urban In-Context Learning, a masked autoencoding framework, and the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer for probabilistic predictions. Also introduces the Urban Representation Alignment Mechanism to stabilize training.

Result: The one-stage method outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage approaches on three indicators across two cities, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of diffusion modeling.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully unifies pretraining and inference for urban profiling, demonstrating superior performance and validating the utility of diffusion modeling and alignment mechanisms.

Abstract: Urban profiling aims to predict urban profiles in unknown regions and plays a
critical role in economic and social censuses. Existing approaches typically
follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;
second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates
from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent
studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow
models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the
need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the
form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban
data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from
language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both
pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,
a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding
process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we
introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s
prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic
value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban
Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate
features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods.
Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that
our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage
approaches. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the
effectiveness of each proposed module, particularly the use of diffusion
modeling.

### [87] [A Novel Multimodal Framework for Early Detection of Alzheimers Disease Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03046)
*Tatwadarshi P Nagarhalli,Sanket Patil,Vishal Pande,Uday Aswalekar,Prafulla Patil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel multimodal framework combining MRI, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers improves early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection using CNNs and LSTMs, outperforming traditional single-modality methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early AD diagnosis is challenging due to limitations of single-modality methods, delaying treatment and worsening outcomes.

Method: Integrates MRI (analyzed via CNN), cognitive tests, and biomarkers (processed via LSTM), using weighted averaging for robust results even with incomplete data.

Result: The framework enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability, enabling early AD detection before clinical symptoms appear.

Conclusion: This multimodal approach could revolutionize AD diagnosis, enabling earlier interventions and better treatment outcomes.

Abstract: Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
poses significant challenges in its early diagnosis, often leading to delayed
treatment and poorer outcomes for patients. Traditional diagnostic methods,
typically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the
multifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from
three primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This
framework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and
biomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by
aggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques
like weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not
only improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the
identification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage
over conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is
particularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of
clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially
altering the course of the disease. This research demonstrates that the
proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of
AD, paving the way for more timely and effective treatments

TL;DR: VRPO, a value-centric framework, improves RLHF robustness by enhancing the value model's noise-filtering and key-word attention, outperforming PPO and GRPO in noisy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address noisy or imperfect reward supervision in RLHF, which undermines policy stability and generalization, by focusing on the value model's role.

Method: Proposes VRPO with an auxiliary loss (guided by entropy and perplexity) and a variational information bottleneck to filter noise and improve advantage estimation.

Result: VRPO outperforms PPO and GRPO baselines in math reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue under noisy rewards.

Conclusion: Highlights the value model's importance in RLHF and provides a practical approach for robust policy optimization in noisy environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or
imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy
stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on
key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward
denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the
value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value
model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and
enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric
framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two
core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a
frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These
mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture
key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a
passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math
reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and
model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO
baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value
model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy
optimization in noisy real-world environments.

*Sukruta Prakash Midigeshi,Tanmay Goyal,Gaurav Sinha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and RS-MNL, for multinomial logistic bandits with limited policy updates, achieving optimal regret and practical efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing real-world challenges, the paper focuses on developing algorithms with limited adaptivity (only M policy updates) for multinomial logistic bandits.

Method: Two algorithms are proposed: B-MNL-CB (batched setting) and RS-MNL (rarely-switching setting), extending distributional optimal designs and adapting to adversarial contexts, respectively.

Result: B-MNL-CB achieves ~O(√T) regret with stochastic contexts and Ω(log log T) updates, while RS-MNL achieves ~O(√T) regret with ~O(log T) updates for adversarial contexts. Experiments show competitiveness with state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The algorithms demonstrate practical applicability and efficiency, often outperforming baselines with fewer policy updates, making them suitable for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multinomial Logistic Bandits have recently attracted much attention due to
their ability to model problems with multiple outcomes. In this setting, each
decision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial
logit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have
simultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,
motivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop
algorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy
updates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and
RS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,
respectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update
rounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can
choose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first
algorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the
multinomial setting and achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the
contexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\Omega(\log \log T)$
update rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated
contexts and can achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$
policy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our
algorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive
(and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their
policy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various
practical scenarios.

*Mengting Pan,Fan Li,Xiaoyang Wang,Wenjie Zhang,Xuemin Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiTeC introduces a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework for text-attributed hypergraphs, addressing limitations of prior methods by incorporating semantic-aware augmentations and multi-scale contrastive loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior contrastive learning methods for hypergraphs overlook textual information, introduce noise via random augmentations, and fail to capture long-range dependencies, limiting representation quality.

Method: HiTeC uses a two-stage approach: (1) pre-training a structure-aware text encoder, and (2) employing semantic-aware augmentations and multi-scale contrastive loss (including subgraph-level contrast).

Result: HiTeC outperforms existing methods, demonstrating scalability and improved representation quality.

Conclusion: HiTeC effectively addresses the limitations of prior work, offering a scalable and high-quality solution for self-supervised learning on text-attributed hypergraphs.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised
hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels.
However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich
textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying
existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to
three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders
overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,
resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data
augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The
primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the
ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive
representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its
co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,
we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework
with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised
learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a
structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of
conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware
augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and
semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing
objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture
long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph
contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without
compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of HiTeC.

*Yuichi Kondo,Hideaki Iiduka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Lyapunov function to analyze SGDM's convergence under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules, revealing a hierarchy in convergence behavior and practical benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the convergence analysis of SGDM and unify the analysis across dynamic schedules, addressing gaps in existing theoretical frameworks.

Method: A new Lyapunov function is introduced to analyze SGDM under three dynamic scheduling strategies: (i) constant batch size with decaying learning rate, (ii) increasing batch size with decaying learning rate, and (iii) increasing batch size with increasing learning rate.

Result: Strategy (i) fails to guarantee convergence, while (ii) and (iii) do, with (iii) achieving faster decay. Empirical results confirm dynamic SGDM outperforms fixed baselines, and warm-up schedules excel.

Conclusion: The study provides a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for efficient and stable deep learning training.

Abstract: We analyze the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent with
momentum (SGDM) under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules by
introducing a novel Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function has a simpler
structure compared with existing ones, facilitating the challenging convergence
analysis of SGDM and a unified analysis across various dynamic schedules.
Specifically, we extend the theoretical framework to cover three practical
scheduling strategies commonly used in deep learning: (i) constant batch size
with a decaying learning rate, (ii) increasing batch size with a decaying
learning rate, and (iii) increasing batch size with an increasing learning
rate. Our theoretical results reveal a clear hierarchy in convergence behavior:
while (i) does not guarantee convergence of the expected gradient norm, both
(ii) and (iii) do. Moreover, (iii) achieves a provably faster decay rate than
(i) and (ii), demonstrating theoretical acceleration even in the presence of
momentum. Empirical results validate our theory, showing that dynamically
scheduled SGDM significantly outperforms fixed-hyperparameter baselines in
convergence speed. We also evaluated a warm-up schedule in experiments, which
empirically outperformed all other strategies in convergence behavior. These
findings provide a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for
designing efficient and stable training procedures in modern deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel OOD detection framework using pseudo-label-induced subspace representation improves ID-OOD separability under relaxed assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods rely on restrictive feature space assumptions, limiting separability between ID and OOD samples.

Method: Proposes a pseudo-label-induced subspace representation and a learning criterion combining cross-entropy loss with subspace distance regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework enhances OOD detection by relaxing assumptions and improving separability.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies at the heart of robust artificial
intelligence (AI), aiming to identify samples from novel distributions beyond
the training set. Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as
distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods
rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the
separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we
propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced
subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions
compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a
simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based
ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to
enhance ID-OOD separability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Graph Neural Network framework is introduced to approximate Graph Edit Distance (GED) with supervised and unsupervised training, improving adaptability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GED computation is NP-hard, and existing NN-based methods often assume unrealistic unit-cost edit operations. This work addresses these limitations.

Method: The framework uses a Graph Neural Network with a Generalized Additive Model for context-aware edit costs, enabling unsupervised training via a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism.

Result: The method matches state-of-the-art performance while enhancing adaptability and interpretability, particularly in domains like molecular analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively approximates GED with flexible, interpretable cost functions, offering practical value in real-world applications.

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of
one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the
dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation
is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation
methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these
NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit
operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this
work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED
using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting,
it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization
without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture
is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible
and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results
show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art
reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and
interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into
complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as
molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

*The-Hai Nguyen,Dang Huu-Tien,Takeshi Suzuki,Le-Minh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RegMean++ improves upon RegMean by incorporating intra- and cross-layer dependencies, outperforming it in various settings and achieving competitive or state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RegMean merges linear layers independently, ignoring feature propagation and its impact on predictions. RegMean++ addresses this limitation.

Method: RegMean++ extends RegMean by explicitly including intra- and cross-layer dependencies in the merging objective.

Result: RegMean++ consistently outperforms RegMean in ID/OOD generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: RegMean++ is a superior alternative to RegMean, offering better performance and capturing merge model behaviors more effectively.

Abstract: Regression Mean (RegMean), an approach that formulates model merging as a
linear regression problem, aims to find the optimal weights for each linear
layer in the merge model by minimizing the discrepancy in predictions between
the merge and candidate models. RegMean provides a precise closed-form solution
for the merging problem; therefore, it offers explainability and computational
efficiency. However, RegMean merges each linear layer independently,
overlooking how the features and information in the earlier layers propagate
through the layers and influence the final prediction in the merge model. In
this paper, we introduce RegMean++, a simple yet effective alternative to
RegMean, that explicitly incorporates both intra- and cross-layer dependencies
between merge models' layers into RegMean's objective. By accounting for these
dependencies, RegMean++ better captures the behaviors of the merge model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RegMean++ consistently outperforms
RegMean across diverse settings, including in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness
under several types of distribution shifts. Furthermore, RegMean++ achieves

*Yicheng Feng,Xin Tan,Kin Hang Sew,Yimin Jiang,Yibo Zhu,Hong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Frontier is a high-fidelity simulator designed for complex LLM inference, supporting Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and disaggregated architectures, addressing limitations of existing simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulators fail to capture the dynamics of emerging LLM paradigms like MoE and disaggregated architectures, necessitating a new tool.

Method: Frontier provides a unified framework for modeling co-located and disaggregated systems, with native MoE support, expert parallelism, and advanced workflows like cross-cluster expert routing.

Result: Frontier enables accurate simulation of complex LLM inference workflows, improving design and optimization capabilities.

Conclusion: Frontier empowers the community to advance LLM inference by offering a high-fidelity, versatile simulation tool.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is growing increasingly complex with the
rise of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and disaggregated architectures that
decouple components like prefill/decode (PD) or attention/FFN (AF) for
heterogeneous scaling. Existing simulators, architected for co-located, dense
models, are unable to capture the intricate system dynamics of these emerging
paradigms. We present Frontier, a high-fidelity simulator designed from the
ground up for this new landscape. Frontier introduces a unified framework to
model both co-located and disaggregated systems, providing native support for
MoE inference with expert parallelism (EP). It enables the simulation of
complex workflows like cross-cluster expert routing and advanced pipelining
strategies for latency hiding. To ensure fidelity and usability, Frontier
incorporates refined operator models for improved accuracy. Frontier empowers
the community to design and optimize the future of LLM inference at scale.

### [96] [Estimating Worst-Case Frontier Risks of Open-Weight LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03153)
*Eric Wallace,Olivia Watkins,Miles Wang,Kai Chen,Chris Koch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the risks of releasing GPT-OSS by testing its capabilities in biology and cybersecurity through malicious fine-tuning (MFT). Results show it underperforms closed-weight models and marginally improves open-weight models, leading to its release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the worst-case risks of releasing GPT-OSS by evaluating its capabilities in high-risk domains like biology and cybersecurity.

Method: Malicious fine-tuning (MFT) is used to maximize GPT-OSS's capabilities in biology (threat creation) and cybersecurity (CTF challenges). Performance is compared against open- and closed-weight LLMs.

Result: MFT GPT-OSS underperforms closed-weight models (e.g., OpenAI o3) and marginally improves open-weight models, not significantly advancing frontier risks.

Conclusion: The findings supported the decision to release GPT-OSS, and the MFT approach is proposed as a tool for evaluating risks in future open-weight model releases.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss.
We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum
capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two
domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we
curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment
with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an
agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We
compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk
evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss
underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability
level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss
may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially
advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision
to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful
guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

*Paul Gümmer,Julian Rosenberger,Mathias Kraus,Patrick Zschech,Nico Hambauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage clustering approach improves house price valuation by balancing interpretability and performance, outperforming non-clustered models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of interpretability in black-box models and the oversimplification of linear regression for heterogeneous markets.

Method: Two-stage clustering (location-based first, then additional features) followed by modeling each cluster with LR or GAM.

Result: 36% improvement for GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error; cluster-specific insights revealed.

Conclusion: Cluster-specific modeling enhances interpretability and practical valuation reliability for stakeholders.

Abstract: House price valuation remains challenging due to localized market variations.
Existing approaches often rely on black-box machine learning models, which lack
interpretability, or simplistic methods like linear regression (LR), which fail
to capture market heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a machine learning
approach that applies two-stage clustering, first grouping properties based on
minimal location-based features before incorporating additional features. Each
cluster is then modeled using either LR or a generalized additive model (GAM),
balancing predictive performance with interpretability. Constructing and
evaluating our models on 43,309 German house property listings from 2023, we
achieve a 36% improvement for the GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error
compared to models without clustering. Additionally, graphical analyses unveil
pattern shifts between clusters. These findings emphasize the importance of
cluster-specific insights, enhancing interpretability and offering practical
value for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts seeking more reliable
property valuations.

### [98] [Rethinking Selectivity in State Space Models: A Minimal Predictive Sufficiency Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03158)
*Yiyi Wang,Jian'an Zhang,Hongyi Duan,Haoyang Liu,Qingyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency to address the heuristic design of selective mechanisms in State Space Models (SSMs), proposing the MPS-SSM framework for improved performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a rigorous theoretical foundation for selective mechanisms in SSMs raises concerns about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.

Method: The authors propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space Model (MPS-SSM), where the selective mechanism is derived from an information-theoretic criterion, optimizing predictive power while compressing historical information.

Result: MPS-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy scenarios, and demonstrates superior robustness.

Conclusion: The MPS principle not only enhances SSMs but can also be extended as a general regularization framework for other architectures, showing broad potential.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly recent selective variants like Mamba,
have emerged as a leading architecture for sequence modeling, challenging the
dominance of Transformers. However, the success of these state-of-the-art
models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which
lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises
questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.
To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel
information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should
be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based
on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space
Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by
optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach
encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without
losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and
spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy
scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the
MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance
other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential.

*Jueon Park,Yein Park,Minju Song,Soyon Park,Donghyeon Lee,Seungheun Baek,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoTox is a novel framework combining LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning for interpretable multi-toxicity prediction, outperforming traditional models and enhancing drug safety assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug toxicity prediction is limited by reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability in current models, hindering organ-specific toxicity understanding.

Method: CoTox integrates chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology terms using LLMs (like GPT-4o) for step-by-step reasoning, with IUPAC names for better chemical representation.

Result: CoTox outperforms traditional ML and deep learning models, improves reasoning with IUPAC names, and aligns predictions with physiological responses in case studies.

Conclusion: LLM-based frameworks like CoTox enhance interpretability and support early-stage drug safety assessment, with practical utility demonstrated in drug development.

Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent
machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their
reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their
applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities
driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual
data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.
To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM
with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox
combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)
terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step
reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional
machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance
across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we
find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier
for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and
improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug
development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and
incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This
approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with
physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the
potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support
early-stage drug safety assessment. The code and prompt used in this work are

*Lasse Bohlen,Sven Kruschel,Julian Rosenberger,Patrick Zschech,Mathias Kraus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study replicates the effect of adjustable ML predictions on reducing algorithm aversion and examines if interpretability (transparency) further reduces aversion. Results confirm adjustability's impact but find transparency's effect smaller and non-significant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether interpretable ML models can reduce algorithm aversion further or make adjustability unnecessary, building on prior work where users lacked model reasoning insights.

Method: Conceptual replication of a prior study on adjustable predictions, extended with an interpretable ML model showing decision logic. A pre-registered user study with 280 participants tested transparency and adjustability's effects.

Result: Adjustability reduced algorithm aversion as expected, but transparency's impact was smaller and not significant. Effects of transparency and adjustability were more independent than anticipated.

Conclusion: Adjustability remains effective in reducing algorithm aversion, while interpretability's role is less clear and may not replace adjustability.

Abstract: Previous work has shown that allowing users to adjust a machine learning (ML)
model's predictions can reduce aversion to imperfect algorithmic decisions.
However, these results were obtained in situations where users had no
information about the model's reasoning. Thus, it remains unclear whether
interpretable ML models could further reduce algorithm aversion or even render
adjustability obsolete. In this paper, we conceptually replicate a well-known
study that examines the effect of adjustable predictions on algorithm aversion
and extend it by introducing an interpretable ML model that visually reveals
its decision logic. Through a pre-registered user study with 280 participants,
we investigate how transparency interacts with adjustability in reducing
aversion to algorithmic decision-making. Our results replicate the
adjustability effect, showing that allowing users to modify algorithmic
predictions mitigates aversion. Transparency's impact appears smaller than
expected and was not significant for our sample. Furthermore, the effects of
transparency and adjustability appear to be more independent than expected.

TL;DR: A novel ML architecture using quantum spectral methods for interpretable signal analysis and symbolic reasoning, avoiding traditional deep learning drawbacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a transparent, data-efficient, and physically grounded alternative to conventional neural networks by leveraging spectral methods and symbolic reasoning.

Method: Uses Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm to transform signals into sparse spectral representations, enabling symbolic reasoning via kernel projection and rule-based inference.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy in anomaly detection, symbolic classification, and hybrid reasoning while maintaining interpretability and data efficiency.

Conclusion: Proposes a promising direction for physically-informed, reasoning-capable ML, bridging spectral methods and symbolic AI.

Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning architecture that departs from
conventional neural network paradigms by leveraging quantum spectral methods,
specifically Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm, for interpretable
signal analysis and symbolic reasoning. The core innovation of our approach
lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse,
physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of
backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box
models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant
structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel
projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning
engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation
theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and
physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full
mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular
algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through
comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic
classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this
spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining
interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for
physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.

*Qi Lv,Lei Geng,Ziqiang Cao,Min Cao,Sujian Li,Wenjie Li,Guohong Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AS-Softmax improves training efficiency and performance by focusing on strong opponents and using adaptive gradient accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax's unreachable target score leads to overfitting and inefficiency. AS-Softmax aims to align training with test goals and optimize learning.

Method: AS-Softmax discards low-score classes during training and uses adaptive gradient accumulation for speedup.

Result: AS-Softmax outperforms softmax variants across tasks, with 1.2x training speedup and better validation correlation.

Conclusion: AS-Softmax is a superior alternative to softmax, enhancing efficiency and performance in classification tasks.

Abstract: Softmax with the cross entropy loss is the standard configuration for current
neural classification models. The gold score for a target class is supposed to
be 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes
the training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the
"target-approach-1" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all
samples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already
been classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply
requires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve
the above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which
designs a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For
more purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores
compared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on
learning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is
also the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of
easy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive
gradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up
training. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,
text multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio
classification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show
that AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss
of AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in
validation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring
about 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while
maintaining classification effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews the application of scaling laws in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), focusing on data, network, and training budget scaling to enhance performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of scaling laws in deep learning for vision and NLP, their potential in DRL for decision-making remains underexplored. This review aims to bridge that gap.

Method: Systematically analyzes scaling strategies in three dimensions: data (parallel sampling, data generation), network (architectural enhancements, ensemble methods), and training budget (distributed training, large batch sizes).

Result: Identifies synergistic roles of scaling strategies in advancing DRL, balancing scalability with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the potential of scaling to unlock DRL's full potential in tasks like robot control and autonomous driving.

Abstract: In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has
driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision
and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept
of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training
data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed
breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and
advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its
potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for
decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by
systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,
and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data
efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the
relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we
investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,
ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which
collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational
challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of
distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary
training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these
strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in
advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future
research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with
computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging
scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot
control, autonomous driving and LLM training.

Motivation: To improve understanding and performance of diffusion models by analyzing errors in discretization, initialization, and score estimation.

Method: Introduces a framework to analyze errors and derives Wasserstein convergence bounds for Heun and Euler samplers.

Result: Improved bounds for Euler sampler and first-time bounds for Heun sampler, highlighting the role of score function regularity.

Conclusion: Spatial regularity of the learned score function is crucial, and controlling score error aligns with denoising score matching.

Abstract: We provide new convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance for
diffusion-based generative models, covering both stochastic (DDPM-like) and
deterministic (DDIM-like) sampling methods. We introduce a simple framework to
analyze discretization, initialization, and score estimation errors. Notably,
we derive the first Wasserstein convergence bound for the Heun sampler and
improve existing results for the Euler sampler of the probability flow ODE. Our
analysis emphasizes the importance of spatial regularity of the learned score
function and argues for controlling the score error with respect to the true
reverse process, in line with denoising score matching. We also incorporate
recent results on smoothed Wasserstein distances to sharpen initialization
error bounds.

TL;DR: The paper explores information propagation in finite-width neural networks, revealing a fractal boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes, and extends findings to convolutional networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how input correlations evolve in practical, finite-size neural networks, beyond mean-field theory assumptions.

Method: Analyzes information propagation in randomly initialized finite-width networks and uses Fourier-based structured transforms for convolutional networks.

Result: The boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes is fractal, showing complexity independent of input data and optimization.

Conclusion: Finite network depth is crucial for balancing separation and robustness in neural networks.

Abstract: Information propagation characterizes how input correlations evolve across
layers in deep neural networks. This framework has been well studied using
mean-field theory, which assumes infinitely wide networks. However, these
assumptions break down for practical, finite-size networks. In this work, we
study information propagation in randomly initialized neural networks with
finite width and reveal that the boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes
exhibits a fractal structure. This shows the fundamental complexity of neural
network dynamics, in a setting that is independent of input data and
optimization. To extend this analysis beyond multilayer perceptrons, we
leverage recently introduced Fourier-based structured transforms, and show that
information propagation in convolutional neural networks also follow the same
behavior. Our investigation highlights the importance of finite network depth
with respect to the tradeoff between separation and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of rigorous statistical guarantees and computational inefficiency in existing MU methods, driven by data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

Method: Proposes a new MU definition using Conformal Prediction (CP), formalizes conformal criteria, and introduces metrics (ECF and EuCF) to measure unlearning effectiveness. A practical method optimizes these metrics.

Result: Demonstrates efficacy in removing targeted data across diverse scenarios, datasets, and models.

Conclusion: The CP-based MU approach provides statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees and practical unlearning effectiveness.

Abstract: The increasing demand for data privacy, driven by regulations such as GDPR
and CCPA, has made Machine Unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence
of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving
performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous
statistical guarantees, rely on heuristic metrics, and often require
computationally expensive retraining baselines. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce a new definition for MU based on Conformal Prediction (CP),
providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need
for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize conformal criteria that
quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose
empirical metrics,the Efficiently Covered Frequency (ECF at c) and its
complement, the Efficiently Uncovered Frequency (EuCF at d), to measure the
effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method
designed to optimize these conformal metrics. Extensive experiments across
diverse forgetting scenarios, datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach in removing targeted data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HALO is a new auto-bidding system for RTB that addresses inefficiencies in traditional methods by using hindsight learning and B-spline representation for robust adaptation to diverse advertiser constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional auto-bidding solutions struggle with sample inefficiency and poor generalization under varying budget-ROI constraints due to advertiser heterogeneity.

Method: HALO introduces a hindsight mechanism to repurpose exploration data and uses B-spline functional representation for continuous bid mapping.

Result: Evaluations show HALO outperforms traditional methods, reducing constraint violations and improving GMV.

Conclusion: HALO provides a robust solution for multi-constraint bidding in RTB, handling diverse advertiser requirements effectively.

Abstract: Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through
Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions
through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience
targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser
heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across
advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity
creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).
Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical
flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific
constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,
and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical
relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we
propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO
introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all
explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via
trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional
representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across
constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI
requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale
constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of interpretability in black-box deep learning methods for time series classification, especially in safety-critical applications.

Method: Proposes a novel STL-inspired kernel to map time series to predefined STL formulae, jointly optimizing for accuracy and interpretability.

Result: Competitive performance with high-quality logical justifications for model decisions, offering both local and global explanations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies classification and explanation, making model decisions transparent and grounded in human-interpretable patterns.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation
through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time
series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly
optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied
by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables
classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces
both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive
performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model
decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize alpha-beta divergences for complex vectors, bridging gaps in existing literature and enabling broader applications in signal processing.

Method: Extends alpha-beta divergences to complex vectors, ensuring compatibility with Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances, and derives closed-form centroid solutions.

Result: A novel formulation for complex data, with hyperparameters enabling classical divergence extensions and interpretable centroid roles.

Conclusion: The work provides a flexible tool for complex data in signal processing, with potential wide applicability due to its adaptability and interpretability.

Abstract: Divergences are fundamental to the information criteria that underpin most
signal processing algorithms. The alpha-beta family of divergences, designed
for non-negative data, offers a versatile framework that parameterizes and
continuously interpolates several separable divergences found in existing
literature. This work extends the definition of alpha-beta divergences to
accommodate complex data, specifically when the arguments of the divergence are
complex vectors. This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by
setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the
well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of
hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of
several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a
complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean
distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on
the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters. These contributions may
have wide potential applicability, as there are many signal processing domains
in which the underlying data are inherently complex.

*Yubo Wang,Shimin Di,Zhili Wang,Haoyang Li,Fei Teng,Hao Xin,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models' performance stems from their base KGE model or extension modules. By decomposing HKGs into KGs, it finds some KGE models match HKGE performance. It identifies topology and information loss issues in decomposition and proposes FormerGNN, a framework improving HKGE by preserving topology and capturing long-range dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify if HKGE models' superiority comes from their base KGE model or extension modules, and to address limitations in current HKGE models like topology alteration and information loss.

Method: Decompose HKGs into KGs using three methods, evaluate classical KGE models, and propose FormerGNN with a qualifier integrator and GNN-based encoder.

Result: Some KGE models perform comparably to HKGE models. Decomposition alters HKG topology and loses information. FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

Conclusion: FormerGNN addresses current HKGE limitations, offering a direction for future research by preserving topology and improving information integration.

Abstract: Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an
extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world
facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to
adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing
extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the
superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their
base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this
paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods
and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our
results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of
HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods
alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.
Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in
capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate
main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.
To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE
research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a
qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based
graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an
improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to
mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that
FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

*Giovanni Donghi,Luca Pasa,Daniele Zambon,Cesare Alippi,Nicolò Navarin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a framework for online continual learning on graphs, addressing efficiency and evaluation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graphs evolve over time, requiring timely predictions, but current methods lack alignment with online continual learning (OCL) on graphs.

Method: Introduces a general formulation for OCL on graphs, focusing on batch processing efficiency and systematic evaluation.

Result: Benchmarks and evaluates adapted CL methods, providing performance insights.

Conclusion: The work defines OCL on graphs, offers benchmarks, and adapts existing methods, advancing the field.

Abstract: The aim of Continual Learning (CL) is to learn new tasks incrementally while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically
focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting
distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs
exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming
setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely
and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with
the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of
online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general
formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency
requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a
well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a
set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL
literature, adapted to our setting.

### [112] [Strategic Hypothesis Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03289)
*Safwan Hossain,Yatong Chen,Yiling Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores hypothesis testing in a principal-agent setup, analyzing how a strategic agent's behavior influences the principal's choice of a p-value threshold to balance errors. It provides a game-theoretic model and empirical validation using drug approval data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how strategic behavior of agents (e.g., in drug approvals) affects the principal's hypothesis testing decisions, balancing false positives and negatives.

Method: Develops a game-theoretic model to analyze agent behavior and principal's statistical decision rules, validated with empirical data on drug approvals.

Result: The principal's errors show monotonic behavior with a critical p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable optimal threshold. Empirical data supports the model.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into strategic interactions in hypothesis testing, with implications for technical and regulatory decision-making.

Abstract: We examine hypothesis testing within a principal-agent framework, where a
strategic agent, holding private beliefs about the effectiveness of a product,
submits data to a principal who decides on approval. The principal employs a
hypothesis testing rule, aiming to pick a p-value threshold that balances false
positives and false negatives while anticipating the agent's incentive to
maximize expected profitability. Building on prior work, we develop a
game-theoretic model that captures how the agent's participation and reporting
behavior respond to the principal's statistical decision rule. Despite the
complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit
clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical
p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their
optimal p-value threshold. We empirically validate our model and these insights
using publicly available data on drug approvals. Overall, our work offers a
comprehensive perspective on strategic interactions within the hypothesis
testing framework, providing technical and regulatory insights.

*Svenja Ehlers,Merten Stender,Norbert Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework is proposed to reconstruct ocean wave fields from sparse measurements without ground truth data, using physics-based constraints for accurate, real-time predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of predicting phase-resolved ocean wave fields due to lack of practical data assimilation methods and the infeasibility of obtaining large labeled datasets in real-world scenarios.

Method: Embedding residuals of free surface boundary conditions into the loss function of PINO to constrain solutions without ground truth data.

Result: Accurate reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from sparse measurements (buoy time series and radar snapshots), validated with synthetic data.

Conclusion: PINO enables robust, real-time wave reconstruction and prediction, advancing operational data-driven solutions for marine environments.

Abstract: Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a
critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of
practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from
sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep
learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled
datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in
real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially
and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse
measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is
achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of
ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the
solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using
highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate
reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar
snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time
reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions,
thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and
prediction in realistic marine environments.

### [114] [Software Fairness Dilemma: Is Bias Mitigation a Zero-Sum Game?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03323)
*Zhenpeng Chen,Xinyue Li,Jie M. Zhang,Weisong Sun,Ying Xiao,Tianlin Li,Yiling Lou,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates bias mitigation methods for tabular data, finding a zero-sum trade-off between privileged and unprivileged groups, and explores an alternative approach to avoid this trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in ML is crucial, but bias mitigation often leads to leveling-down effects. This study investigates if such effects apply to tabular data tasks and explores better solutions.

Method: Evaluated eight bias mitigation methods across 44 tasks using five real-world datasets and four ML models. Also tested a targeted approach for unprivileged groups.

Result: Found a zero-sum trade-off, unlike leveling-down effects in other domains. The targeted approach showed potential to benefit unprivileged groups without harming privileged ones or overall performance.

Conclusion: The study suggests pathways for fairness improvements without zero-sum trade-offs, aiding broader adoption of bias mitigation methods.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical requirement for Machine Learning (ML) software,
driving the development of numerous bias mitigation methods. Previous research
has identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision
and natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering
performance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,
it remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular
data tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world
applications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular
data, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks
using five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier
findings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,
where improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for
traditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the
perception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of
fairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that
applies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged
groups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without
negatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance. Our study
highlights potential pathways for achieving fairness improvements without
zero-sum trade-offs, which could help advance the adoption of bias mitigation
methods.

TL;DR: LieQ is a metric-driven post-training quantization framework for sub-7B models, achieving state-of-the-art compression-accuracy trade-offs at extreme low-bit precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are over-provisioned, with many layers contributing little unique information but dominating memory and energy use during inference.

Method: LieQ introduces three layer-wise diagnostics (Perplexity Drop, Representational Compactness, Top-k Energy Gain) for automatic bit-width allocation without gradient updates.

Result: On Qwen3-4B, LieQ recovers 95.9% of FP16 performance at 2.05-bit precision, outperforming GPTQ and AWQ. On LLaMA3.2-3B, it maintains 98.2% accuracy at 2.07-bit with 4x memory reduction.

Conclusion: LieQ sets new paradigms for deploying small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Large language models with billions of parameters are often over-provisioned:
many layers contribute little unique information yet dominate the memory and
energy footprint during inference. We present LieQ, a metric-driven
post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of
maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our
method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop,
Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical
division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation
without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe
accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art
compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16
baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and
AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to
LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision
while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying
small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

*N. Marrani,T. Hageman,E. Martínez-Pañeda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning-based method using multi-Neural Networks (NNs) is introduced to predict hydrogen trapping parameters from TDS spectra, addressing challenges in traditional indirect methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS) methods for characterizing hydrogen trapping in metallic alloys are indirect and challenging for extracting key parameters like trap binding energies and densities.

Method: A multi-NN model is developed, with one NN for classifying trap types and another for regression to predict trap densities and binding energies, trained on synthetic data.

Result: The model showed strong predictive performance when tested on three tempered martensitic steels with varying compositions.

Conclusion: The proposed machine learning approach effectively addresses limitations of traditional TDS methods, with the code made freely available.

Abstract: The hydrogen trapping behaviour of metallic alloys is generally characterised
using Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). However, as an indirect method,
extracting key parameters (trap binding energies and densities) remains a
significant challenge. To address these limitations, this work introduces a
machine learning-based scheme for parameter identification from TDS spectra. A
multi-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on
synthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data.
The model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained
with backpropagation. The first network (classification model) predicts the
number of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then
predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN
architectures, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing were optimised to
minimise the amount of training data. The proposed model demonstrated strong
predictive capabilities when applied to three tempered martensitic steels of
different compositions. The code developed is freely provided.

TL;DR: AI on the Pulse is an anomaly detection system for real-time patient monitoring using wearable sensors and AI, outperforming 12 SoTA methods with a 22% F1 score improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable continuous, personalized health monitoring without impractical labeling or clinical-grade equipment.

Method: Uses UniTS, a universal time-series model, for anomaly detection and integrates LLMs for interpretability.

Result: Outperforms 12 SoTA methods, works with consumer wearables, and is deployed in real-world settings (@HOME).

Conclusion: Proves effective for non-invasive, high-quality health monitoring and provides actionable insights for healthcare.

Abstract: We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system
that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient
intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art
(SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each
patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle
deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods
that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our
approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for
reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly
detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical
devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score.
However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been
successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By
operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system
proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade
equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs,
translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare
professionals.

*Atabey Ünlü,Phil Rohr,Ahmet Celebi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical agent framework automates molecular optimization, improving binding affinity by 31% in multi-agent setups, while single agents excel in drug-like properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate drug discovery by addressing scattered data, expertise, and tools, enabling faster design cycles.

Method: A multi-agent system with specialized roles (e.g., AI Expert, Medicinal Chemist) automates molecular optimization, using large language models (LLMs) and docking tools.

Result: Multi-agent setups improved binding affinity by 31%, while single agents produced better drug-like properties. Unguided LLMs lacked transparency.

Conclusion: Agent frameworks with provenance tracking enhance molecular design, suggesting further integration of ADMET and selectivity predictors for workflow improvement.

Abstract: Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are
scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical,
tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal
Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target
information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to
molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a
docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic
polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full
reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise
provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule
centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in
context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein
using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking
score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then
compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three
configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an
architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding
optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast,
single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the
cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet
their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning
paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback
loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for
molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and
selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the
discovery pipeline.

TL;DR: The paper applies RL to multi-turn interactions in LLMs, improving success rates in software engineering tasks using a modified DAPO algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL applications in LLMs focus on single-turn tasks, lacking feedback-rich multi-turn interactions common in real-world domains like software engineering.

Method: A modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm is used to train a Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct agent for software engineering tasks.

Result: Success rate on SWE-bench Verified improved from 20% to 39%, outperforming models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

Conclusion: The approach offers a viable path for building autonomous agents for complex real-world problems using open models.

Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language
Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as
mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can
be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate
case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This
contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),
which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that
responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this
general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)
algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world
software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to
39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches
or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward
building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based
on open models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLA-MORL is a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework for dynamic GPU/CPU allocation in cloud ML workloads, reducing training time, costs, and SLA violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in balancing training time, costs, and SLA compliance in cloud ML workloads, with traditional methods leading to inefficiencies or violations.

Method: Uses adaptive multi-objective RL with intelligent initialization and dynamic weight adaptation, featuring a 21D state representation and actor-critic network.

Result: Achieves 67.2% faster training for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8% cost reduction, and 73.4% better SLA compliance vs. static baselines.

Conclusion: SLA-MORL effectively balances performance, cost, and reliability in cloud ML resource management.

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation for machine learning workloads in cloud
environments remains challenging due to competing objectives of minimizing
training time and operational costs while meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA)
constraints. Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or
single-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource
waste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning
framework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on
user-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA
compliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent
initialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that
eliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,
and (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization
priorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a
self-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state
representation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA
compliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation
decisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML
workloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL
achieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%
reduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in
overall SLA compliance compared to static baselines. By addressing both
cold-start inefficiency and dynamic adaptation challenges, SLA-MORL provides a
practical solution for cloud resource management that balances performance,
cost, and reliability in modern ML training environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA) improves parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) by using a mixture of Kronecker products, enhancing expressiveness and hardware efficiency while reducing trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current low-rank adapters in PEFT lack expressiveness due to rank constraints, limiting performance on complex tasks.

Method: MoKA models weight updates as a mixture of Kronecker products with a gating mechanism for importance measurement, enabling rank flexibility and hardware-efficient computations.

Result: MoKA outperforms PEFT baselines, reduces trainable parameters by up to 27x, and achieves state-of-the-art performance-parameter efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: MoKA offers a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs, balancing performance and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the
computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family
adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while
maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness
due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks.
We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker
adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture
of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that
measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive
adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better
trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware
efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix
operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct
extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks
using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not
only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable
parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance
and parameter efficiency.

TL;DR: VRPRM introduces visual reasoning into PRMs, achieving better performance with fewer data annotations compared to traditional PRMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of PRMs lacking long-term reasoning and high annotation costs for CoT-PRM data.

Method: Proposes VRPRM with a two-stage training strategy using minimal CoT-PRM and non-CoT PRM data.

Result: VRPRM outperforms non-thinking PRMs with 118% relative improvement, using only 3.6K CoT-PRM and 50K non-CoT data.

Conclusion: VRPRM provides a cost-effective paradigm for PRM training with enhanced reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large
Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the
reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term
reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few
works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the
annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in
various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process
reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training
strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and
50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a
total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up
to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that
the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning
capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for
PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

TL;DR: Horus is a robust Federated Learning framework using low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) to mitigate poisoning attacks in hyper-heterogeneous settings. It focuses on aggregating stable LoRA components and employs a poisoning score to filter malicious clients, achieving superior robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning (FL) is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, especially in hyper-heterogeneous environments where clients vary in data, communication, and models. High-dimensional models further exacerbate the attack surface.

Method: Horus uses low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) inserted into stable layers, aggregating only LoRAs to reduce attack surface. It leverages the stability of LoRA-A (input projection) to design a poisoning score and a projection-aware aggregation mechanism for benign clients.

Result: Horus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness and accuracy across diverse datasets, model architectures, and attacks.

Conclusion: Horus effectively addresses FL vulnerabilities in hyper-heterogeneous settings by focusing on stable LoRA components and robust aggregation, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) remains highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks,
especially under real-world hyper-heterogeneity, where clients differ
significantly in data distributions, communication capabilities, and model
architectures. Such heterogeneity not only undermines the effectiveness of
aggregation strategies but also makes attacks more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, high-dimensional models expand the attack surface. To address
these challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL
framework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). Rather than aggregating
full model parameters, Horus inserts LoRAs into empirically stable layers and
aggregates only LoRAs to reduce the attack surface.We uncover a key empirical
observation that the input projection (LoRA-A) is markedly more stable than the
output projection (LoRA-B) under heterogeneity and poisoning. Leveraging this,
we design a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score using the features from
LoRA-A to filter poisoned clients. For the remaining benign clients, we propose
projection-aware aggregation mechanism to preserve collaborative signals while
suppressing drifts, which reweights client updates by consistency with the
global directions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attacks demonstrate that Horus consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both robustness and accuracy.

TL;DR: DeepFaith is a unified, model-agnostic XAI framework that optimizes faithfulness across multiple metrics, providing a theoretical ground truth for explanations. It outperforms baselines on diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing XAI methods lack a unified ground truth for evaluating and optimizing explanations due to the absence of an optimal explanation standard.

Method: DeepFaith unifies multiple faithfulness metrics into an optimal explanation objective, leveraging existing methods to train a faithful explainer via pattern consistency and local correlation.

Result: DeepFaith achieves the highest faithfulness across 10 metrics on 12 diverse tasks, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: DeepFaith provides a unified, theoretically grounded framework for generating highly faithful explanations, advancing the field of XAI.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust in complex systems through model
attribution methods that reveal the decision rationale. However, due to the
absence of a unified optimal explanation, existing XAI methods lack a ground
truth for objective evaluation and optimization. To address this issue, we
propose Deep architecture-based Faith explainer (DeepFaith), a domain-free and
model-agnostic unified explanation framework under the lens of faithfulness. By
establishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated
faithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution
simultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby
providing a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer
learning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods,
applies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised
explanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local
correlation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate
highly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing
the model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models
and 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10
metrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and
cross-domain generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of gradient variance in stochastic sampling for VAEs, which slows convergence and degrades performance.

Method: Uses specific decoder architectures to compute the expected ELBO analytically, introducing a zero-variance gradient. Includes a training dynamic for practical use with complex decoders.

Result: Demonstrates superiority over existing estimators in controlled settings and improves performance of baselines across datasets.

Conclusion: Introduces a stable, effective method for training generative models by combining analytical computation with deep architectures.

Abstract: Training deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is often
hindered by the need to backpropagate gradients through the stochastic sampling
of their latent variables, a process that inherently introduces estimation
variance, which can slow convergence and degrade performance. In this paper, we
propose a new perspective that sidesteps this problem, which we call Silent
Gradients. Instead of improving stochastic estimators, we leverage specific
decoder architectures to analytically compute the expected ELBO, yielding a
gradient with zero variance. We first provide a theoretical foundation for this
method and demonstrate its superiority over existing estimators in a controlled
setting with a linear decoder. To generalize our approach for practical use
with complex, expressive decoders, we introduce a novel training dynamic that
uses the exact, zero-variance gradient to guide the early stages of encoder
training before annealing to a standard stochastic estimator. Our experiments
show that this technique consistently improves the performance of established
baselines, including reparameterization, Gumbel-Softmax, and REINFORCE, across
multiple datasets. This work opens a new direction for training generative
models by combining the stability of analytical computation with the
expressiveness of deep, nonlinear architecture.

*Adib Hasan,Mardavij Roozbehani,Munther Dahleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VITA, a variational pretraining framework, improves crop yield forecasting by addressing data asymmetry, outperforming existing models, especially in extreme weather conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate crop yield forecasting is crucial for food security, but current AI models underperform when yields deviate from historical trends due to data asymmetry.

Method: VITA uses detailed weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and self-supervised feature masking, enabling fine-tuning with basic weather data.

Result: VITA achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields, with significant improvements during extreme weather years.

Conclusion: VITA demonstrates how domain-aware AI can overcome data limitations, supporting resilient agricultural forecasting in a changing climate.

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security.
However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from
historical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a
major asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data
available for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer
for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this
asymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed
weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict
rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows
the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during
deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all
evaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under
normal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme
weather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p
\approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN
using less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in
data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can
overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a
changing climate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SolarSeer, an AI model, offers faster and more accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts than traditional NWP methods, reducing errors significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate solar irradiance forecasting is crucial for solar PV systems, but traditional NWP models are computationally expensive.

Method: SolarSeer maps historical satellite data directly to forecasts, bypassing data assimilation and PDEs, making it 1,500x faster than NWP.

Result: SolarSeer reduces forecasting errors by 27.28% in reanalysis and 15.35% at stations, outperforming HRRR.

Conclusion: SolarSeer's speed and accuracy support sustainable energy systems, marking a significant advancement in solar forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the safe and
economic operation of solar photovoltaic systems. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting
performance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving
complicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric
physics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial
intelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous
United States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical
satellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational
overhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows
SolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating
24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer
resolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the
CONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly
reduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%
in reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively
captures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the
first-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,
accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the
transition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.

*Bhavesh Neekhra,Debayan Gupta,Partha Pratim Chakravarti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feature selection (FS) in high-dimensional datasets, like gene expression, may not improve model performance; random feature subsets often perform comparably or better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the effectiveness of FS algorithms by comparing them against randomly selected features.

Method: Testing the null hypothesis of using randomly selected features against FS-selected features in classification tasks.

Result: Random feature subsets (0.02%-1%) perform comparably to FS-selected features, challenging the utility of FS in genomics.

Conclusion: FS may not be useful for high-dimensional datasets, raising concerns about studies relying on computationally selected genes without lab validation.

Abstract: Extensive research has been done on feature selection (FS) algorithms for
high-dimensional datasets aiming to improve model performance, reduce
computational cost and identify features of interest. We test the null
hypothesis of using randomly selected features to compare against features
selected by FS algorithms to validate the performance of the latter. Our
results show that FS on high-dimensional datasets (in particular gene
expression) in classification tasks is not useful. We find that (1) models
trained on small subsets (0.02%-1% of all features) of randomly selected
features almost always perform comparably to those trained on all features, and
(2) a "typical"- sized random subset provides comparable or superior
performance to that of top-k features selected in various published studies.
Thus, our work challenges many feature selection results on high dimensional
datasets, particularly in computational genomics. It raises serious concerns
about studies that propose drug design or targeted interventions based on
computationally selected genes, without further validation in a wet lab.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Goedel-Prover-V2 is a state-of-the-art open-source language model for automated theorem proving, outperforming larger models with innovations like scaffolded data synthesis, verifier-guided self-correction, and model averaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance automated theorem proving by creating efficient, smaller models that outperform larger competitors.

Method: Uses expert iteration and reinforcement learning with scaffolded data synthesis, verifier-guided self-correction, and model averaging.

Result: Goedel-Prover-V2-8B achieves 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F, while the flagship 32B model reaches 90.4% in self-correction mode, surpassing prior SOTA.

Conclusion: Goedel-Prover-V2 sets a new benchmark for open-source theorem provers, offering superior performance with smaller model sizes and compute budgets.

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover-V2, a series of open-source language models that
set a new state-of-the-art in automated theorem proving. Built on the standard
expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic
tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly
complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to
iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler;
(3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in
model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model,
Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our
flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in
standard mode and 90.4% in self-correction mode, outperforming prior SOTA by a
large margin. Additionally, our flagship model solves 86 problems on
PutnamBench at pass@184, securing the first place among open-source models on
the leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B's record of solving 47
problems by pass@1024 with a significantly smaller model size and compute
budget. At the time of its release (July-August 2025), Goedel-Prover-V2
achieves the strongest overall performance among all open-source theorem
provers. It also ranks among the top-performing models--including closed-source
systems with publicly reported performance--under a constrained test-time
compute budget. Our models, code, and data are released at

*Coşku Can Horuz,Sebastian Otte,Martin V. Butz,Matthias Karlbauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU combine convolutional spatial modeling with efficient parallel training, outperforming traditional ConvRNNs in speed and accuracy for spatiotemporal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity by improving training efficiency and reducing bottlenecks in conventional ConvRNN models.

Method: Extends log-domain prefix-sum formulation to convolutional architectures, incorporating exponential gating for simplified computation.

Result: Faster training and lower prediction errors compared to standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs in tasks like Navier-Stokes dynamics and geopotential data.

Conclusion: Minimal recurrent structures with convolutional input aggregation provide an efficient and effective alternative for spatiotemporal modeling.

Abstract: We introduce MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU, two novel spatiotemporal models that
combine the spatial inductive biases of convolutional recurrent networks with
the training efficiency of minimal, parallelizable RNNs. Our approach extends
the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional
architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized
spatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates
during teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In
addition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM
architecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain
computation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient,
with reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models
on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world
geopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly
outperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve
lower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive
mode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when
combined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient
alternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between
recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Pair Correlation Factor (PCF) to better understand the sample complexity of learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), showing it outperforms the minimum pairwise separation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work tied GMM sample complexity to minimum pairwise separation, but this is incomplete. The study aims to identify a more accurate geometric measure.

Method: Introduces the PCF, a geometric quantity capturing component mean clustering, and provides an algorithm for uniform spherical GMMs with improved sample complexity bounds.

Result: The PCF more accurately dictates parameter recovery difficulty, and the algorithm shows cases where more than the usual $\epsilon^{-2}$ samples are needed.

Conclusion: The PCF is a better metric for GMM sample complexity, improving upon the minimum gap and enabling more efficient learning in certain cases.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and ask:
which structural properties govern their sample complexity? Prior work has
largely tied this complexity to the minimum pairwise separation between
components, but we demonstrate this view is incomplete.
  We introduce the \emph{Pair Correlation Factor} (PCF), a geometric quantity
capturing the clustering of component means. Unlike the minimum gap, the PCF
more accurately dictates the difficulty of parameter recovery.
  In the uniform spherical case, we give an algorithm with improved sample
complexity bounds, showing when more than the usual $\epsilon^{-2}$ samples are
necessary.

*Xuyang Zhao,Hidenori Sugano,Toshihisa Tanaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to fine-tune a pretrained model with patient-specific weights improves seizure onset zone (SOZ) classification accuracy by over 10% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of identifying SOZ in focal epilepsy due to reliance on expert judgment and variability in patient data distributions (cross-patient problem).

Method: Supervised learning trains a model, then patient-specific weights are derived from feature similarities to fine-tune the model for each new patient.

Result: Improved classification accuracy for each test patient, averaging over 10% better performance.

Conclusion: Patient-specific fine-tuning enhances machine learning reliability for SOZ identification in epilepsy.

Abstract: Identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with focal epilepsy is
essential for surgical treatment and remains challenging due to its dependence
on visual judgment by clinical experts. The development of machine learning can
assist in diagnosis and has made promising progress. However, unlike data in
other fields, medical data is usually collected from individual patients, and
each patient has different illnesses, physical conditions, and medical
histories, which leads to differences in the distribution of each patient's
data. This makes it difficult for a machine learning model to achieve
consistently reliable performance in every new patient dataset, which we refer
to as the "cross-patient problem." In this paper, we propose a method to
fine-tune a pretrained model using patient-specific weights for every new test
patient to improve diagnostic performance. First, the supervised learning
method is used to train a machine learning model. Next, using the intermediate
features of the trained model obtained through the test patient data, the
similarity between the test patient data and each training patient's data is
defined to determine the weight of each training patient to be used in the
following fine-tuning. Finally, we fine-tune all parameters in the pretrained
model with training data and patient weights. In the experiment, the
leave-one-patient-out method is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the
results show improved classification accuracy for every test patient, with an
average improvement of more than 10%.

TL;DR: The paper explores how structural constraints in deep networks affect the compatibility of internal representations across architectures, showing that such constraints enhance stability and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural choices impact the alignment and transferability of learned representations in deep networks.

Method: Develops a framework combining theoretical insights, empirical probes, and transfer experiments to analyze representational alignment across architectures with structural constraints.

Result: Structural regularities lead to more stable representational geometry under architectural variation, improving feature interoperability.

Conclusion: Inductive biases enhance not only generalization within models but also cross-model feature transferability, with implications for model distillation and robust system design.

Abstract: The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to
architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability,
alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this
paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping
operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal
representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from
prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a
framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across
networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination
of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments,
we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry
that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain
forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but
also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We
conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational
transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled
design of robust learning systems.

*Deepak Pandita,Flip Korn,Chris Welty,Christopher M. Homan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the trade-off between the number of items (N) and annotations per item (K) for reliable ML evaluation, finding optimal configurations for fixed budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility in ML evaluations is crucial but often ignores human disagreement due to budget constraints. This study investigates how to balance N and K for reliable results.

Method: Analyzed categorical datasets with multiple annotations and simulated distributions to determine optimal (N, K) configurations for fixed budgets.

Result: Accounting for human disagreement requires N × K ≤ 1000, often with K > 10. The trade-off depends on the metric, with distribution-sensitive metrics favoring higher K.

Conclusion: The findings guide ML practitioners in optimizing test data collection for reliability within budget constraints.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the
authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning
evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground
truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,
among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has
studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as
is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for
collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more
samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the
per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of
items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable
machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical
datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated
distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$
configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation
data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our
findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N
\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested
on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always
occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and
$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics
that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better
at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get
more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and
annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Morphology-aware policy learning improves sample efficiency but lacks zero-shot performance. Combining it with parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) reduces the need for extensive data collection, achieving better performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the sub-optimal zero-shot performance of morphology-aware policies and reduce computational costs in robotics applications.

Method: Combine morphology-aware pretraining with PEFT techniques (tuning subsets of weights, input adapters, prefix tuning) for online finetuning.

Result: PEFT with pretraining reduces samples needed for policy improvement; tuning <1% of parameters outperforms zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: PEFT techniques enhance morphology-aware policies efficiently, making them practical for robotics with minimal parameter tuning.

Abstract: Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample
efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies
have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb
configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these
policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end
finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in
practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to
perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work,
we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient
finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary
to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare
directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix
tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT
techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the
number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models
end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of
total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot
performance of the base pretrained a policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of verifiable guarantees in LLM outputs despite their fluency.

Method: Adapts DbC and type theory to create a contract layer mediating LLM calls, stipulating semantic and type requirements with probabilistic remediation.

Result: Contracts enable probabilistic satisfaction and semantic validation, treating LLMs as semantic parsers and black-box components.

Conclusion: Proposes that agents satisfying the same contracts are functionally equivalent, emphasizing contract-based equivalence.

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent
outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and
type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM
call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs,
coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance.
The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic
black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic
validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on
well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two
agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with
respect to those contracts.

TL;DR: Language models can self-improve by generating and solving their own questions without external data, using an asymmetric self-play framework called SQLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if language models can enhance reasoning skills autonomously by generating and solving their own questions, eliminating reliance on curated datasets.

Method: Proposes SQLM: an asymmetric self-play framework with a proposer generating questions and a solver answering them, both trained via reinforcement learning. Rewards are based on question difficulty and majority voting for correctness.

Result: Tested on three benchmarks (multiplication, algebra, coding), showing improvement without external data.

Conclusion: Language models can autonomously improve reasoning skills through self-generated questions and solutions.

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating
their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language
model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying
the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its
own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):
an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and
generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer
and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a
reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives
a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of
ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests
which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework
on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the
OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually
generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language
models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated
training datasets.

TL;DR: SkyGP is a streaming framework for Gaussian Processes (GPs) that reduces computational and memory costs while maintaining performance guarantees. It introduces two variants for accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) and efficiency (SkyGP-Fast), validated by benchmarks and real-time experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact GPs face scalability issues in real-time settings due to high computational and memory costs, limiting their use for large datasets.

Method: SkyGP uses a bounded set of experts to address constraints, inheriting GP guarantees. Two variants (SkyGP-Dense, SkyGP-Fast) optimize for accuracy or efficiency.

Result: SkyGP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks and real-time control experiments.

Conclusion: SkyGP provides a scalable, efficient solution for streaming data with GPs, balancing performance and computational constraints.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible
modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function
approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently
incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them
well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid
adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when
processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage
memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time
settings. In this paper, we propose a \underline{s}treaming
\underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\underline{y} generated expert framework
of \underline{G}aussian \underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both
computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts,
while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian
processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a
specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or
improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is
validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments
demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the optimism about LLMs' problem-solving abilities by highlighting a gap in their performance.

Method: Analyzing Yu Tsumura's 554th problem, which meets specific criteria (e.g., IMO-level sophistication, non-combinatorics, fewer proof techniques).

Result: No existing LLM (commercial or open-source) can solve the problem, despite its simplicity and likely presence in training data.

Conclusion: LLMs still have limitations in solving certain mathematical problems, even when they seem well-suited for the task.

Abstract: We show, contrary to the optimism about LLM's problem-solving abilities,
fueled by the recent gold medals that were attained, that a problem exists --
Yu Tsumura's 554th problem -- that a) is within the scope of an IMO problem in
terms of proof sophistication, b) is not a combinatorics problem which has
caused issues for LLMs, c) requires fewer proof techniques than typical hard
IMO problems, d) has a publicly available solution (likely in the training data
of LLMs), and e) that cannot be readily solved by any existing off-the-shelf
LLM (commercial or open-source).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning AI decision-making with human preferences is critical, especially in high-stakes domains like autonomous driving or robotics, where reliability is paramount.

Method: The authors propose PAC-EIG, an acquisition function that maximizes information gain about policy regret, and Reward-EIG for reward-focused objectives, both targeting PAC guarantees.

Result: The method provides theoretical guarantees for active IRL with noisy demonstrations, outperforms prior heuristic approaches, and demonstrates experimental advantages.

Conclusion: PAC-EIG offers a principled solution for active IRL with formal reliability guarantees, advancing the field beyond heuristic methods.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their
decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from
demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice
policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like
autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we
need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal
guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability
guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically
selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce
PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets
probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --
providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert
demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the
apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further
demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the
reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,
we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic
methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.

### [141] [Frequency Point Game Environment for UAVs via Expert Knowledge and Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02757)
*Jingpu Yang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: UAV-FPG is a game-theoretic model for UAV communication, integrating expert knowledge and large language models to improve anti-jamming strategies and path planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in modeling spectrum competition, integrating expert knowledge, and predicting opponent behavior in UAV communication.

Method: Proposes UAV-FPG, a game-theoretic model simulating dynamic interactions between interference and anti-interference strategies, using expert knowledge and large language models for optimization.

Result: Integration of expert knowledge and large language models improves path planning and outperforms fixed-path strategies.

Conclusion: UAV-FPG advances anti-jamming strategies and intelligent decision-making in UAV communication systems.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have made significant advancements in
communication stability and security through techniques such as frequency
hopping, signal spreading, and adaptive interference suppression. However,
challenges remain in modeling spectrum competition, integrating expert
knowledge, and predicting opponent behavior. To address these issues, we
propose UAV-FPG (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - Frequency Point Game), a
game-theoretic environment model that simulates the dynamic interaction between
interference and anti-interference strategies of opponent and ally UAVs in
communication frequency bands. The model incorporates a prior expert knowledge
base to optimize frequency selection and employs large language models for path
planning, simulating a "strong adversary". Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of integrating the expert knowledge base and the large language
model, with the latter significantly improving path planning in dynamic
scenarios through iterative interactions, outperforming fixed-path strategies.
UAV-FPG provides a robust platform for advancing anti-jamming strategies and
intelligent decision-making in UAV communication systems.

### [142] [TransAM: Transformer-Based Agent Modeling for Multi-Agent Systems via Local Trajectory Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02826)
*Conor Wallace,Umer Siddique,Yongcan Cao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A transformer-based agent modeling method, TransAM, is proposed to learn robust policy representations from local trajectories, improving performance in multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent modeling methods often require access to other agents' trajectories, which is impractical. A solution is needed to learn from local trajectories alone.

Method: TransAM uses a transformer-based approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space, capturing other agents' policies effectively.

Result: The method shows strong policy representations, better agent modeling, and higher episodic returns in cooperative, competitive, and mixed environments.

Conclusion: TransAM is a practical and effective solution for agent modeling in multi-agent systems, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Agent modeling is a critical component in developing effective policies
within multi-agent systems, as it enables agents to form beliefs about the
behaviors, intentions, and competencies of others. Many existing approaches
assume access to other agents' episodic trajectories, a condition often
unrealistic in real-world applications. Consequently, a practical agent
modeling approach must learn a robust representation of the policies of the
other agents based only on the local trajectory of the controlled agent. In
this paper, we propose \texttt{TransAM}, a novel transformer-based agent
modeling approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space that
effectively captures the policies of other agents. We evaluate the performance
of the proposed method in cooperative, competitive, and mixed multi-agent
environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach
generates strong policy representations, improves agent modeling, and leads to
higher episodic returns.

*Brennen A. Hill,Mant Koh En Wei,Thangavel Jishnuanandh*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Comparison of learned (LDC) and engineered (Intention Communication) strategies in MARL shows engineered approach outperforms in performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of learned versus engineered communication strategies in cooperative MARL environments.

Method: Introduced LDC (neural network-based) and engineered Intention Communication (ITGM and MGN) for message generation. Tested in fully/partially observable tasks.

Result: Engineered approach (Intention Communication) performed better, especially in complex environments.

Conclusion: Engineered communication strategies are more scalable and effective than learned ones in cooperative MARL.

Abstract: We compare the efficacy of learned versus engineered communication strategies
in a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment. For the
learned approach, we introduce Learned Direct Communication (LDC), where agents
generate messages and actions concurrently via a neural network. Our engineered
approach, Intention Communication, employs an Imagined Trajectory Generation
Module (ITGM) and a Message Generation Network (MGN) to formulate messages
based on predicted future states. Both strategies are evaluated on their
success rates in cooperative tasks under fully and partially observable
conditions. Our findings indicate that while emergent communication is viable,
the engineered approach demonstrates superior performance and scalability,
particularly as environmental complexity increases.

### [144] [Distributionally Robust Markov Games with Average Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03136)
*Zachary Roch,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distributionally robust Markov game (DR-MG) with average rewards for multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty, providing theoretical guarantees and an algorithm for robust Nash Equilibria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address long-term performance in continuous-operation systems under uncertainty, where sustained reliability is critical.

Method: Formulates DR-MG with average rewards, connects multi-agent and single-agent settings, derives solvability of the robust Bellman equation, and proves existence of robust Nash Equilibrium. Develops the robust Nash-Iteration algorithm.

Result: Establishes theoretical guarantees for system stability, proves existence of robust Nash Equilibrium, and connects average-reward NE to discounted NEs.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive foundation for optimal strategies in uncertain, long-running multi-agent environments, enabling future extensions.

Abstract: This paper introduces the formulation of a distributionally robust Markov
game (DR-MG) with average rewards, a crucial framework for multi-agent
decision-making under uncertainty over extended horizons. Unlike finite-horizon
or discounted models, the average-reward criterion naturally captures long-term
performance for systems designed for continuous operation, where sustained
reliability is paramount. We account for uncertainty in transition kernels,
with players aiming to optimize their worst-case average reward. We first
establish a connection between the multi-agent and single agent settings, and
derive the solvability of the robust Bellman equation under the average-reward
formulation. We then rigorously prove the existence of a robust Nash
Equilibrium (NE), offering essential theoretical guarantees for system
stability. We further develop and analyze an algorithm named robust
Nash-Iteration to compute the robust Nash Equilibria among all agents,
providing practical tools for identifying optimal strategies in complex,
uncertain, and long-running multi-player environments. Finally, we demonstrate
the connection between the average-reward NE and the well-studied discounted
NEs, showing that the former can be approximated as the discount factor
approaches one. Together, these contributions provide a comprehensive
theoretical and algorithmic foundation for identifying optimal strategies in
complex, uncertain, and long-running multi-player environments, which allow for
the future extension of robust average-reward single-agent problems to the
multi-agent setting.
