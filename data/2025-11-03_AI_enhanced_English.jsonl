However, current trading agents primarily focus on single-step trading\ntasks and lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we\npropose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic\nmarket. To address this task, we develop a trading agent system, FinPos,\noptimized for position management. FinPos is able to interpret various types of\nmarket information from a professional perspective, providing a reliable basis\nfor positioning decisions. To mitigate the substantial market risks arising\nfrom position fluctuations, FinPos employs dual decision agents. Furthermore,\nthe continuous nature of position management necessitates our adoption of\nmulti-timescale rewards, which in turn empowers FinPos to effectively balance\nshort-term fluctuations against long-term trends. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the\nposition-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More\nimportantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a\nvast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "FinPos is a position-aware trading agent system using LLMs that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by managing continuous positions through dual decision agents and multi-timescale rewards.", "motivation": "Current LLM-based trading agents focus on single-step tasks and lack continuous position management awareness, which doesn't reflect realistic market conditions.", "method": "Developed FinPos system with dual decision agents to interpret market information professionally and employ multi-timescale rewards to balance short-term fluctuations against long-term trends.", "result": "Extensive experiments show FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in position-aware trading tasks that closely mirror real market conditions.", "conclusion": "LLM-centered agent systems have significant unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making, with position-aware approaches being crucial for realistic trading scenarios."}}

However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics\nframeworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering\nlittle to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables\nprivacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks\nsupport for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable\nqueries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates\nLLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical\nmulti-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms\nthem into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first\ndecomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps\neach subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior\nstructural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent\nrewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and\nminimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by\nachieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive\nFA operations by a substantial margin.
