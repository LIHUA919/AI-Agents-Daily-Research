portal that integrates resources of cleaned datasets, code and paper repository
to benefit the community. Finally, we identify limitations in current
methodologies and outline future research opportunities.

*Alexandru-Andrei Avram,Adrian Groza,Alexandru Lecu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent AI system detects disinformation in news articles using relation extraction, achieving high accuracy and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of disinformation on digital platforms threatens information integrity, necessitating robust detection methods.

Method: The system combines four agents: ML (logistic regression), Wikipedia knowledge check (NER), coherence detection (LLM prompt engineering), and web-scraped data analysis (relation extraction). Orchestrated via Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Result: Achieves 95.3% accuracy and F1 score of 0.964, outperforming individual agents and traditional approaches.

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily
scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validated by DRS-BENCH and ablation studies.

Conclusion: AgenticDRS effectively evaluates designs and generates actionable feedback, highlighting an under-explored research direction.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like

holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention

### [6] [Improving and Evaluating Open Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10152)
*Doaa Allabadi,Kyle Bradbury,Jordan M. Malof*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Deep Research Agents (DRAs) on the BrowseComp-Small benchmark, finding 0% accuracy for existing systems. Improvements to an open-source DRA (ODR) yield a 10% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open-source DRAs and evaluate their performance against proprietary systems.

Method: Adapted the BrowseComp benchmark to BC-Small, tested ODR and proprietary systems, and improved ODR to create ODR+.

Result: All initial systems scored 0% accuracy; ODR+ achieved 10%, outperforming others.

Conclusion: Strategic improvements to open-source DRAs can enhance performance, though challenges remain.

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

### [7] [Pruning Long Chain-of-Thought of Large Reasoning Models via Small-Scale Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10164)
*Bin Hong,Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Kai Zhang,Mengdi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Length Controlled Preference Optimization (LCPO) to reduce output length of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) without compromising reasoning quality, achieving over 50% reduction in length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs produce lengthy outputs, increasing computational costs and risking overthinking, while existing methods either sacrifice quality or require excessive resources.

Method: Analyzes generation path distributions, filters trajectories via difficulty estimation, and introduces LCPO under a Bradley-Terry loss framework to balance NLL loss-related rewards.

Result: LCPO reduces average output length by over 50% across benchmarks while maintaining reasoning performance.

Conclusion: LCPO demonstrates the feasibility of computationally efficient approaches for guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

### [8] [KompeteAI: Accelerated Autonomous Multi-Agent System for End-to-End Pipeline Generation for Machine Learning Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10177)
*Stepan Kulibaba,Artem Dzhalilov,Roman Pakhomov,Oleg Svidchenko,Alexander Gasnikov,Aleksei Shpilman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KompeteAI is a novel AutoML framework addressing exploration and execution bottlenecks in LLM-based AutoML systems by introducing dynamic solution space exploration, merging top candidates, and using RAG for idea sourcing. It accelerates pipeline evaluation and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based AutoML systems face limitations like constrained exploration strategies and execution bottlenecks, hindering iterative refinement and diversity in solutions.

Method: KompeteAI employs dynamic solution space exploration, merges top candidates, integrates RAG for sourcing ideas, and uses predictive scoring and accelerated debugging to address bottlenecks.

Result: KompeteAI accelerates pipeline evaluation 6.9 times and outperforms leading methods by 3% on MLE-Bench. It also achieves state-of-the-art results on Kompete-bench.

Conclusion: KompeteAI effectively addresses key challenges in AutoML, offering improved exploration, execution efficiency, and performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI's ability to quantify uncertainty and improve interpretability by leveraging the entropic potential of events, bridging physics and machine learning.

Method: Adapts the entropic potential framework for AI, introducing event-centric measures and conditional expectations for counterfactual scenarios. Formalizes definitions and applies them in reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, and anomaly detection.

Result: The framework provides a unified, interpretable, and versatile approach to uncertainty modeling in AI, with demonstrated applications in diverse areas.

Conclusion: The entropic potential framework is a theoretically grounded and practical tool for managing uncertainty in AI, integrating insights from thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that the perceived 'understanding' and 'reasoning' abilities of LLMs like ChatGPT are illusions due to their inherent limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify misconceptions about LLMs' capabilities and highlight their fundamental inability for true reasoning.

Method: Analyzes the working principles of LLMs to demonstrate their limitations.

Result: Concludes that LLMs cannot achieve true understanding or reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs' reasoning abilities are illusory and fundamentally limited by their design.

Abstract: Recently, with the application progress of AIGC tools based on large language
models (LLMs), led by ChatGPT, many AI experts and more non-professionals are
trumpeting the "understanding ability" and "reasoning ability" of the LLMs. The
present author considers that the so-called "understanding ability" and
"reasoning ability" of LLMs are just illusions of those people who with vague
concepts. In fact, the LLMs can never have the true understanding ability and
true reasoning ability. This paper intents to explain that, because the
essential limitations of their working principle, the LLMs can never have the
ability of true correct reasoning.

### [11] [Promoting Efficient Reasoning with Verifiable Stepwise Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10293)
*Chuhuai Yue,Chengqi Dong,Yinan Gao,Hang He,Jiajun Chai,Guojun Yin,Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a rule-based verifiable stepwise reward mechanism (VSRM) to address overthinking in large reasoning models, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often overthink, wasting computation on simple problems. Existing methods lack flexibility due to preset budgets or mode selection.

Method: Introduces VSRM, assigning rewards based on intermediate reasoning states, integrated with PPO and Reinforce++ for training.

Result: Achieves significant output length reduction while maintaining reasoning performance on benchmarks like AIME24 and AIME25.

Conclusion: VSRM effectively suppresses ineffective steps, alleviating overthinking, and balances efficiency with accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

*Chenliang Zhang,Lin Wang,Yuanyuan Lu,Yusheng Qi,Kexin Wang,Peixu Hou,Wenshi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents solutions for the META CRAG-MM challenge, focusing on multi-modal multi-turn QA. It combines vision-language models, GPT-4 distillation, curriculum learning, and web search APIs to achieve top rankings in tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of building a retrieval-augmented generation system for multi-modal multi-turn question answering, requiring integration of structured data, web search, and context understanding.

Method: Used vision-language models fine-tuned with GPT-4 knowledge, curriculum learning for reinforcement learning, and web search APIs for external knowledge.

Result: Achieved 1st place in Task 1 (52.38% lead) and 3rd in Task 3, showcasing improved accuracy and reduced hallucination.

Conclusion: The integration of curriculum learning with reinforcement learning and external knowledge sources proved effective for complex QA tasks.

Abstract: This paper describes the solutions of the Dianping-Trust-Safety team for the
META CRAG-MM challenge. The challenge requires building a comprehensive
retrieval-augmented generation system capable for multi-modal multi-turn
question answering. The competition consists of three tasks: (1) answering
questions using structured data retrieved from an image-based mock knowledge
graph, (2) synthesizing information from both knowledge graphs and web search
results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context
understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1,
our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by
supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further
applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning,
resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and
Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external
knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn
conversations. Our approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a significant
lead of 52.38\%, and 3rd place in Task 3, demonstrating the effectiveness of

### [13] [Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimisation: A Joint Constraint Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10340)
*Chak Lam Shek,Guangyao Shi,Pratap Tokekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HATRPO-W and HATRPO-G improve MARL by dynamically allocating KL divergence thresholds, outperforming HATRPO with faster convergence and higher rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard HATRPO assigns uniform KL thresholds, leading to suboptimal updates in heterogeneous-agent settings.

Method: Proposes HATRPO-W (KKT-based) and HATRPO-G (greedy) for adaptive KL threshold allocation.

Result: Both methods boost HATRPO performance by over 22.5%, with HATRPO-W showing more stable learning.

Conclusion: Adaptive KL threshold allocation enhances MARL performance and stability in heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

### [14] [What to Ask Next? Probing the Imaginative Reasoning of LLMs with TurtleSoup Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10358)
*Mengtao Zhou,Sifan Wu,Huan Zhang,Qi Sima,Bang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for evaluating imaginative reasoning in LLMs using the 'Turtle Soup' game, including a benchmark, agent, and evaluation protocol. It highlights LLMs' limitations in this area compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs lack dynamic, exploratory reasoning evaluation, prompting the need for a new framework to assess imaginative reasoning.

Method: The study uses 'Turtle Soup' puzzles to create TurtleSoup-Bench, a bilingual benchmark, and Mosaic-Agent to evaluate LLMs. A multi-dimensional protocol measures reasoning quality.

Result: Experiments show LLMs have clear capability limits and common failure patterns, with a significant performance gap compared to humans.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and sets a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

### [15] [LeanRAG: Knowledge-Graph-Based Generation with Semantic Aggregation and Hierarchical Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10391)
*Yaoze Zhang,Rong Wu,Pinlong Cai,Xiaoman Wang,Guohang Yan,Song Mao,Ding Wang,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanRAG improves RAG by addressing disconnected semantic islands and inefficient retrieval in hierarchical knowledge graphs, using semantic aggregation and structure-guided retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge graph-based RAG methods suffer from disconnected high-level summaries and inefficient flat retrieval, limiting effectiveness.

Method: LeanRAG introduces semantic aggregation to form entity clusters and explicit relations, followed by structure-guided retrieval to gather contextually comprehensive evidence.

Result: LeanRAG outperforms existing methods on QA benchmarks, improving response quality and reducing retrieval redundancy by 46%.

Conclusion: LeanRAG effectively addresses key challenges in RAG, enhancing retrieval efficiency and contextual grounding for LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

*Yan Ting Chok,Soyon Park,Seungheun Baek,Hajung Kim,Junhyun Lee,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiRef is a framework for robust medication recommendation by combining hierarchical medical ontologies and refined EHR co-occurrence patterns, improving generalizability to unseen codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in EHR data like rare entities and incomplete records, which hinder generalization in data-driven models.

Method: Combines hierarchical medical ontologies (embedded in hyperbolic space) with refined EHR co-occurrence graphs using sparse regularization.

Result: Achieves strong performance on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV benchmarks and maintains accuracy under unseen-code conditions.

Conclusion: HiRef is resilient to unseen medical codes, validated by ablation studies and analyses of learned structures.

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

TL;DR: We-Math 2.0 enhances MLLMs' mathematical reasoning via a structured knowledge system, model-centric data modeling, and RL-based training, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with complex math reasoning due to gaps in knowledge-driven design and data space modeling.

Method: Integrates a hierarchical knowledge system, dual-dataset (MathBook-Standard & Pro), and a two-stage RL framework (Cold-Start Fine-tuning & Progressive Alignment RL).

Result: Competitive performance on benchmarks and strong results on MathBookEval, indicating improved generalization.

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0 effectively addresses gaps in MLLMs' math reasoning through structured knowledge and RL training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

*Xueli Pan,Victor de Boer,Jacco van Ossenbruggen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FIRESPARQL, a modular framework, improves SPARQL query generation for scholarly knowledge graphs by combining fine-tuned LLMs, RAG, and a query correction layer, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing structural and semantic errors in LLM-generated SPARQL queries for scholarly knowledge graphs due to limited SKG-specific training.

Method: Proposes FIRESPARQL with fine-tuned LLMs, optional RAG, and a SPARQL query correction layer, evaluated on SciQA Benchmark.

Result: Fine-tuning achieves 0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy.

Conclusion: FIRESPARQL effectively enhances SPARQL query generation for scholarly knowledge graphs, with fine-tuning yielding the best performance.

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEQ-GPT, a system using LLMs for Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ) to enhance spatial searches with natural language interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial services lack versatility for complex tasks like searching multiple locations simultaneously. SEQ-GPT aims to improve this using LLMs.

Method: Proposes SEQ-GPT, leveraging LLMs for natural language-based SEQ, with interactive features like query clarification and dynamic adjustments. Includes a pipeline for aligning language with spatial data.

Result: SEQ-GPT demonstrates an end-to-end solution for versatile spatial searches using realistic data and scenarios.

Conclusion: SEQ-GPT enhances spatial search capabilities by integrating LLMs, enabling more interactive and adaptable querying.

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

*Shicheng Xu,Xin Huang,Zihao Wei,Liang Pang,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes DxDirector-7B, an AI-driven LLM that leads full-process clinical diagnosis, reducing physician workload and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-assisted diagnosis lacks the ability to drive the entire diagnostic process from ambiguous complaints, limiting efficiency gains.

Method: Introduces DxDirector-7B, an LLM with deep thinking capabilities, to direct diagnosis with minimal physician input and a clear accountability framework.

Result: DxDirector-7B outperforms state-of-the-art medical and general-purpose LLMs in accuracy and workload reduction across various cases.

Conclusion: The study heralds a shift from AI as an assistant to a primary director in diagnosis, offering a more efficient and accurate solution.

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

### [22] [PASS: Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling for Interpretable and Adaptive Chest X-Ray Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10501)
*Yushi Feng,Junye Du,Yingying Hong,Qifan Wang,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PASS introduces a multimodal framework for Chest X-Ray reasoning, addressing trust, safety, and efficiency issues in agentic systems by sampling interpretable workflows and optimizing performance-cost trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic systems lack trustworthiness, multimodal integration, and efficiency, especially in healthcare tasks like CXR reasoning.

Method: PASS uses probabilistic sampling over a multi-tool graph, personalized memory, and a three-stage training procedure (expert warm-up, contrastive path-ranking, cost-aware RL).

Result: PASS outperforms baselines in accuracy, AUC, and efficiency, validated on the CAB-E benchmark.

Conclusion: PASS advances interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal medical agentic systems, balancing performance and cost.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

### [23] [Diversity First, Quality Later: A Two-Stage Assumption for Language Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10530)
*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effectiveness of on-policy vs. static preference data in LM alignment, proposing a two-stage alignment process (preference injection and fine-tuning) and a method to identify their boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LM alignment by understanding the varying effectiveness of on-policy and static preference data across models and stages.

Method: Proposes the alignment stage assumption, divides alignment into two stages, and develops an algorithm to identify stage boundaries. Tests on 5 models and 2 alignment methods.

Result: On-policy data effectiveness varies (3x for Llama-3, 0.4x for Zephyr). The two-stage assumption is validated across models and methods.

Conclusion: The alignment stage assumption explains effectiveness differences, and the proposed boundary identification method generalizes across models and alignment techniques.

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

### [24] [Improving Value-based Process Verifier via Low-Cost Variance Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10539)
*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ComMCS, a method to reduce variance in value-based process verifiers for LLMs, improving reasoning accuracy without extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving reasoning in LLMs, especially in complex domains like math, is challenging due to estimation errors from limited Monte Carlo samples.

Method: Proposes ComMCS, combining MC estimators from current and subsequent steps to reduce variance while staying unbiased.

Result: ComMCS outperforms baselines by 2.8 and 2.2 points on MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks.

Conclusion: ComMCS effectively reduces variance and enhances reasoning accuracy in LLMs without additional inference cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

*Xinyan Jiang,Lin Zhang,Jiayi Zhang,Qingsong Yang,Guimin Hu,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSRS is a framework for multi-attribute steering in LLMs, reducing interference via orthogonal subspaces and dynamic weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multi-attribute steering, causing interference and trade-offs.

Method: MSRS uses orthogonal subspaces for attributes, hybrid composition, and token-level steering.

Result: MSRS reduces conflicts, outperforms existing methods, and generalizes well.

Conclusion: MSRS enables precise multi-attribute control in LLMs with minimal interference.

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

### [26] [STEP: Stepwise Curriculum Learning for Context-Knowledge Fusion in Conversational Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10669)
*Zhenye Yang,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li,Xiongnan Jin,Xuanyang Li,Junwei Zhang,Hongbo Gao,Kaimin Wei,Senzhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STEP is a conversational recommender system using pre-trained models and curriculum-guided fusion to improve recommendation precision and dialogue quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CRS struggles with deep semantic understanding and integrating external knowledge graphs effectively.

Method: STEP uses a three-stage curriculum for context-KG alignment and dual-prompt tuning for dialogue and recommendation tasks.

Result: Outperforms mainstream methods in recommendation precision and dialogue quality on two datasets.

Conclusion: STEP effectively integrates KG information and improves CRS performance through adaptive prompt tuning.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation to address scalability and sparsity issues in generalized planning using deep RL and GNNs, validated in drone mission scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense graph representations in GNN-based planning lead to combinatorial explosion and sparsity, hindering scalability for large problems.

Method: A sparse, goal-aware GNN selectively encodes local relationships and integrates spatial goal features, tested in PDDL-based drone missions.

Result: The method scales to larger grid sizes, improves policy generalization, and increases success rates compared to dense representations.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical solution for large-scale generalized planning tasks, demonstrated in realistic drone mission simulations.

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MhAIM Dataset to study human responses to AI-generated content, revealing better detection when posts combine text and visuals. It proposes metrics (trustworthiness, impact, openness) and T-Lens, an LLM-based system incorporating human reactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in understanding how AI-generated content influences human perception and behavior, especially in high-stakes domains like trading.

Method: Human-centered approach with the MhAIM Dataset (154,552 posts, 111,153 AI-generated), human studies, and development of T-Lens (LLM-based system with HR-MCP).

Result: People detect AI content better with multimodal posts. T-Lens enhances interpretability by predicting human responses.

Conclusion: The work offers tools and insights to mitigate AI-driven misinformation risks by aligning LLMs with human-awareness capabilities.

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

### [30] [The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10777)
*Maël Jullien,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs perform poorly on clinical trial reasoning tasks despite high accuracy in factual knowledge probes, revealing limitations in structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether scaling data and parameters in LLMs leads to structured, generalizable internal representations, focusing on clinical trial reasoning.

Method: Introduced a Clinical Trial NLI benchmark with four reasoning families and GKMRV probes to dissociate factual access from inference failures. Evaluated six LLMs under direct and chain-of-thought prompting.

Result: Models showed high GKMRV accuracy (0.918) but poor reasoning task performance (0.25), with consistent but incorrect inferences (0.87 consistency).

Conclusion: LLMs lack structured, composable representations for reliable reasoning, despite possessing relevant knowledge. GKMRV probes effectively decouple knowledge from reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for

### [31] [Who Benefits from AI Explanations? Towards Accessible and Interpretable Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10806)
*Maria J. P. Peixoto,Akriti Pandey,Ahsan Zaman,Peter R. Lewis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the lack of accessibility in eXplainable AI (XAI) for users with vision impairments and proposes a four-part method to improve inclusive design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored accessibility gaps in XAI, particularly for vision-impaired users, ensuring equitable interpretability.

Method: A two-pronged approach: literature review of 79 studies and a four-part methodological proof of concept (categorization, persona definition, prototype design, and expert/user assessment).

Result: Simplified explanations are more comprehensible for non-visual users, and multimodal presentation enhances interpretability.

Conclusion: Inclusive XAI design requires addressing accessibility gaps through simplified explanations and multimodal formats.

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

### [32] [OpenFPL: An open-source forecasting method rivaling state-of-the-art Fantasy Premier League services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09992)
*Daniel Groos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpenFPL democratizes high-accuracy Fantasy Premier League forecasts using open-source methods and public data, matching commercial service accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide accessible, accurate player performance forecasts for Fantasy Premier League, currently dominated by undisclosed commercial services.

Method: Develops OpenFPL, an open-source ensemble model using public data (Fantasy Premier League and Understat) from 2020-21 to 2023-24 seasons.

Result: Matches a leading commercial service's accuracy and surpasses it for high-return players (>2 points) across 1-3 gameweek forecasts.

Conclusion: OpenFPL offers a viable, transparent alternative to proprietary forecasts, aiding long-term and final-day decision-making in Fantasy Premier League.

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: xRFM combines feature learning kernel machines with tree structures for tabular data, outperforming 31 methods in regression and competing in classification while offering interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in AI, tabular data inference still relies on GBDTs. Recent interest in neural networks and feature learning methods motivates the development of xRFM.

Method: xRFM integrates feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to adapt to local data structure and scale to large datasets.

Result: xRFM outperforms 31 methods, including TabPFNv2 and GBDTs, in 100 regression datasets and is competitive in 200 classification datasets.

Conclusion: xRFM is a state-of-the-art method for tabular data, combining performance, scalability, and interpretability.

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

TL;DR: The PEARL study tested a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to personalize physical activity nudges via a Fitbit app, showing significant PA increases in the RL group compared to control, random, and fixed groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing global physical inactivity through scalable, personalized mHealth interventions like JITAIs, while overcoming methodological challenges.

Method: A large-scale RCT with 13,463 Fitbit users randomized into control, random, fixed, and RL arms, comparing nudge effectiveness.

Result: The RL group showed significant PA increases at 1 and 2 months, outperforming other groups in daily step counts.

Conclusion: Behaviorally-informed RL can effectively personalize digital health interventions for scalable PA promotion.

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

### [35] [Measuring Time Series Forecast Stability for Demand Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10063)
*Steven Klee,Yuntian Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the importance of forecast stability alongside accuracy in supply chain demand planning, showing ensemble models improve stability without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demand planners prioritize consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements, as unstable forecasts require excessive human intervention and erode trust in ML models.

Method: A case study evaluates stability and accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST, etc.) on M5 and Favorita datasets, focusing on model-induced stochasticity.

Result: Ensemble models enhance stability without significantly degrading (or even improving) forecast accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for further research on forecast stability in production systems, emphasizing its practical importance.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

### [36] [Constrained Decoding of Diffusion LLMs with Context-Free Grammars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10111)
*Niels Mündler,Jasper Dekoninck,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first constrained decoding method for diffusion LLMs, ensuring syntactic correctness for formal languages like C++ and JSON.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to adhere to formal language constraints, limiting their practical use in tasks like code completion and structured data extraction. Existing constrained decoding methods don't work for diffusion LLMs.

Method: The method reduces constrained decoding to the additive infilling problem, solves it for context-free grammars, and ensures efficiency.

Result: Empirical results show near-perfect syntactic correctness and improved functional correctness in tasks like C++ code infilling and JSON data extraction.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of constrained decoding for diffusion LLMs, offering practical efficiency and high correctness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

*Jiulin Li,Ping Huang,Yexin Li,Shuo Chen,Juewen Hu,Ye Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGUS is a modular framework unifying multimodal understanding and generation via decoupled Cognition and Deliberation phases, outperforming state-of-the-art systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of integrating autoregressive language models for reasoning and diffusion models for generation in multimodal applications.

Method: Uses a two-phase approach: Cognition (collaborative dialogue among multimodal LLM agents) and Deliberation (Growth-Aware Search for reasoning and generation).

Result: Outperforms baselines and GPT-4o on benchmarks like MME, supporting scalable any-to-any modality conversion.

Conclusion: MAGUS offers flexible, scalable, and joint-training-free multimodal understanding and generation.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Small LLMs can learn graph tasks via instructive chain-of-thought training, generalizing to new tasks and structures without specialized encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can solve fundamental graph tasks without specialized models and generalize to unseen structures or tasks.

Method: Training small LLMs with instructive chain-of-thought solutions.

Result: LLMs can learn and generalize graph tasks without specialized encoders.

Conclusion: Instructive chain-of-thought training enables LLMs to handle graph tasks effectively.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

TL;DR: CAD-RL is a multimodal reinforcement learning framework for generating CAD modeling code, improving reasoning, precision, and executability over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CAD workflows require expertise and manual effort, and translating human design intent into CAD code is challenging due to logical reasoning, syntax, and precision needs.

Method: Combines Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning with task-specific rewards (executability, geometric accuracy, external evaluation) and optimization strategies (Trust Region Stretch, Precision Token Loss, Overlong Filtering).

Result: CAD-RL outperforms existing methods in reasoning quality, output precision, and code executability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and ExeCAD dataset advance automated CAD modeling by addressing key challenges in code generation.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nested-ReFT introduces a computationally efficient ReFT framework by using a subset of model layers as a behavior model, reducing inference costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ReFT frameworks are computationally expensive due to multiple inference steps, prompting the need for a more efficient alternative.

Method: Nested-ReFT leverages off-policy RL and speculative decoding, using dynamic layer skipping to reduce inference costs during training.

Result: The method improves computational efficiency (tokens/sec) across math reasoning benchmarks and maintains baseline performance with bias mitigation.

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT offers a cost-effective and efficient alternative to standard ReFT, balancing performance and computational savings.

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy for time series models aligns pre-training with Neural Collapse, improving classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pretext tasks for pre-training time series models are heuristic and lack guaranteed transferability to downstream tasks.

Method: Uses rotational equiangular tight frame-classifier, pseudo-labeling, and generative pretext tasks with sequential augmentation.

Result: Outperforms previous methods on LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models across three datasets.

Conclusion: Aligning pre-training with embedding geometry improves performance, validating the proposed strategy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Motivation: To enhance the safety of machine learning systems by providing accurate and explainable OOD detection.

Method: Leverages counterfactual explanations to calculate decision boundary distances and improves scalability by computing counterfactuals in embedding space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 (93.50% AUROC, 25.80% FPR95), CIFAR-100 (97.05% AUROC, 13.79% FPR95), and ImageNet-200 (92.55% AUROC, 33.55% FPR95).

Conclusion: The method effectively detects OOD data while providing interpretability through counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the EM algorithm's behavior in overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR), showing convergence rates and statistical accuracy under different initial mixing weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the EM algorithm's performance under model misspecification, particularly in overspecified 2MLR, addressing challenges like convergence and accuracy.

Method: Theoretical analysis of EM at population and finite-sample levels, focusing on regression parameters and mixing weights, with extensions to low SNR regimes.

Result: Linear convergence in O(log(1/ε)) steps for unbalanced initial weights; sublinear in O(ε⁻²) for balanced. Statistical accuracy varies with mixing weights: O((d/n)¹/²) for unbalanced, O((d/n)¹/⁴) for balanced.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into EM's behavior in overspecified 2MLR, linking population and finite-sample results, and extends findings to low SNR scenarios.

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the role of impactful benchmarks in improving reasoning language models' performance, showing that benchmark-driven selection can enhance generalization beyond just model size or algorithmic improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reasoning language models generalize better through intermediate reasoning steps and the role of benchmarks in their learning process.

Method: The study evaluates the impact of benchmark-driven selection on the DeepSeek-R1 model using a sequential decision-making problem from 'Humanity's Last Exam.'

Result: Better performance is attributed to impactful benchmarks acting as curricula for learning, not just test-time improvements or model size.

Conclusion: Benchmarks can serve as training curricula, and their novelty is crucial for measuring the generalization capabilities of reasoning models.

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

TL;DR: AI-driven analysis of handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks provides a scalable, low-cost forensic tool to link ivory shipments and disrupt trafficking networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transnational ivory trade drives elephant population declines, and existing forensic methods like DNA analysis are costly or unavailable. Handwritten markings on tusks, though easy to photograph, are underutilized.

Method: An AI pipeline was developed to extract and analyze handwritten markings from 6,085 photographs of seized ivory. Object detection and AI tools identified 184 recurring "signature markings," with 20 linking multiple seizures.

Result: The method established forensic links between ivory shipments, connecting traffickers involved in multiple seizures.

Conclusion: AI-based handwriting analysis complements traditional forensic techniques, offering a transformative tool for wildlife crime investigations.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

### [47] [Comparison of D-Wave Quantum Annealing and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Sampling from a Probability Distribution of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10228)
*Abdelmoula El Yazizi,Samee U. Khan,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compares D-Wave quantum annealer and Gibbs sampling for RBM quality, finding limited overlap and potential for combined approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the quality of sampling from RBMs using a local-valley approach, particularly comparing D-Wave quantum annealing and Gibbs sampling.

Method: Applied a local-valley centered approach to compare D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically trained RBM under contrastive-divergence conditions.

Result: D-Wave samples belonged to more LVs but overlapped unfavorably with Gibbs for high-probability states. Some important LVs were unique to each method.

Conclusion: D-Wave sampling alone didn't significantly improve quality, but a combined classical-quantum approach holds potential.

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable machine learning model (LightGBM) was developed to predict early acute kidney injury (AKI) in ICU patients with cirrhosis, achieving high accuracy and actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AKI in cirrhosis patients is common and worsens outcomes, but existing predictive tools lack accuracy and workflow alignment.

Method: Retrospective analysis of MIMIC-IV data, preprocessing, LASSO feature selection, SMOTE balancing, and evaluation of six algorithms.

Result: LightGBM performed best (AUROC 0.808, accuracy 0.704), with key predictors aligning with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms.

Conclusion: The model offers accurate early AKI prediction, supports clinical decision-making, and requires external validation and EHR integration.

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

*Jathin Korrapati,Patrick Mendoza,Aditya Tomar,Abein Abraham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores in-context learning (ICL) for cryptographic function learning, specifically mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigenère ciphers, to evaluate transformer models' generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend ICL beyond simple function classes and test its applicability in structured cryptographic tasks, assessing transformers' inductive biases.

Method: The study uses ICL to condition transformer models on small sets of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, aiming to infer hidden bijective mappings and decode new cipher texts.

Result: The work demonstrates transformers' ability to generalize and infer cryptographic functions purely from context, without parameter updates.

Conclusion: ICL can be effectively applied to cryptographic tasks, showcasing transformers' potential for structured inference challenges.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

*Taibiao Zhao,Mingxuan Sun,Hao Wang,Xiaobing Chen,Xiangwei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HPMI is a retraining-free backdoor attack on transformers, using head-wise pruning and malicious injection, achieving high attack success and bypassing defenses with minimal clean accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, but existing methods are resource-intensive or intrusive. HPMI aims to provide a lightweight, non-intrusive solution.

Method: HPMI prunes the least important head and injects a pre-trained malicious head without retraining or altering architecture.

Result: HPMI achieves 99.55% attack success, negligible clean accuracy loss, and bypasses four advanced defenses.

Conclusion: HPMI is a highly effective, concealable, and robust backdoor attack method for transformers, outperforming retraining-dependent approaches.

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

Motivation: To extend the Max Min framework for approximating functions using exponential neural network operators and investigate their convergence behavior.

Method: Develops Max Min Kantorovich-type operators, studies pointwise and uniform convergence, and uses the logarithmic modulus of continuity to estimate convergence rates. Also examines convergence in Orlicz spaces.

Result: The operators demonstrate effective approximation properties, with convergence rates analyzed and illustrated via graphical representations.

Conclusion: The proposed operators are viable for function approximation, with theoretical and empirical support for their convergence behavior.

Abstract: In this current work, we propose a Max Min approach for approximating
functions using exponential neural network operators. We extend this framework
to develop the Max Min Kantorovich-type exponential neural network operators
and investigate their approximation properties. We study both pointwise and
uniform convergence for univariate functions. To analyze the order of
convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the
corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence
behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and
sigmoidal activation functions.

TL;DR: An adaptive resource orchestration method using multi-agent reinforcement learning improves cloud-native database systems by addressing high resource dynamism and scheduling complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling complexity in cloud-native database systems need efficient solutions.

Method: Proposes a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism with a reward-shaping mechanism to integrate local and global feedback, enhancing coordination and policy convergence.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy convergence speed, stability, and fairness.

Conclusion: The method is effective for large-scale, high-concurrency scheduling tasks, demonstrating strong generalization and practical utility.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

TL;DR: A federated learning-based anomaly detection method for multi-tenant cloud environments ensures data privacy and handles heterogeneous resource behavior by combining local training with global model aggregation and personalized adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and centralized modeling limitations in multi-tenant cloud environments.

Method: Federated training framework with local model training, parameter aggregation, personalized adjustments, and Mahalanobis distance-based anomaly scoring.

Result: Outperforms existing models in Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with robust performance in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The method is practical for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud computing.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud
computing environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a method for adapting to source component shifts in data streams by combining offline decomposition and online mixing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to effectively utilize recurring shifts or capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation.

Method: Offline source component decomposition via EM algorithm and online mixing weight adaptation via convex optimization.

Result: Reduces cumulative test loss by up to 67.4% in experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The method leverages shift characteristics for superior adaptation, validated by significant performance improvements.

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A conformal prediction framework for Parkinson's Disease medication management provides reliable, uncertainty-quantified predictions for levodopa dosing adjustments, improving clinical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PD medication management lacks systematic predictive methods, relying on trial-and-error, which risks inadequate symptom control or side effects due to unquantified uncertainty.

Method: A two-stage conformal prediction framework using EHR data from 631 inpatient admissions to predict medication needs and levodopa dose adjustments with statistical guarantees.

Result: The framework achieved marginal coverage and reduced prediction interval lengths, offering precise short-term and broader long-term forecasts.

Conclusion: Quantifying uncertainty in predictions enables evidence-based levodopa dosing, optimizing symptom control and quality of life while minimizing side effects.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

TL;DR: SynBrain is a generative framework for probabilistic modeling of visual-to-neural mapping, outperforming existing methods in fMRI synthesis and decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic methods fail to model biological variability and functional consistency in neural responses to visual stimuli.

Method: SynBrain uses BrainVAE for probabilistic neural representations and a Semantic-to-Neural Mapper for high-fidelity fMRI synthesis.

Result: SynBrain excels in subject-specific encoding, adapts to new subjects with minimal data, and improves fMRI-to-image decoding.

Conclusion: SynBrain captures interpretable neural variability and functional consistency, offering a robust tool for computational neuroscience.

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

TL;DR: FedKEI is a federated learning framework that uses cross-client and cross-task knowledge transfer to quickly adapt to new healthcare tasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable privacy-preserving collaboration in healthcare while efficiently adapting to new tasks or diseases using foundation models.

Method: FedKEI employs global clustering and bi-level optimization to personalize knowledge transfer for new tasks via adapter tuning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adapting to new diseases across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: FedKEI effectively leverages past knowledge for rapid adaptation in federated healthcare settings.

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: CLIP-Fed is a FL backdoor defense framework using vision-language models to address heterogeneous data and privacy concerns, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL backdoor defenses assume homogeneous data or require clean server datasets, limiting practicality. CLIP-Fed aims to defend against attacks under heterogeneous data while preserving model performance.

Method: CLIP-Fed integrates pre- and post-aggregation defense strategies, uses multimodal large language models for dataset augmentation, and aligns global model knowledge with CLIP using prototype contrastive loss and KL divergence.

Result: CLIP-Fed reduces ASR by 2.03% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving MA by 7.92% and 0.48%, respectively.

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed effectively defends against backdoor attacks in FL under heterogeneous data, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces welfare-centric clustering, focusing on group utilities via Rawlsian and Utilitarian objectives, outperforming traditional fair clustering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fair clustering may yield undesirable outcomes; the paper advocates for a welfare-centric approach to model group utilities.

Method: Models group utilities using distances and proportional representation, formalizes Rawlsian and Utilitarian objectives, and introduces novel algorithms with theoretical guarantees.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the methods significantly outperform existing fair clustering baselines.

Conclusion: Welfare-centric clustering, focusing on group utilities, provides better outcomes than traditional fairness notions.

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

TL;DR: A multi-level IDS framework for IoMT detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy, using meta-learning and OCC, achieving 99.77% accuracy and 97.8% F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional centralized IDSs are unsuitable for IoMT due to delays, privacy risks, and vulnerabilities, necessitating a decentralized solution.

Method: Proposes a multi-level framework: near Edge (coarse filtering via meta-learning/OCC), far Edge, and Cloud (attack type/novelty identification).

Result: Achieves 99.77% accuracy and 97.8% F1-score on the CICIoMT2024 dataset, with zero-day attack detection.

Conclusion: The framework is highly applicable for IoMT, addressing limitations of centralized IDSs and ensuring robust security.

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

*Samer Lahoud,Kinda Khawam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores distribution learning in semantic communication, establishing conditions for learning source statistics without prior knowledge, and reveals a trade-off between immediate performance and long-term learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how receivers can infer underlying meaning distributions in semantic communication, especially when priors are unknown, and to balance immediate semantic performance with long-term adaptability.

Method: The study proves learnability conditions (full rank of the transmission matrix), characterizes convergence rates, and quantifies semantic distortion from estimation errors. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate the framework.

Result: Learnability requires full rank of the transmission matrix. Encoding schemes optimized for immediate performance may hinder long-term learnability. System conditioning affects learning rate and performance.

Conclusion: The paper provides a rigorous analysis of statistical learning in semantic communication, offering design principles for balancing performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

*Jiyong Kim,Jaeho Lee,Jiahao Lin,Alish Kanani,Miao Sun,Umit Y. Ogras,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: eMamba is a hardware acceleration framework for Mamba models on edge devices, offering efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of optimized hardware acceleration for Mamba models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Replaces complex layers with lightweight alternatives, approximates expensive operations, and uses approximation-aware NAS.

Result: Achieves comparable accuracy with fewer parameters, lower latency, higher throughput, and reduced resource usage.

Conclusion: eMamba is efficient and effective for deploying Mamba models on edge platforms.

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

### [63] [A Unified Evaluation Framework for Multi-Annotator Tendency Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10393)
*Liyun Zhang,Jingcheng Ke,Shenli Fan,Xuanmeng Sha,Zheng Lian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified evaluation framework for Individual Tendency Learning (ITL) with two new metrics: DIC and BAE, to assess how well ITL methods capture annotator tendencies and provide behavioral explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ITL methods lack a proper evaluation framework to verify if they truly capture annotator-specific tendencies and provide meaningful explanations.

Method: Proposes two novel metrics: Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) and Behavior Alignment Explainability (BAE), using ground-truth and explainability-derived similarity structures.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm the framework's effectiveness in evaluating ITL methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework fills a critical gap in assessing ITL methods, ensuring they capture annotator tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

### [64] [XQuant: Breaking the Memory Wall for LLM Inference with KV Cache Rematerialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10395)
*Aditya Tomar,Coleman Hooper,Minjae Lee,Haocheng Xi,Rishabh Tiwari,Wonjun Kang,Luca Manolache,Michael W. Mahoney,Kurt Keutzer,Amir Gholami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XQuant reduces LLM inference memory usage by quantizing layer input activations instead of KV caching, achieving up to 10x memory savings with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient LLM inference is challenging due to high memory demands and bandwidth limitations, exacerbated by modern GPU hardware trends.

Method: XQuant quantizes and caches layer input activations (X), rematerializing Keys and Values on-the-fly, and introduces XQuant-CL for cross-layer compression.

Result: XQuant achieves up to 7.7x memory savings with <0.1 perplexity degradation; XQuant-CL attains 10x savings with 0.01 perplexity loss.

Conclusion: XQuant leverages hardware compute trends to surpass KV cache quantization, offering near-FP16 accuracy with significant memory efficiency.

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SC2Arena and StarEvolve address gaps in evaluating LLMs for complex decision-making in StarCraft II by providing a comprehensive benchmark and a hierarchical framework for strategic planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for StarCraft II lack full complexity (e.g., complete game context, diverse action spaces, all playable races), limiting AI's strategic planning and real-time adaptation capabilities.

Method: SC2Arena supports all playable races and low-level action spaces, while StarEvolve integrates strategic planning with tactical execution using a Planner-Executor-Verifier structure and iterative self-correction.

Result: StarEvolve achieves superior performance in strategic planning, and SC2Arena enables insights into developing generalist agents.

Conclusion: The proposed tools advance AI's ability in complex decision-making, with publicly available code and environments.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly
available.

### [66] [Unpacking the Implicit Norm Dynamics of Sharpness-Aware Minimization in Tensorized Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10435)
*Tianxiao Cao,Kyohei Atarashi,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAM improves generalization in overparameterized models, but its behavior in tensorized models is underexplored. This work analyzes SAM's norm dynamics, introduces Norm Deviation, and proposes DAS for better performance with less overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand SAM's behavior in general tensorized models and improve its efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: Analyze SAM's norm dynamics using scale-invariance, introduce Norm Deviation, and propose Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS).

Result: DAS matches or outperforms SAM in tasks like tensor completion and model compression, with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: DAS effectively mimics SAM's regularization, offering competitive performance with lower overhead.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

*Asiful Arefeen,Shovito Barua Soumma,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RealAC is a framework for generating realistic and actionable counterfactual explanations by preserving inter-feature dependencies and accommodating user constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for counterfactual explanations lack generalizability, fail to capture complex data relations, and ignore user preferences, leading to unrealistic or infeasible suggestions.

Method: RealAC aligns joint distributions of feature pairs to preserve dependencies without domain knowledge and allows users to freeze attributes they don't want to change.

Result: RealAC outperforms baselines and LLM-based methods in realism and actionability metrics like causal edge score and dependency preservation.

Conclusion: RealAC provides a causality-aware, user-centric solution for generating practical counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

### [68] [X-Node: Self-Explanation is All We Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10461)
*Prajit Sengupta,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-Node is a self-explaining GNN framework that generates per-node explanations during predictions, maintaining accuracy while improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs lack transparency in decision-making, especially in high-stakes clinical applications where interpretability is crucial. Existing explainability methods are post-hoc and global, failing to provide local insights.

Method: X-Node constructs structured context vectors for each node, encoding interpretable cues. A Reasoner module maps these into explanation vectors for reconstruction, natural language explanations, and guiding the GNN via text-injection.

Result: X-Node maintains competitive classification accuracy on MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST datasets while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

Conclusion: X-Node advances GNN interpretability by integrating self-explaining mechanisms into the prediction process, balancing accuracy and transparency.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

*Xinrui Li,Qilin Fan,Tianfu Wang,Kaiwen Wei,Ke Yu,Xu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphFedMIG addresses class imbalance in Federated Graph Learning (FGL) by using a hierarchical GAN for federated generative data augmentation, improving minority-class feature generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in FGL biases models toward majority classes, harming performance on rare events. GraphFedMIG aims to mitigate this by generating balanced, high-fidelity features.

Method: GraphFedMIG employs a hierarchical GAN with client-specific generators and cluster-shared discriminators, guided by mutual information to prioritize minority-class features.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show GraphFedMIG outperforms baselines, effectively addressing class imbalance in FGL.

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG successfully mitigates class imbalance in FGL through federated generative data augmentation, enhancing model performance on minority classes.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDAPT is a framework for BCIs that eliminates calibration by combining population-level pretraining and continual online finetuning, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BCIs face accuracy degradation due to neural signal drift and user variability, requiring frequent recalibration, which hinders practical deployment.

Method: EDAPT trains a baseline decoder on multi-user data, then continually personalizes it via supervised finetuning as neural patterns evolve. It also uses unsupervised domain adaptation for further gains.

Result: EDAPT improved accuracy across nine datasets for three BCI tasks, updating models efficiently (within 200ms) and scaling with total data budget.

Conclusion: EDAPT offers a practical solution for calibration-free BCIs, reducing deployment barriers by combining pretraining and continual adaptation.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights how common practices in recommender systems can introduce unobserved confounding, leading to biased results, and offers solutions to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unobserved confounding biases causal effect estimates in observational studies, and even recommender systems, despite using fully observed data, can suffer from similar issues due to ignored features.

Method: The paper uses simulation studies to illustrate how practices like feature engineering, A/B testing, and modularization introduce confounding in recommender systems.

Result: The simulations demonstrate that these practices can hamper system performance by introducing confounding.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical suggestions to help practitioners reduce or avoid confounding effects in real-world recommender systems.

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of

rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single
problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass
state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon reconstruction-based methods by leveraging JEPAs for more capable world models.

Method: Integrates sequence embeddings with neural ODEs, enforcing contractive embeddings and Lipschitz constants for structured latent spaces.

Result: Successfully generates structured latent state-space models for a pendulum system using image data.

Conclusion: The technique offers a new approach for general control algorithms and robotics applications.

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spectral framework is introduced to analyze and quantify the trade-off between smoothness and faithfulness in explanations for ReLU networks, addressing noisy gradient-based interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU networks produce noisy and hard-to-interpret gradient-based explanations due to sharp transitions and reliance on individual pixels. Existing methods like GradCAM sacrifice faithfulness for smoothness.

Method: A unifying spectral framework is developed to analyze and quantify smoothness and faithfulness in explanations. It regularizes high-frequency contributions in ReLU networks.

Result: The framework identifies an "explanation gap" caused by surrogate-based smoothing and validates findings across datasets and design choices.

Conclusion: The spectral framework provides a principled way to balance smoothness and faithfulness in explanations, improving interpretability of ReLU networks.

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

*Che-Yu Chou,Hung-Hsuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces automated codebook learning models using contrastive learning for multiclass classification, outperforming traditional ECOC methods in robustness to adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ECOC methods rely on manual or random codebooks, which are inefficient and may not adapt well to specific datasets.

Method: Three models for automated codebook learning are proposed, leveraging contrastive learning to adaptively learn codebooks from data.

Result: The models show superior robustness to adversarial attacks compared to baselines across four datasets.

Conclusion: Automated codebook learning with contrastive learning is a promising approach for improving multiclass classification with ECOC.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four
datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial
attacks compared to two baselines. The source is available at

### [76] [Nonlocal Monte Carlo via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10520)
*Dmitrii Dobrynin,Masoud Mohseni,John Paul Strachan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to enhance Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms, improving performance on hard combinatorial optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MCMC methods struggle with hard benchmarks due to homogeneous temperature profiles, leading to inefficiency in exploring and exploiting the solution space.

Method: Deep RL is used to train nonlocal transition policies in NMC, leveraging energy changes and landscape geometry as rewards and states.

Result: The trained RL policies outperform standard MCMC and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard 4-SAT benchmarks in energy, speed, and solution diversity.

Conclusion: Deep RL can effectively optimize NMC algorithms, addressing limitations of conventional methods in combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

*Hao Luan,Yi Xian Goh,See-Kiong Ng,Chun Kai Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCD is a test-time framework for joint generation from multiple diffusion models, enforcing constraints without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating correlated samples from multiple pre-trained diffusion models while enforcing constraints without costly retraining.

Method: Introduces Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), which adds coupled guidance and projection steps to enforce constraints during generation.

Result: Effective in image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning, with improved coupling and constraint satisfaction.

Conclusion: PCD successfully enables constrained joint generation without excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Applm, a framework using the xTrimoPGLM protein language model, outperforms existing methods in allergen protein identification, especially in challenging scenarios like novel allergens and high-similarity homologs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Allergens pose a public health challenge, and accurate identification is crucial. Existing methods may struggle with novel or highly similar allergens.

Method: Applm leverages the xTrimoPGLM protein language model, trained on one trillion tokens, to detect allergens in diverse scenarios.

Result: Applm consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in tasks like identifying novel allergens and differentiating among homologs.

Conclusion: Applm, supported by xTrimoPGLM, is effective for allergen prediction and is provided as open-source software with benchmark datasets for future research.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

### [79] [Stabilizing Long-term Multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Gated Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10548)
*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Zhuoen Chen,Yuhuai Qin,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA) to address reward sparsity and misalignment in long-horizon RL, specifically for software engineering tasks, improving completion and modification rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward sparsity and misalignment in long-horizon RL tasks, especially in software engineering, hinder optimal policy learning. Existing methods struggle with bias or task decomposition.

Method: Proposes SWE-oriented RL Framework and G-RA, which accumulates immediate rewards only when long-term rewards meet a threshold, ensuring stable optimization.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in completion rates (47.6% to 93.8%) and modification rates (19.6% to 23.8%), avoiding policy degradation.

Conclusion: G-RA effectively balances reward accumulation in long-horizon RL, offering a practical solution for software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

*Jeroen Berrevoets,Julianna Piskorz,Robert Davis,Harry Amad,Jim Weatherall,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CATE-B is an open-source co-pilot system using LLMs to simplify treatment effect estimation by guiding users through causal modeling, adjustment set identification, and method selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of causal inference techniques limits their adoption; CATE-B aims to make rigorous causal analysis more accessible.

Method: CATE-B employs LLMs for causal discovery, edge orientation, adjustment set identification, and regression method selection, supported by benchmark tasks.

Result: The system provides interactive assistance, reducing the expertise needed for treatment effect estimation.

Conclusion: CATE-B lowers barriers to causal analysis and introduces benchmarks for automated TE estimation.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

### [81] [GNN-based Unified Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10583)
*Furkan Pala,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified learning improves generalizability of heterogeneous deep learning models in medical imaging by unifying them in a shared graph learning space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of maintaining model generalizability under domain-fracture scenarios in medical imaging, where distribution shifts arise from diverse factors like imaging techniques and patient populations.

Method: Proposes unified learning, encoding each model into a graph representation and optimizing them using a unified GNN (uGNN) for parameter sharing and knowledge transfer.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance on MorphoMNIST and MedMNIST benchmarks, showing robustness to unseen data with large distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Unified learning effectively enhances generalizability across heterogeneous models and datasets in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

*Xuanhao Mu,Gökhan Demirel,Yuzhe Zhang,Jianlei Liu,Thorsten Schlachter,Veit Hagenmeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs) method for upsampling energy network time series, reducing RMSE by 9% and improving MPC accuracy by 13%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional upsampling methods and advanced models (e.g., time series generation, Super-Resolution, imputation) in energy network design, which suffer from information loss, noise, or require unavailable high-resolution data.

Method: Proposes a Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs) approach that learns to generate high-resolution time series without ground-truth data, overcoming the supervised learning paradox.

Result: The method reduces RMSE by 9% compared to conventional interpolation and improves MPC accuracy by 13%.

Conclusion: GATs offer a viable solution for upsampling in energy networks, addressing key challenges of existing methods and enhancing performance without needing high-resolution training data.

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FreeGAD is a training-free graph anomaly detection method that uses an affinity-gated residual encoder and anchor-guided statistical deviations, outperforming existing deep learning-based methods in performance, efficiency, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based GAD methods are costly and poorly scalable due to complex training. Empirical findings suggest training may not significantly boost performance.

Method: FreeGAD employs an affinity-gated residual encoder for anomaly-aware representations and uses anchor nodes to guide anomaly score calculations via statistical deviations.

Result: FreeGAD achieves superior performance, efficiency, and scalability across multiple benchmark datasets without training or iterative optimization.

Conclusion: FreeGAD demonstrates that training-free methods can effectively detect anomalies, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to resource-intensive deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

TL;DR: The paper addresses reliability issues in deep network explanations by introducing probabilistic and spectral analyses, revealing spectral bias in gradient-based methods and proposing remedies like standardized perturbation scales and SpectralLens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability and formalism of explanation methods for deep networks, addressing issues like spectral bias and inconsistent explanations.

Method: Adopts probabilistic and spectral perspectives to analyze explanation methods, identifies spectral bias in gradients, and proposes remedies like perturbation scale standardization and SpectralLens.

Result: Reveals spectral bias in gradient-based explanations, explains experimental design choices (e.g., squared gradient, input perturbation), and validates theoretical findings quantitatively.

Conclusion: The study provides a formal framework to address reliability issues in explanation methods, offering practical solutions like SpectralLens and standardized perturbation scales.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The distributed nature of SL introduces security risks, requiring a thorough exploration of attacks and defenses.

Method: Systematic review of SL attacks, classification by attacker role, privacy risks, timing, and vulnerabilities, plus defense analysis.

Result: Identified security gaps, effectiveness, and limitations of defenses, with open challenges for future research.

Conclusion: Provides insights to enhance SL privacy and guide further research on security in collaborative learning.

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a collaborative learning approach that improves
privacy by keeping data on the client-side while sharing only the intermediate
output with a server. However, the distributed nature of SL introduces new
security challenges, necessitating a comprehensive exploration of potential
attacks. This paper systematically reviews various attacks on SL, classifying
them based on factors such as the attacker's role, the type of privacy risks,
when data leaks occur, and where vulnerabilities exist. We also analyze
existing defense methods, including cryptographic methods, data modification
approaches, distributed techniques, and hybrid solutions. Our findings reveal
security gaps, highlighting the effectiveness and limitations of existing
defenses. By identifying open challenges and future directions, this work

*Chenkai Guo,Yikai Zhu,Jing Yangum,Renxiang Guan,Por Lip Yee,Guangdun Peng,Dayu Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPHENIC improves spatial transcriptomics clustering by integrating topological features and optimizing spatial embeddings, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spatial transcriptomics clustering are limited by noisy data and poor spatial neighborhood modeling.

Method: SPHENIC uses persistent homology for stable representation and a Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM) for better embeddings.

Result: SPHENIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% on 14 benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SPHENIC effectively addresses limitations in spatial clustering, offering superior performance.

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

*Davide Guidobene,Lorenzo Benedetti,Diego Arapovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses sample inefficiency in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) by applying variance-reduction techniques to policy gradient methods, maintaining scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MORL is essential for complex decision-making with conflicting objectives, but existing policy gradient methods suffer from high sample inefficiency.

Method: The authors implement variance-reduction techniques to improve the sample complexity of policy gradients in MORL.

Result: The proposed method reduces sample complexity while preserving scalability for large state-action spaces.

Conclusion: Variance-reduction techniques effectively enhance the sample efficiency of policy gradients in MORL without restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

TL;DR: REFN uses RL-trained LLMs to autonomously generate network filters for 1/n-day exploit prevention, outperforming existing methods in accuracy, speed, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses (host patching, network filtering) are inadequate due to scalability, compatibility, and deployment issues. REFN addresses these gaps.

Method: REFN employs RL-driven LLMs, online network rewards, edge gateway deployment, and online validation to generate and validate network filters.

Result: REFN achieves 21.1% higher accuracy, reduces Mean Time To Patch to 3.65 hours, and scales to 10K devices.

Conclusion: REFN is a scalable, efficient solution for preventing 1/n-day exploits, marking progress in LLM-driven security.

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes using Item Response Theory (IRT) to improve dataset partitioning for ML model validation, revealing instance heterogeneity and improving model performance understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data partitioning ignores instance quality, so IRT is introduced to better characterize and guide partitioning.

Method: IRT parameters are used to partition datasets, and their impact on ML model performance is evaluated across four tabular datasets.

Result: IRT reveals instance heterogeneity and creates balanced partitions, improving understanding of bias-variance tradeoff. High-guessing instances negatively impact model performance.

Conclusion: IRT-informed partitioning enhances ML model validation by identifying informative subgroups and optimizing performance.

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

TL;DR: A GPU-powered antenna simulation framework using open-source EM software (gprMax) is proposed for machine learning applications, outperforming CPUs and matching commercial software results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning in antenna design requires large datasets, but EM simulations are computationally expensive. GPUs offer a solution to generate sufficient training data efficiently.

Method: Utilizes GPUs for simulating large numbers of antennas with predefined/random parameters, compares results with commercial EM software, and evaluates machine/deep learning models for parameter estimation.

Result: Entry-level GPUs outperform high-end CPUs, with gaming GPUs achieving ~18x speedup. Open-source software matches commercial results for microstrip antennas at fine resolutions.

Conclusion: GPU acceleration enables efficient large-scale antenna simulations for machine learning, with open-source tools providing viable alternatives to commercial software.

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

TL;DR: A new method for predicting binding free energy changes (ΔΔG) in protein engineering by decomposing it into sequence-based and structure-based components, outperforming existing deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting ΔΔG is crucial for protein and PPI engineering in drug discovery, but estimating full conformational distributions is intractable. This work aims to simplify the process using energy-based models.

Method: Decomposes ΔΔG into sequence-based (inverse folding model) and structure-based (energy model) components, assuming equilibrium between bound and unbound states to simplify degeneracy estimation.

Result: Demonstrates superiority over state-of-the-art deep learning methods in ΔΔG prediction and SARS-CoV-2 antibody optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines sequence and structure-based approaches with physical inductive bias, improving ΔΔG prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes APFL, a dual-stream least squares method for Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), addressing non-IID data challenges with a foundation model for feature extraction and dual-stream analytic models for global generalization and local personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PFL methods struggle with non-IID data, hindering collective generalization and personalization.

Method: Uses a frozen backbone for feature extraction and dual-stream analytic models (shared primary stream for global generalization, refinement stream for local personalization).

Result: Achieves heterogeneity invariance, with empirical results showing 1.10%-15.45% accuracy improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: APFL effectively addresses non-IID challenges in PFL, offering superior performance and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

*Yihua Wang,Qi Jia,Cong Xu,Feiyu Chen,Yuhan Liu,Haotian Zhang,Liang Jin,Lu Liu,Zhichun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses shortcut learning in multimodal sarcasm detection, introduces MUStARD++$^{R}$ to remove shortcuts, and proposes MCIB for effective fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcut learning in datasets impairs generalization, and current fusion strategies are ineffective for sarcasm detection.

Method: Construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcuts; introduce MCIB for efficient multimodal fusion.

Result: MCIB achieves top performance without relying on shortcuts.

Conclusion: Effective modality fusion is crucial for sarcasm detection, and MCIB provides a robust solution.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR with Pass@1 rewards struggles with exploration-exploitation balance. Using Pass@k as reward improves exploration, and analytical solutions show mutual enhancement of exploration and exploitation. Advantage design is promising for RLVR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of balancing exploration and exploitation in RLVR with Pass@1 rewards, and explore the overlooked potential of Pass@k rewards in enhancing exploration.

Method: Use Pass@k as the reward for training (Pass@k Training), derive an analytical solution for its advantage, and explore advantage design for RLVR.

Result: Pass@k Training improves exploration ability, and exploration-exploitation can mutually enhance each other. Advantage design shows promising results.

Conclusion: Pass@k Training and advantage design offer effective solutions for RLVR, with potential for future exploration in advantage function design.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming quadratic scaling of attention mechanisms in transformers for large physical systems.

Method: Adapt NSA for non-sequential data, implement Erwin NSA model, and evaluate on cosmology, molecular dynamics, and air pressure datasets.

Result: Performance matches or exceeds original Erwin model; experimental results from Erwin paper are validated.

Conclusion: Erwin NSA effectively addresses quadratic attention complexity, enhancing transformer efficiency for large-scale physical systems.

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of transformers on datasets of large physical systems
depends on overcoming the quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism. This
work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention
(NSA) mechanism to improve the efficiency and receptive field of transformer
models for large-scale physical systems, addressing the challenge of quadratic
attention complexity. We adapt the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data,
implement the Erwin NSA model, and evaluate it on three datasets from the
physical sciences -- cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air
pressure modeling -- achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of the
original Erwin model. Additionally, we reproduce the experimental results from
the Erwin paper to validate their implementation.

*Debvrat Varshney,Vibhas Vats,Bhartendu Pandey,Christa Brelsford,Philipe Dias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Generative AI (GenAI) for forecasting land-use and land-cover change (LULC), addressing a gap in current Earth System models. It demonstrates feasibility with a diffusion model for imperviousness forecasting, outperforming a no-change baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Earth System models lack skill in forecasting LULC, a critical input for assessing risks and consequences in future climate scenarios.

Method: Frames LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem using Generative AI (GenAI), specifically a diffusion model trained on historical data for imperviousness forecasting.

Result: The diffusion model outperforms a no-change baseline, showing lower MAE for resolutions ≥ 0.7×0.7 km² across 12 metropolitan areas.

Conclusion: Generative models can capture spatiotemporal patterns for LULC forecasting, with future research aimed at incorporating auxiliary Earth properties and scenario simulations.

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

*Shouju Wang,Yuchen Song,Sheng'en Li,Dongmian Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DECAF-GAD is a framework addressing fairness in autoencoder-based graph anomaly detection (GAD) by disentangling sensitive attributes and enhancing fairness without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in GAD is underexplored, and GNN-based models can amplify biases. Existing fair GNNs focus on node classification, not autoencoder-based GAD.

Method: Proposes DECAF-GAD using a structural causal model (SCM) to disentangle sensitive attributes, with a specialized autoencoder and fairness-guided loss.

Result: Achieves competitive GAD performance and significantly improves fairness metrics on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD effectively balances fairness and performance in GAD, addressing a critical gap in the field.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a graph classification approach that combines the expressive power of Weisfeiler-Leman variants with the efficiency of tabular data methods.

Method: Tabularize graph data using Weisfeiler-Leman variants, modify logical frameworks, and apply tabular data techniques. Theoretical analysis of expressive power and empirical testing on benchmark datasets.

Result: Matches state-of-the-art accuracy in graph classification while being more time or memory efficient. Interpretable modal logic formulas can be extracted.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, efficient, and interpretable, offering a viable alternative to graph neural networks and kernels.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for graph classification based on tabularizing
graph data via variants of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and then applying
methods for tabular data. We investigate a comprehensive class of
Weisfeiler-Leman variants obtained by modifying the underlying logical
framework and establish a precise theoretical characterization of their
expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark
datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate
that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural
networks and graph kernels while being more time or memory efficient, depending
on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal
logic formulas from graph datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDNS, a framework for training neural samplers to generate samples from discrete state spaces with known but unnormalized probability mass functions, addressing challenges like large cardinality and multi-modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of sampling from complex discrete distributions is crucial in fields like statistical physics and machine learning but remains challenging due to high dimensions and multi-modality.

Method: Proposes MDNS, a framework aligning path measures via learning objectives, grounded in stochastic optimal control of continuous-time Markov chains.

Result: MDNS outperforms baselines in efficiency and scalability, accurately sampling from high-dimensional, multi-modal distributions.

Conclusion: MDNS is effective and scalable, demonstrating potential for broader applications in sampling tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from
discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function
$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when
the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we
propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural
$\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete
neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning
objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the
continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of
MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

*Dong Xu,Zhangfan Yang,Jenna Xinyi Yao,Shuangbao Song,Zexuan Zhu,Junkai Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBEX improves structure-based drug discovery by addressing data scarcity with a coarse-to-fine pipeline, enhancing docking success and molecular properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of protein-ligand complex data limits the effectiveness of existing generative models, leading to overfitting and poor generalization.

Method: IBEX uses PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to analyze data density, employs Scaffold Hopping for better transfer, and refines molecules with physics-based optimization.

Result: IBEX increases docking success from 53% to 64%, improves Vina scores, and achieves better validity, diversity, and reduced error.

Conclusion: IBEX effectively tackles data scarcity in drug discovery, outperforming existing methods in key metrics.

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

TL;DR: A comparison of reduction criteria for Online Gaussian Processes (GPs) to handle streaming data efficiently, with practical guidelines for selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational limitations of GPs in streaming scenarios by evaluating and comparing datapoint reduction methods.

Method: Unified comparison of reduction criteria, analyzing computational complexity and behavior, tested on benchmarks and real-world datasets.

Result: Evaluation provides insights into the performance of different criteria, with proposed acceptance criteria for redundancy filtering.

Conclusion: Practical guidelines are offered for selecting appropriate reduction criteria in Online GP algorithms.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

Motivation: To address critical limitations in Transformer architectures, such as long-range context retention and continual learning, by integrating neuroscience principles with engineering advances.

Method: Presents a unified framework organizing progress through taxonomic dimensions: functional objectives, memory representations, and integration mechanisms. Analyzes core memory operations like reading, writing, and forgetting.

Result: Identifies a shift toward adaptive, test-time learning systems and highlights challenges like scalability and interference, with emerging solutions like hierarchical buffering.

Conclusion: Provides a roadmap for developing cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer architectures by synthesizing neuroscience and AI advancements.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML) to unify and clarify existing work, aiding practitioners in implementing DM principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data minimization is a key principle in data protection regulations, but its application in ML is fragmented, causing confusion among practitioners.

Method: The authors propose a comprehensive DMML framework, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and minimization points, and systematically review related literature.

Result: The framework provides a structured overview, enabling better application of DM principles in ML and fostering a unified understanding.

Conclusion: The work bridges gaps in DMML research, promoting broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

### [105] [Efficiently Verifiable Proofs of Data Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10866)
*Ari Karchmer,Seth Neel,Martin Pawelczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interactive verification protocol for data attribution to address trust issues in computationally expensive methods, ensuring efficiency and correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of data attribution methods creates trust issues, especially for resource-constrained parties relying on attributions for critical applications like data pricing.

Method: An interactive proof protocol between a Prover (computationally powerful) and a Verifier (resource-constrained) ensures formal guarantees of correctness and efficiency.

Result: The protocol provides PAC verification, ensuring the Verifier accepts attributions close to optimal with high probability, while detecting deviations by the Prover.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol offers a scalable and trustworthy solution for verifying data attributions, with broad applicability to linear functions over the boolean hypercube.

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shared micromobility's growth causes social problems like road overload and inequity, exacerbated by non-cooperative operators. Existing intrusive control methods are impractical.

Method: Designs REALISM with fairness-aware score assignment using Shapley value, optimizing via an alternating procedure between operators and regulators.

Result: Achieves 39.93% better equity in vehicle usage and 1.82% higher demand satisfaction in Chicago.

Conclusion: REALISM effectively balances city goals and operator interests, improving micromobility service fairness and efficiency.

Abstract: Shared micromobility (e.g., shared bikes and electric scooters), as a kind of
emerging urban transportation, has become more and more popular in the world.
However, the blooming of shared micromobility vehicles brings some social
problems to the city (e.g., overloaded vehicles on roads, and the inequity of
vehicle deployment), which deviate from the city regulator's expectation of the
service of the shared micromobility system. In addition, the multi-operator
shared micromobility system in a city complicates the problem because of their
non-cooperative self-interested pursuits. Existing regulatory frameworks of
multi-operator vehicle rebalancing generally assume the intrusive control of
vehicle rebalancing of all the operators, which is not practical in the real
world. To address this limitation, we design REALISM, a regulatory framework
for coordinated scheduling in multi-operator shared micromobility services that
incorporates the city regulator's regulations in the form of assigning a score
to each operator according to the city goal achievements and operators'
individual contributions to achieving the city goal, measured by Shapley value.
To realize the fairness-aware score assignment, we measure the fairness of
assigned scores and use them as one of the components to optimize the score
assignment model. To optimize the whole framework, we develop an alternating
procedure to make operators and the city regulator interact with each other
until convergence. We evaluate our framework based on real-world e-scooter
usage data in Chicago. Our experiment results show that our method achieves a
performance gain of at least 39.93% in the equity of vehicle usage and 1.82% in
the average demand satisfaction of the whole city.
