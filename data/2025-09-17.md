*Xingxing Hong,Yungong Wang,Dexin Jin,Ye Yuan,Ximing Huang,Zijian Wu,Wenxin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HLSMAC is a new StarCraft II benchmark with 12 scenarios based on classical stratagems, designed to evaluate high-level strategic decision-making in MARL beyond micromanagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic intelligence in multi-agent systems.

Method: Developed 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on the Thirty-Six Stratagems, each challenging agents with strategic elements like tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception. Proposed novel metrics beyond win rate including ability utilization and advancement efficiency.

Result: Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents demonstrate that HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic decision-making capabilities.

Conclusion: HLSMAC successfully addresses the gap in evaluating high-level strategic intelligence in MARL and provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing strategic decision-making capabilities in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising costs and complexity of financial crime compliance without measurable effectiveness improvements, coupled with opaque AI solutions that lack regulatory alignment.

Method: Action Design Research (ADR) process with fintech firm and regulatory stakeholders, using artifact-centric modeling to assign bounded roles to autonomous agents with task-specific model routing and audit logging.

Result: Developed reference architecture and real-world prototype demonstrating how agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory constraints while supporting transparency and institutional trust.

Conclusion: Agentic AI embedded within accountable governance structures can enable effective automation in high-stakes regulated environments, extending IS literature on AI-enabled compliance.

Abstract: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,
often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers
potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory
expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI
system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an
Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory
stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and
reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.
Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,
regulated environments.

### [4] [DISPLIB: a library of train dispatching problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12254)
*Oddvar Kloster,Bj√∏rnar Luteberget,Carlo Mannino,Giorgio Sartor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces DISPLIB - a common problem definition and file format for train re-routing and rescheduling to enable reproducibility and performance comparisons across different optimization algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimization algorithms for train dispatching are tied to specific industrial cases with no shared code/data, hindering reproducibility and preventing fair performance comparisons between different approaches.

Method: Created a standardized problem definition and file format (DISPLIB) that captures main features of train re-routing/rescheduling, gathered real-world problem instances, and developed a reference solver implementation.

Result: Established an open repository of industrial problem instances and a common framework that enables researchers to work on train dispatching without industrial connections and perform empirical solver comparisons.

Conclusion: DISPLIB provides a foundation for reproducible research and fair performance evaluation in train dispatching optimization, similar to established communities like MILP, SAT, TSP, and VRP.

Abstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

### [5] [InPhyRe Discovers: Large Multimodal Models Struggle in Inductive Physical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12263)
*Gautam Sreekumar,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InPhyRe benchmark reveals LMMs struggle with inductive physical reasoning, showing poor adaptation to unseen physical laws, language bias, and visual input neglect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs only encode parametric knowledge from training but lack human-like ability to adapt physical reasoning to unseen environments, which is critical for safety-critical applications.

Method: Created InPhyRe benchmark using algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos to evaluate LMMs' ability to predict collision outcomes in novel physical scenarios.

Result: 13 tested LMMs showed: 1) difficulty applying limited parametric knowledge, 2) weak inductive reasoning when demonstrations violate physical laws, 3) language bias and visual input neglect.

Conclusion: LMMs currently lack trustworthy inductive physical reasoning capabilities, questioning their reliability for visual-based physical reasoning tasks in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

### [6] [LLMAP: LLM-Assisted Multi-Objective Route Planning with User Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12273)
*Liangqi Yuan,Dong-Jun Han,Christopher G. Brinton,Sabine Brunswicker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMAP system combines LLM-as-Parser for natural language understanding with Multi-Step Graph Search algorithm for optimal route planning, handling multiple constraints and achieving superior performance across global locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based route planning approaches struggle with handling extensive map data or understanding natural language preferences, and face challenges with heterogeneous spatio-temporal user distribution.

Method: Uses LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language and extract preferences, coupled with Multi-Step Graph construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm for route optimization with adaptive objective weight tuning.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated across 1,000 routing prompts in 14 countries and 27 cities, with guarantees across multiple constraints including time limits, POI hours, and task dependencies.

Conclusion: The LLMAP system effectively bridges the gap between natural language understanding and optimal route planning, providing robust performance across diverse global scenarios with multiple constraints.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Development of a smart aeroponic greenhouse system integrating IoT and AI for monitoring environmental conditions and detecting plant diseases in Geranium plants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient environmental control and timely management decisions in greenhouse crop production through continuous monitoring of plant status and environmental conditions.

Method: IoT-based platform for environmental monitoring and control, combined with AI disease detection framework using VGG-19, InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze plant images after intentional inoculation.

Result: IoT system successfully published real-time data (temperature, humidity, water flow, tank volume) and adjusted parameters for optimal growth. VGG-19 achieved 92% accuracy in detecting drought stress and rust leaves, outperforming other algorithms.

Conclusion: The integrated IoT-AI system effectively monitors greenhouse conditions and detects plant diseases with high accuracy, providing valuable insights for informed management decisions in crop production.

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

*Sasi Kiran Gaddipati,Farhana Keya,Gollam Rabby,S√∂ren Auer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIssistant is an open-source Human-AI collaborative framework that streamlines scientific workflow creation, improving drafting efficiency and thematic consistency while maintaining human oversight for accuracy and rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-assisted research tools are fragmented and lack human-centered workflows, creating gaps in the end-to-end scientific research process.

Method: Developed a modular agentic framework with tools for literature synthesis, experimentation, citation management, and LaTeX generation. Evaluated through independent human review (NeurIPS standards), automated LLM review (GPT-5), and program chair oversight.

Result: AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and thematic consistency. Human-AI collaboration proved essential for maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical compliance.

Conclusion: While effective, the system has limitations including hallucinated citations, difficulty with dynamic paper structures, and incomplete multimodal integration. Human oversight remains crucial in AI-assisted scientific workflows.

Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

### [9] [Small Models, Big Results: Achieving Superior Intent Extraction through Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12423)
*Danielle Cohen,Yoni Halpern,Noam Kahlon,Joel Oren,Omri Berkovitch,Sapir Caduri,Ido Dagan,Anatoly Efros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel decomposed approach for on-device intent inference from UI interactions using structured summarization and fine-tuned models, outperforming large MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small on-device models struggle with accurate intent inference from UI interaction trajectories, while large MLLMs require datacenter resources and compromise privacy. There's a need for privacy-preserving, low-cost, low-latency solutions.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Structured interaction summarization to capture key information from each user action, 2) Intent extraction using a fine-tuned model operating on aggregated summaries.

Result: The method improves intent understanding in resource-constrained models and even surpasses the base performance of large multi-modal large language models (MLLMs).

Conclusion: The decomposed approach enables effective on-device intent inference while maintaining privacy, low cost, and low latency, making it superior to datacenter-based large models for this specific application.

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

### [10] [Building Coding Agents via Entropy-Enhanced Multi-Turn Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12434)
*Jiahao Yu,Zelei Cheng,Xian Wu,Xinyu Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework called \sys enhances preference optimization algorithms for multi-turn, tool-assisted coding tasks by preserving policy entropy and enabling TTS scaling, achieving state-of-the-art results on SWE-bench with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with complex software engineering tasks that require multi-step reasoning and tool integration. Standard alignment methods like DPO and KTO reduce output diversity, limiting test-time scaling effectiveness for coding benchmarks like SWE-bench.

Method: \sys framework adapts preference optimization algorithms to multi-turn, tool-assisted settings by augmenting the preference objective to preserve policy entropy and generalizing learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than single responses. Also includes hybrid best-trajectory selection combining learned verifier with model-free approaches.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art results on SWE-bench leaderboard among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranked 1st on SWE-bench Lite and 4th on SWE-bench Verified, outperformed only by models with 10x more parameters.

Conclusion: \sys successfully bridges the gap between preference optimization and multi-turn reasoning requirements for coding agents, enabling smaller models to achieve competitive performance through entropy preservation and effective test-time scaling.

Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

TL;DR: PIWM is a compact physics-informed world model that uses Soft Mask training and Warm Start inference to achieve better performance than larger models while being faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between model size and performance in world models, making accurate physics prediction practical for edge devices.

Method: Physics-Informed BEV World Model with Soft Mask training for dynamic object modeling and Warm Start inference technique for zero-shot prediction enhancement.

Result: At 400M parameters, PIWM surpasses baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score. Smallest PIWM (130M) beats largest baseline (400M) by 7.4% with 28% faster inference.

Conclusion: PIWM demonstrates that compact models can outperform larger ones through physics-informed design and efficient training/inference techniques, enabling practical deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

### [12] [Reasoning Models Can be Accurately Pruned Via Chain-of-Thought Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12464)
*Ryan Lucas,Kayhan Behdin,Zhipeng Wang,Qingquan Song,Shao Tang,Rahul Mazumder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reasoning-Aware Compression (RAC) improves pruning for reasoning models by incorporating chain-of-thought reconstruction, boosting performance over standard methods that focus only on input reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard pruning techniques cause significant performance loss in reasoning language models like DeepSeek-R1, making them slower and less effective due to their focus on input reconstruction rather than reasoning-specific tasks.

Method: Introduces Reasoning-Aware Compression (RAC) that jointly reconstructs activations from both input and the model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces during pruning, integrating seamlessly with existing workflows like SparseGPT.

Result: RAC significantly boosts pruning performance for reasoning models, addressing the limitations of standard pruning methods that cause worse performance and increased thinking tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed RAC method provides a simple, drop-in fix that enhances pruning effectiveness for reasoning language models by incorporating reasoning-specific reconstruction objectives.

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the
paper can be found at: https://github.com/RyanLucas3/RAC

Conclusion: PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy in statistical power analysis for clinical research, already being deployed across multiple institutions.

Abstract: Sample size calculations for power analysis are critical for clinical
research and trial design, yet their complexity and reliance on statistical
expertise create barriers for many researchers. We introduce PowerGPT, an
AI-powered system integrating large language models (LLMs) with statistical
engines to automate test selection and sample size estimation in trial design.
In a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness, PowerGPT significantly
improved task completion rates (99.3% vs. 88.9% for test selection, 99.3% vs.
77.8% for sample size calculation) and accuracy (94.1% vs. 55.4% in sample size
estimation, p < 0.001), while reducing average completion time (4.0 vs. 9.3
minutes, p < 0.001). These gains were consistent across various statistical
tests and benefited both statisticians and non-statisticians as well as
bridging expertise gaps. Already under deployment across multiple institutions,
PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility,

TL;DR: The paper maps computational complexity concepts from the Soma Cube puzzle to cognitive problem-solving strategies, showing how material artifacts and cognitive strategies reduce task difficulty by lowering branching factors and effective time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge cognitive science and theoretical computer science by classifying task difficulty and explaining how mechanisms of intelligence reduce complexity through physical and cognitive strategies.

Method: Analyzed the Soma Cube puzzle's branching factor through search tree outdegree, then systematically layered cognitive strategies including preprocessing (chunking), value ordering (free-sorting), variable ordering (scaffolding), and pruning (inference) onto trial-and-error search.

Result: Quantitative assessment showed how different strategies modify complexity, demonstrating that competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity by exploiting physical constraints.

Conclusion: Intelligence can be modeled as a library of algorithms that recruit both mind and matter capabilities, with materiality playing a crucial role in reducing cognitive task difficulty.

Abstract: Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

TL;DR: This study analyzes Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step explainable workflow combining Cluster Correspondence Analysis to identify crash patterns and tree-based severity modeling with SHAP interpretation to quantify injury risk factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes but risk patterns vary by conditions, requiring better understanding of co-occurring factors and mechanisms behind injury severity to improve safety interventions.

Method: Two-step explainable workflow: 1) Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) to identify co-occurring factors and four crash patterns, 2) Tree-based severity model interpreted with SHAP to quantify injury drivers within and across patterns.

Result: Higher severity occurs when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds coincide with fixed-object or angle events. Lower severity in clear, low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations reveal mechanisms: fail-to-yield at entries, improper maneuvers in multi-lane circulation, and rear-ends during slow-downs.

Conclusion: The workflow links pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening, countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. Provides a practical template for usable XAI in public safety analytics.

Abstract: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at
entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation
(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to
Information Systems is a practical template for usable XAI in public safety
analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Customer experience suffers from high handling times and low resolution rates due to agent cognitive load from navigating fragmented systems and manual troubleshooting. Existing AI tools are reactive and lack deeper contextual reasoning.

Method: Developed Minerva CQ - a real-time Agent Assist product that integrates real-time transcription, intent/sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval, dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries to enable proactive workflows.

Result: Deployed in live production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot delivering measurable improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple deployments.

Conclusion: Agentic AI systems that are goal-driven, autonomous, and tool-using can proactively support agents in real time, overcoming limitations of conventional reactive approaches and significantly improving customer support outcomes.

Abstract: Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live
production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable
improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DaSAThco is a framework that uses LLMs to generate specialized heuristic ensembles for SAT solvers and learns adaptive selection mechanisms, achieving superior performance and robust out-of-domain generalization compared to non-adaptive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers rely on internal heuristics, but SAT problems are heterogeneous making a single optimal configuration impossible. Prior automated methods lack generalizability and require costly re-optimization for new problem types.

Method: Uses Large Language Model guided by Problem Archetypes to generate diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles, then learns adaptive selection mechanism to form final mapping from instance features to tailored heuristics.

Result: DaSAThco achieves superior performance and demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive methods show limitations.

Conclusion: Establishes a more scalable and practical path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems through train-once, adapt-broadly model.

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

*Anmol Singhal Navya Singhal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AD-FCoT is a prompting framework that combines analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought prompting for financial sentiment analysis, outperforming baselines without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial sentiment analysis methods struggle with capturing complex economic context and lack transparent reasoning, undermining reliability for market prediction.

Method: Analogy-Driven Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT) guides LLMs to draw parallels between new events and historical scenarios with known outcomes, embedding analogies into structured step-by-step reasoning chains through prompting only.

Result: AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns on thousands of news articles.

Conclusion: The framework provides interpretable insights that align with domain expertise and is suitable for real-world financial analysis without requiring additional training data or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market
movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been
renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

TL;DR: GBV-SQL is a multi-agent framework that uses SQL2Text back-translation validation to ensure generated SQL queries accurately reflect user intent, while also exposing systemic flaws in current Text2SQL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the semantic gap where syntactically valid SQL queries often misinterpret user intent, and reveal the poor quality of existing benchmarks that obscure true model performance.

Method: Propose GBV-SQL with Guided Generation using SQL2Text Back-translation Validation - a specialized agent translates generated SQL back to natural language to verify logical alignment with original questions.

Result: Achieves 63.23% execution accuracy on BIRD benchmark (5.8% improvement) and 96.5-97.6% accuracy on Spider benchmark after removing flawed examples. Introduces typology for 'Gold Errors' in benchmark data.

Conclusion: Provides both a robust semantic validation framework and critical perspective on benchmark integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation in Text2SQL evaluation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Random Forest model outperforms SVR and LSTM for cattle weight gain prediction, achieving R^2 of 0.973 when including weather and age factors, with an automated preprocessing tool developed for dataset preparation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting mob-based cattle weight gain benefits large livestock farms by enabling refined feeding strategies, educated breeding choices, and risk reduction from climate variability and market fluctuations.

Method: Proposed MB CWG technique using Random Forest model compared against SVR and LSTM models, using 756 samples from 108 cattle with weather data (rainfall and temperature) and age factors.

Result: RF model performed best across all datasets with R^2 of 0.973, RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were included, significantly outperforming SVR and LSTM.

Conclusion: RF is a robust tool for cattle weight gain forecasting, with weather and age factors being crucial for accuracy. An innovative automated preprocessing tool was developed and made publicly available on GitHub for future research.

Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ECG-aBcDe is a novel ECG encoding method that transforms ECG signals into a universal language interpretable by any LLM, enabling direct fine-tuning without architectural changes and improving interpretability through bidirectional conversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current LLM-based ECG analysis including lack of transferability across models, difficulty capturing time-scale information due to Transformer constraints, and poor interpretability hindering clinical adoption.

Method: Develop ECG-aBcDe encoding that converts ECG signals into a universal ECG language, construct hybrid dataset of ECG language and natural language, enable bidirectional conversion between ECG signals and ECG language for attention heatmap extraction.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR, with significant improvements in BLEU-4 (2.8x and 3.9x improvements in in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, reaching 42.58 and 30.76 scores respectively).

Conclusion: ECG-aBcDe presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis with LLMs, demonstrating feasibility through strong performance metrics and addressing key limitations in transferability, time-scale learning, and interpretability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

TL;DR: AutoCO is the first end-to-end automated constraint optimization method that uses LLMs to generate constraint relaxation strategies for nonlinear combinatorial optimization problems, combining evolutionary algorithms and Monte Carlo Tree Search for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear combinatorial optimization problems are computationally challenging due to their nonconvex nature and multi-modal solution spaces. Traditional methods lack automation and scalability, while current LLM-based approaches only validate constraints rather than proactively designing strategies.

Method: Uses structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies with a unified triple-representation scheme. Implements a bidirectional coevolution mechanism combining Evolutionary Algorithms for local refinement and Monte Carlo Tree Search for global strategy space exploration.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP benchmarks demonstrate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance over baseline methods.

Conclusion: AutoCO revolutionizes NCOP resolution through learning to relax with LLMs, providing an automated and scalable approach that effectively handles sophisticated constraint interactions in nonlinear combinatorial optimization problems.

Abstract: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how frontier Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities evolve over time and develop a more computationally efficient approach to logical reasoning tasks.

Method: 1) Longitudinal evaluation of three leading models on PrOntoQA true/false questions with faithfulness to reasoning strategies 2) Neuro-symbolic architecture using <15B parameter LLMs to translate problems into standardized form, then parsed by Z3 SMT solver

Result: Performance improved from 2023 to 2024 due to hidden Chain of Thought prompting, and further improved 2024-2025 with thinking models. Neuro-symbolic approach maintained near-perfect performance while significantly reducing computational costs. FLOPs approximation was accurate within 10%.

Conclusion: LLM reasoning capabilities show steady improvement over time with better prompting techniques. Neuro-symbolic approaches offer computationally efficient alternatives that maintain high performance for logical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing methods that require extensive finetuning or predefined algorithms for graph reasoning tasks, providing a more flexible and efficient solution.

Method: Stores target graphs in graph databases, prompts LLMs to generate executable code queries for information retrieval, and incorporates an error feedback loop with time-out mechanism for correctness and efficiency.

Result: Achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks (cycle detection, bipartite checks, shortest path, max flow), maintains consistent token costs regardless of graph size, and scales to graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

Conclusion: GRRAF provides an effective, training-free framework for graph reasoning that leverages RAG and LLM code-generation capabilities, demonstrating high accuracy, scalability, and efficiency across various graph tasks.

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

TL;DR: Proposes hierarchical memory architecture with H2R mechanism for fine-grained knowledge transfer in LLM-based agents, improving generalization and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents treat prior knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained knowledge transfer across tasks.

Method: Hierarchical memory architecture decoupling high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory, with Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection (H2R) to distill reusable hierarchical knowledge from past interactions.

Result: Experimental results across two benchmarks show improved generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior baselines like Expel.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical memory approach enables more efficient and fine-grained knowledge transfer for LLM-based agents in multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

*Jiaqi Wang,Binquan Ji,Haibo Luo,Yiyang Qi,Ruiting Li,Huiyan Wang,Yuantao Han,Cangyi Yang,jiaxu Zhang,Feiliang Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LTA-Thinker is a novel framework that enhances complex reasoning in LLMs by improving Latent Thought distribution variance through learnable prior architecture and distribution-based optimization with semantic alignment and reasoning focus losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck in efficient generation and utilization of high-quality Latent Thoughts for complex reasoning, building on the insight that larger variance in Latent Thought distribution better approximates the golden truth distribution.

Method: Uses a learnable prior architecture to increase Latent Thought variance and introduces distribution-based directional optimization with Semantic Alignment Loss (KL divergence) and Reasoning Focus Loss (contrastive learning) combined with standard SFT loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among various baselines, demonstrating higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

Conclusion: LTA-Thinker effectively improves reasoning performance by enhancing Latent Thought distribution variance through architectural improvements and multi-objective optimization strategies.

Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with generating realistic random street addresses for European cities despite their general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether Large Language Models can generate plausible random street addresses, which requires understanding of geographic patterns and naming conventions.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on their ability to generate random street addresses for European cities, testing their understanding of real-world geographic patterns.

Result: LLMs performed poorly at generating realistic random street addresses, showing limitations in this specific domain despite broad capabilities.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant limitations in generating contextually accurate geographic information like street addresses, revealing gaps in their real-world knowledge representation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of solving complex math problems or
answer difficult questions on almost any topic, but can they generate random
street addresses for European cities?

*Jai Singla,Peal Jotania,Keivalya Pandya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deep learning approach using satellite imagery and DEM data to estimate urban population with high accuracy (F1-score 0.9936), eliminating need for traditional census methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional population estimation methods like surveys and censuses are expensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, requiring better automated solutions.

Method: Combines CNN for building classification (residential vs non-residential) and ANN for population estimation using high-resolution satellite imagery (0.3m), DEM data (0.5m), and vector boundaries.

Result: Achieved impressive F1-score of 0.9936 and estimated Gandhinagar population at 278,954 using approximately 48k building footprints.

Conclusion: The automated AI-driven framework provides municipalities with scalable, replicable tools for optimized resource management in rapidly urbanizing cities, overcoming limitations of conventional census methods.

Abstract: Population estimation is crucial for various applications, from resource
allocation to urban planning. Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses
are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high
resolution (0.3 m) satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of 0.5m
resolution and vector boundaries. Proposed method combines Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) architecture for classification task to classify buildings as
residential and non-residential and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over
Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and
non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level
population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall
F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis
with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By
integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure
planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations
of conventional census-based methodologies. The framework provides
municipalities with a scalable and replicable tool for optimized resource
management in rapidly urbanizing cities, showcasing the efficiency of AI-driven
geospatial analytics in enhancing data-driven urban governance.

*Jeremias Ferrao,Matthijs van der Lende,Ilija Lichkovski,Clement Neo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FSRL is a transparent alignment framework that uses lightweight adapters to steer LLM behavior through interpretable SAE features, achieving comparable results to RLHF while providing mechanistic insights into preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF methods induce opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to understand what models have internalized during alignment. There's a need for more transparent and interpretable alignment approaches.

Method: Feature Steering with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL) trains lightweight adapters to modulate interpretable features from Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to steer model behavior, providing a more transparent alternative to RLHF.

Result: FSRL demonstrates comparable effectiveness to current RLHF methods for preference optimization. Mechanistic analysis reveals the adapter systematically promotes style features over explicit alignment concepts, suggesting preference optimization rewards stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality.

Conclusion: FSRL provides a valuable tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the internal mechanisms of alignment, offering transparency while maintaining performance comparable to traditional RLHF approaches.

Abstract: Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

*Shilian Chen,Jie Zhou,Tianyu Huai,Yujiang Lu,Junsong Li,Bihao Zhan,Qianjun Pan,Yutao Yang,Xin Li,Qin Chen,Hang Yan,Liang He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evo-Merging: A derivative-free evolutionary optimization framework for black-box model merging of large language models using only API queries, featuring sparsity-based denoising and sign-aware scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods require access to model parameters, but large LLMs like GPT-4 are often available only as black-box services through APIs, making traditional approaches infeasible.

Method: Evolutionary algorithm-based optimization with two key components: sparsity-based denoising to filter irrelevant information, and sign-aware scaling to dynamically compute optimal combination weights using only inference-time API queries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines in black-box model merging scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Evo-Merging framework effectively addresses the black-box model merging challenge for massive LLMs, providing a practical solution that works with API-only access and demonstrates superior performance.

Abstract: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

### [34] [Forget What's Sensitive, Remember What Matters: Token-Level Differential Privacy in Memory Sculpting for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12958)
*Bihao Zhan,Jie Zhou,Junsong Li,Yutao Yang,Shilian Chen,Qianjun Pan,Xin Li,Wen Wu,Xingjiao Wu,Qin Chen,Hang Yan,Liang He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PeCL framework combines dynamic differential privacy and memory sculpting to protect sensitive data while preserving task knowledge in continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional uniform DP approaches degrade model utility in continual learning by applying equal protection to all data, failing to distinguish between sensitive and non-sensitive information.

Method: Token-level dynamic DP strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on semantic sensitivity, plus privacy-guided memory sculpting to forget sensitive information while preserving task-invariant knowledge.

Result: Superior balance between privacy preservation and model utility, outperforming baseline models with high accuracy on previous tasks while ensuring robust privacy protection.

Conclusion: PeCL effectively addresses privacy challenges in continual learning by selectively protecting sensitive information while maintaining model performance, enabling deployment in privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

*Yarin Benyamin,Argaman Mordoch,Shahaf S. Shperberg,Roni Stern*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Planning Copilot bridges LLMs' planning gap by integrating planning tools via MCP protocol, enabling natural language planning without domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack reliable long-horizon planning capabilities, limiting their effectiveness as autonomous agents for complex tasks.

Method: Developed Planning Copilot chatbot that uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect LLMs with external planning tools, supporting syntax checking, planner selection, plan validation, and execution simulation.

Result: Significantly outperforms same LLMs without planning tools and even beats GPT-5 despite using smaller LLMs, demonstrating superior planning task performance.

Conclusion: Dedicated planning tools integrated via protocols like MCP are an effective approach to enable LLMs to perform complex planning tasks reliably.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

*Shinichi Honna,Taichi Murayama,Akira Matsui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study tests the Anna Karenina Principle across different media types (novels, Wikipedia, research papers, movies) and finds that structural success patterns vary by medium, with failure taking diverse forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically test the Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) - which suggests success requires meeting essential conditions while failure has diverse forms - and its variations across different textual and media domains.

Method: Represented texts as sequences of functional blocks and assessed convergence in transition order and position across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies.

Result: Found medium-specific structural patterns: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered patterns, academic papers show reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in position, and movies diverge by genre.

Conclusion: Success depends on medium-specific structural constraints, while failure assumes different shapes across domains, confirming the context-dependent nature of structural principles.

Abstract: The Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) holds that success requires satisfying a
small set of essential conditions, whereas failure takes diverse forms. We test
AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are
represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in
transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different
shapes across domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent frameworks lack systematic evaluation for event organization and visualized integration with physically grounded environments, limiting realistic spatial navigation and item interaction capabilities.

Method: Developed MiniAgentPro visualization platform with intuitive map editor for environment customization and simulation player with smooth animations, plus comprehensive test set with 8 diverse event scenarios in basic and hard variants.

Result: Evaluations using GPT-4o show strong performance in basic settings but reveal coordination challenges in hard variants of the event scenarios.

Conclusion: MiniAgentPro provides a valuable tool for assessing LLM agents' capabilities in physically grounded environments, highlighting both strengths in basic scenarios and coordination difficulties in more complex situations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the simulation of agent
societies, enabling autonomous planning, memory formation, and social
interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook systematic
evaluations for event organization and lack visualized integration with
physically grounded environments, limiting agents' ability to navigate spaces

*Marylou Fauchard,Florian Carichon,Margarida Carvalho,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show promise in combinatorial optimization but struggle with matching problems like College Admission Problem, where reasoning models outperform traditional ones but no single prompting strategy works best consistently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel at mathematical reasoning, their application to matching problems with preferential and structural constraints remains underexplored, creating a need for systematic evaluation.

Method: Created a benchmark of 369 College Admission Problem instances to evaluate LLMs on feasibility, stability, and optimality. Tested various prompting strategies including Chain-of-Thought, In-Context Learning, and role-based prompting across multiple open-weight LLMs.

Result: LLMs can satisfy some constraints but struggle with all evaluation criteria consistently. Reasoning models (QwQ, GPT-oss) significantly outperform traditional models (Llama, Qwen, Mistral). Performance varies across prompting strategies with no consistently best approach. Iterative prompting shows non-monotonic performance that peaks early then declines.

Conclusion: This work provides new insights into LLM reasoning performance and prompting effectiveness for combinatorial optimization with preferential constraints, highlighting both capabilities and limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

*Kanishk Garg,Saranya D.,Sanal Kumar,Saurabh Singh,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes G-CSEA algorithm for efficient conflict set extraction in infeasible workforce scheduling models with pseudo-Boolean constraints, inspired by CDCL SAT solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IIS extraction methods require many solver calls and dual ray analysis fails for pseudo-Boolean models when relaxed problem is feasible but original is infeasible.

Method: Graph-based Conflict Set Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) constructs implication graph during constraint propagation and traces contributing constraints across decision branches upon conflict detection.

Result: Extracts conflict sets efficiently, which can be minimized using QuickXplain to produce Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs).

Conclusion: G-CSEA provides an effective approach for identifying minimal constraint sets causing infeasibility in workforce scheduling problems with complex rule interactions.

Abstract: Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

*Nadim Barakat,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs show promise for diabetic retinopathy screening and simulating clinical AI assistance, with MedGemma outperforming GPT-4o in baseline performance and stability, while GPT-4o achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FDA-cleared AI systems for diabetic retinopathy screening provide minimal binary referral outputs, which may limit clinical trust and utility. Determining the most effective output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge.

Method: Evaluated two MLLMs (GPT-4o and MedGemma) on IDRiD and Messidor-2 datasets through: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs.

Result: MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at baseline with higher sensitivity and AUROC. GPT-4o showed near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect inputs while MedGemma remained stable. In collaboration, GPT-4o achieved AUROC up to 0.96 when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs.

Conclusion: MLLMs may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for studying clinical AI assistance. Open models like MedGemma are valuable in low-resource settings, and descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician trust.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

Motivation: Current AI memory systems lack adaptability, multimodal integration, and continuous learning capabilities needed for artificial general intelligence (AGI) development.

Method: Scenario-driven methodology that extracts functional requirements from cognitive scenarios to establish design principles, resulting in the COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA) framework.

Result: Developed COLMA - a unified framework integrating cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms to support robust AI memory systems.

Conclusion: COLMA provides a structured foundation for developing AI systems with lifelong learning and human-like reasoning capabilities, contributing to practical AGI advancement.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence

increasingly evident. Current memory architectures often suffer from limited
adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support
continuous learning. To address these limitations, we propose a scenario-driven
methodology that extracts essential functional requirements from representative
cognitive scenarios, leading to a unified set of design principles for
next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the
\textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that
integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a
cohesive design. COLMA provides a structured foundation for developing AI
systems capable of lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, thereby

*Vincent Siu,Nathan W. Henry,Nicholas Crispino,Yang Liu,Dawn Song,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RepIt is a simple, data-efficient framework that isolates concept-specific representations in LLMs, enabling precise interventions to suppress refusal on targeted concepts while preserving safety elsewhere using minimal data and compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current activation steering methods in LLMs often have broader unintended effects than desired, motivating the need for purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand model behavior at a more granular level.

Method: RepIt framework isolates concept-specific representations by disentangling refusal vectors, requiring only 100-200 neurons and as few as a dozen examples to extract robust target representations on a single A6000 GPU.

Result: Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt successfully suppressed refusal on targeted concepts (like WMD-related questions) while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that still scored as safe on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization in LLMs and lays the foundation for more granular control of model behavior, though raises concerns about potential misuse due to the method's efficiency and data requirements.

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

TL;DR: Shapes of cognition is a new paradigm for modeling intelligent agents that uses remembered knowledge constellations to simplify real-world complexity through pattern recognition, analogy, and cognitive load minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create computational cognitive models for Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs) that can handle real-life complexity by leveraging typical patterns and minimizing cognitive effort, while providing explainable and trustworthy systems.

Method: Uses shapes - remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and procedural knowledge. Implements specific objectives, hypotheses, modeling strategies, and knowledge bases within a cognitive architecture framework.

Result: Develops a framework for building agent systems that can expect typical outcomes, recognize patterns, act by habit, reason by analogy, and handle atypical situations through recovery methods like on-the-fly learning or human assistance.

Conclusion: The shapes-based approach provides a specific yet broadly applicable modeling paradigm that can revitalize knowledge-based and hybrid AI systems, creating explainable, extensible, and trustworthy agents even for critical domains.

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.

### [44] [PowerGrow: Feasible Co-Growth of Structures and Dynamics for Power Grid Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12212)
*Xinyu He,Chenhan Xiao,Haoran Li,Ruizhong Qiu,Zhe Xu,Yang Weng,Jingrui He,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PowerGrow is a co-generative framework that synthesizes realistic power grid test cases with topology, branch attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles while maintaining physical feasibility and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern power systems face increasing dynamics from renewable energy variability and EV adoption, but publicly available test cases are scarce due to security concerns and anonymization efforts. There's a need for generative tools that can create realistic grid scenarios.

Method: Uses dependence decomposition to factorize the complex joint distribution into conditional distributions. Implements hierarchical graph beta-diffusion for structural synthesis and temporal autoencoder for time-series data embedding into compact latent space.

Result: Outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity, achieves 98.9% power flow convergence rate, and shows improved N-1 contingency resilience.

Conclusion: PowerGrow successfully generates operationally valid and realistic power grid scenarios with reduced computational overhead while maintaining physical feasibility.

Abstract: Modern power systems are becoming increasingly dynamic, with changing
topologies and time-varying loads driven by renewable energy variability,
electric vehicle adoption, and active grid reconfiguration. Despite these
changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns
and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations
call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal
dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch
attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major
challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive
computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that
significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational
validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint
distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over
feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,
leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at
each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for
structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds
time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability
and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow
not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also
achieves a 98.9\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency
resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and
realistic power grid scenarios.

### [45] [Scaling Up Data Parallelism in Decentralized Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12213)
*Bing Xie,Junqi Yin,Zhenyu Zhou,Sarp Oral,Feiyi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DBench benchmarking framework reveals decentralized learning scalability issues and parameter variance sensitivity. Proposed Ada adaptive approach achieves comparable accuracy to centralized training on 1008 GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized learning lacks production readiness due to stability, scalability, and generality issues in large-scale DNN training. This work aims to understand decentralized data parallel training at scale.

Method: Introduces DBench benchmarking framework to compare centralized and decentralized training. Uses benchmarking methodology to analyze correlations between model accuracy and parameter tensor variances across different communication graphs and training scales.

Result: Found that: (1) Decentralized training has scalability/generality issues like centralized; (2) Accuracy correlates with communication graph connections; (3) Accuracy is sensitive to parameter tensor variances. Ada adaptive approach achieves best convergence rates and comparable accuracy to centralized training on 1008 GPUs.

Conclusion: Ada decentralized adaptive approach successfully addresses scalability and accuracy challenges, making decentralized learning production-viable with performance matching centralized training even at extreme scales.

Abstract: Although it has been extensively explored in theory, decentralized learning
is not yet green-lighted for production use, largely due to a lack of
stability, scalability, and generality in large scale DNN training. To shed
light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies
decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a
benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and
decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking
methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the
variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training
scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to
centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the
issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model
accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections
in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is
surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model
replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive
approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD
method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout
training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada
can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN
training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample
applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for
ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.

*Xin Tong,Zhi Lin,Jingya Wang,Meng Han,Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEUV framework creates topic-specific unlock vectors to bypass LLM safety filters for legitimate high-stakes applications while minimizing cross-topic leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety alignment blocks both malicious and legitimate requests in security-sensitive domains like policing and defense, requiring a more fine-grained control approach.

Method: Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV) factorizes refusal direction into topic-aligned orthogonal vectors using multi-task objective with differential-ablation margin, cross-topic penalties, and orthogonality constraints.

Result: Achieves 87%+ attack success rate on multiple models while reducing cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared to single-direction baselines, with language-agnostic transfer between Chinese and English.

Conclusion: Fine-grained topic-level capability activation is achievable with minimal utility loss, enabling controlled LLM deployment in security-sensitive domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enforce safety alignment to reliably refuse
malicious requests, yet the same blanket safeguards also block legitimate uses
in policing, defense, and other high-stakes settings. Earlier
"refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single
vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic
control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight
framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned,
nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is
learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a
differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and
several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV
achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B,
and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best
single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged
to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace.
The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is
achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs
deployment in security-sensitive domains.

*Binquan Guo,Junteng Cao,Marie Siew,Binbin Chen,Tony Q. S. Quek,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a scheduling framework for federated learning over satellite networks to overcome bandwidth limitations and dynamic topology challenges, achieving 14-41% reduction in training round times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale LEO satellite systems enable collaborative AI training but face privacy constraints that prevent raw data aggregation. Federated learning preserves privacy but suffers from slow parameter exchange due to satellite network limitations.

Method: Discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning parameter exchange.

Result: Simulations show 14.20% to 41.48% reduction in overall training round times compared to traditional statistical multiplexing strategies, with better scalability for larger models and more clients.

Conclusion: The proposed scheduling framework effectively addresses satellite network bottlenecks for federated learning, demonstrating significant performance improvements and scalability advantages.

Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued
for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby
facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models
across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and
regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be
centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training
methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training
local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters.
However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will
hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged
training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of
scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key
bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose
a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically
allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange
strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the
acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher
numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

*Parsa Vatani,Mohamed Elrefaie,Farhad Nazarpour,Faez Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TripOptimizer is a differentiable deep learning framework using triplane-based VAE for rapid aerodynamic shape optimization from point cloud data, achieving up to 11.8% drag reduction without traditional CFD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFD-based aerodynamic optimization is computationally expensive, limiting design space exploration. There's a need for faster methods that can handle imperfect geometries.

Method: Uses Variational Autoencoder with triplane-based implicit neural representation for 3D geometry reconstruction and drag prediction. Trained on DrivAerNet++ dataset (8,000 vehicle geometries with CFD-computed drag). Optimization modifies encoder parameters to steer geometry toward target drag.

Result: Achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8%. Results validated with independent high-fidelity CFD simulations using 150+ million cells. Framework handles non-watertight meshes robustly.

Conclusion: Enables agile aerodynamic optimization workflow, reduces reliance on computationally intensive CFD, especially valuable for early design stages with imperfect geometries.

Abstract: The computational cost of traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics-based
Aerodynamic Shape Optimization severely restricts design space exploration.
This paper introduces TripOptimizer, a fully differentiable deep learning
framework for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization directly from
vehicle point cloud data. TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder
featuring a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D
geometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on
DrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with
corresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes
aerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy
that modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry
towards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where
optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\%. These
results were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity
Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A
key advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to
geometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a
significant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods. The framework
enables a more agile Aerodynamic Shape Optimization workflow, reducing reliance
on computationally intensive CFD simulations, especially during early design
stages.

*Aiping Zhong,Baike She,Philip E. Par√©*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A PINN-based MPC framework for SIR epidemic models that jointly estimates states and parameters in real-time using only noisy infected state data, with novel algorithms for different knowledge assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MPC approaches for epidemic control either assume measurable states with learned parameters or known parameters with learned states, but not joint estimation of both from limited noisy data.

Method: Proposes MPC-PINNs framework with three novel algorithms: 1) MPC-PINNs for controlled SIR models, 2) MPC-LS-PINNs with log-scaled loss for noise robustness, and 3) MPC-SI-PINNs using integral operators and state coupling. Extended for different knowledge assumptions about recovery rate or basic reproduction number.

Result: The framework successfully estimates epidemic states and parameters simultaneously while generating optimal control strategies, demonstrating effectiveness under various settings through experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed PINN-based MPC framework provides an effective solution for joint real-time state and parameter estimation in epidemic control using only noisy infected state data, with robust performance under different knowledge assumptions.

Abstract: This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model
predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$)
spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often
assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are
learned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In
this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters
within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption
that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction
number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel
PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we
introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then
propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss
function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral
PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in
the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete
epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our
framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and
extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs
(MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we
simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating
optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods under different settings.

TL;DR: A unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask multimodal prediction that dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies per sample, particularly useful for psychotherapy applications with heterogeneous data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data heterogeneity and task interactions in psychotherapy applications where structured assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with missing data and correlated outcomes.

Method: Routing-based architecture with multiple modality paths (raw and fused text/numeric representations) that learns to route inputs through optimal expert combinations, with task-specific predictions from shared/independent heads based on routing decisions, trained end-to-end.

Result: Outperforms fixed multitask and single-task baselines on synthetic and real-world psychotherapy data for depression/anxiety prediction, with learned routing providing interpretable insights into modality relevance and task structure.

Conclusion: Enables per-subject adaptive information processing for personalized healthcare, potentially improving mental health outcomes, treatment precision, and cost-effectiveness through personalized intervention strategies.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal
prediction settings where data heterogeneity and task interactions vary across
samples. Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured
assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing
data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that
dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on
a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw
and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each
input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific
predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the
routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the
model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting
depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method
consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the
learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance
and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized
healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that
accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to
psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance
treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness
through personalized intervention strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA and QLoRA on consumer-grade GPUs with strict 8GB VRAM limits, which remains underexplored despite enabling adaptation of foundation models on modest hardware.

Method: Controlled profiling study using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on NVIDIA RTX 4060, systematically varying batch size, sequence length, optimizer choice (AdamW vs. PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs. bf16). Measured throughput, time per 10k tokens, VRAM footprint, and energy estimates.

Result: Paged optimizers improved throughput by up to 25% (628 tok/s vs. 500 tok/s baseline), bf16 degraded efficiency relative to fp16, and sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible despite 8GB constraints.

Conclusion: First systematic case study providing reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for LLM fine-tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs, demonstrating that parameter-efficient strategies enable fine-tuning even under strict 8GB VRAM limitations.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with parameter-efficient techniques
such as LoRA and QLoRA has enabled adaptation of foundation models on modest
hardware. Yet the efficiency of such training on consumer-grade GPUs,
especially under strict 8 GB VRAM limits, remains underexplored. We present a
controlled profiling study of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning using the
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060. Across three
representative configurations, we systematically vary batch size, sequence
length, optimizer choice (AdamW vs. PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs. bf16).
We report throughput (tokens/s), time per 10k tokens, and VRAM footprint,
alongside energy estimates derived from GPU board power limits. Our results
show that paged optimizers improve throughput by up to 25% (628 tok/s vs. 500
tok/s baseline), while bf16 degrades efficiency relative to fp16. Despite 8 GB
constraints, sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible using
parameter-efficient strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
case study of LLM fine-tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs, providing
reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for resource-constrained

*Benjamin Burns,Yuan Xue,Douglas W. Scharre,Xia Ning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PerM-MoE is a novel multimodal Alzheimer's disease progression prediction method that uses independent routers for each neuroimaging modality to handle high modality missingness during inference, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models for Alzheimer's disease progression prediction fail to make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, which is common in clinical settings.

Method: PerM-MoE uses a sparse mixture-of-experts approach with independent routers for each modality (T1-weighted MRI, FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, tau PET) instead of a single conventional router, increasing flexibility under modality missingness.

Result: PerM-MoE outperforms state-of-the-art Flex-MoE and unimodal models in most variations of modality missingness for predicting two-year CDR-SB score changes, and demonstrates more effective expert utilization than Flex-MoE.

Conclusion: The proposed PerM-MoE method effectively addresses the challenge of modality missingness in clinical settings and provides superior performance for Alzheimer's disease progression prediction compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high
inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction
aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating
multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to
make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as
is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model
flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel
sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each
modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,
FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art
Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of
modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most
variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of
experts than Flex-MoE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stage fine-tuning (SFT+RL) outperforms one-stage SFT, but the mechanism is misunderstood. SFT causes OOD forgetting, RL restores lost ability, and singular vector rotation (not singular values) drives performance changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the evolution and mechanisms behind the synergy of SFT and RL in two-stage fine-tuning, challenging the oversimplified claim that 'SFT memorizes, RL generalizes'.

Method: Analyzed SFT and RL stages, employed SVD analysis on parameter matrices, manually edited parameters, and observed impacts on model performance across different training durations.

Result: Found OOD performance peaks early in SFT then declines; RL restores lost OOD ability rather than generating new capability; recovery has boundaries; singular vector rotation (not singular value changes) correlates strongly with OOD behavior.

Conclusion: Re-identified SFT's role in causing OOD forgetting and RL's role in restoration, with singular vector rotation as the key mechanism driving performance changes in two-stage fine-tuning.

Abstract: The two-stage fine-tuning paradigm of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed
by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empirically shown better reasoning
performance than one-stage SFT for the post-training of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL
are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known
claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that:
(1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD
forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss;
(2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD
capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the
lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries,
\ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the
lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the
forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter
matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance.
Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from
the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable
throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the
\textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of
SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular
vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which
shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions
onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation. Code is available at

*Changqing Liu,Kaining Dai,Zhiwei Zhao,Tianyi Wu,Yingguang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel neural diffeomorphic-neural operator (NDNO) framework is proposed to efficiently predict machining deformation in structural components with varying geometries by mapping complex 3D shapes to a common reference domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of machining deformation is crucial for dimensional precision, but conventional numerical methods are computationally expensive, especially for diverse geometries. Neural operators show promise but face limitations when applied across changing geometric domains.

Method: A diffeomorphic neural network maps complex 3D geometries to a common reference domain with smoothness and invertibility constraints. A neural operator is then trained on this reference domain to learn deformation fields induced by residual stresses.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy and efficiency in predicting both main-direction and multi-direction deformation fields across parts with diverse geometries, including different component types, dimensions, and features.

Conclusion: The NDNO framework provides an effective and computationally efficient solution for deformation prediction in structural components with varying geometries, enabling rapid adaptation to different shapes while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is
essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation
often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence
vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods
for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are
computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.
Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently
solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in
accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct
application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical
limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on
diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural
operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are
explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural
network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is
then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of
deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the
diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient
prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The
proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying
geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and
multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency
across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and
features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Improved association rule mining with SHAP-inspired metrics to identify clinical indicators for preoperative diagnosis of follicular thyroid cancer, revealing novel malignant associations beyond traditional ultrasound signs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Follicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is harder to diagnose preoperatively than papillary thyroid cancer, with fewer established clinical studies. The study aims to identify clinical indications to aid preoperative diagnosis.

Method: Retrospective analysis of 1673 cases (2010-2023) using improved association rule mining with novel analytical metrics inspired by SHAP method from interpretable machine learning to measure malignant associations between clinical indications and cancer.

Result: Identified strong malignant associations beyond common indicators, including nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern, low TSH scores, and combination with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Dataset contained 1414 benign and 259 malignant nodes.

Conclusion: Multiple clinical indications should be considered for accurate preoperative diagnosis of follicular thyroid cancer. The identified diverse malignant associations can serve as reference for clinicians in thyroid cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Purpose: Thyroid cancer has been a common cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer
and follicular thyroid cancer are the two most common types of thyroid cancer.
Follicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is more
difficult to diagnose preoperatively than the more prevalent papillary thyroid
cancer, and the clinical studies associated with it are less well established.
We aimed to analyze the clinical data of follicular thyroid cancer based on a
novel data mining tool to identify some clinical indications that may help in
preoperative diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis based on
case data collected by the Department of General Surgery of Peking University
Third Hospital between 2010 and 2023. Unlike traditional statistical methods,
we improved the association rule mining, a classical data mining method, and
proposed new analytical metrics reflecting the malignant association between
clinical indications and cancer with the help of the idea of SHAP method in
interpretable machine learning. Results: The dataset was preprocessed to
contain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were
benign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition
to some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven
thickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong
malignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern,
and low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of
Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association.
Conclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular
thyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more
accurate diagnosis. The diverse malignant associations identified in our study
may serve as a reference for clinicians in related fields.

Abstract: This work introduces InJecteD, a framework for interpreting Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by analyzing sample trajectories during
the denoising process of 2D point cloud generation. We apply this framework to

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JEPA with auxiliary regression head prevents representation collapse in deterministic MDPs - non-equivalent observations must map to distinct latents when both losses reach zero.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is widely used but poorly understood, particularly regarding representation collapse and the role of auxiliary tasks.

Method: Theoretical analysis of a simple JEPA variant with auxiliary regression head trained jointly with latent dynamics, plus controlled ablations in a counting environment.

Result: Proved No Unhealthy Representation Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, zero loss ensures distinct latents for non-equivalent observations. Joint training produces richer representations than separate training.

Conclusion: Auxiliary tasks anchor which distinctions representations must preserve, indicating a path to improve JEPA encoders by choosing auxiliary functions that encode the right equivalence relations with transition dynamics.

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for
visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its
behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization
of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head
trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation
Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the
latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero,
then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the
same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent
representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the
representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment
corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the
auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately.
Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an
auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the
right equivalence relations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial institutions need scalable tools for analyzing complex transactional networks, but traditional graph embedding methods struggle with dynamic, real-world banking data.

Method: Constructed transaction network using anonymised customer/merchant data and trained GraphSAGE model to generate node embeddings, then applied to money mule detection classification.

Result: Embeddings revealed interpretable clusters aligned with geographic/demographic attributes, and improved prioritization of high-risk accounts in fraud detection.

Conclusion: GraphSAGE framework is adaptable to banking-scale networks with strong inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability, providing a blueprint for financial organizations.

Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex
transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with
dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical
application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to
non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context.
Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can
generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with
temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network
using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model
to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals
interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes.
Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by
applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings
improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our
work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks,
emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This
study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine
learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a new explanation for the scaled-dot-product and softmax functions in transformer architectures through probabilistic modeling.

Method: Model value, key, and query vectors as Gaussian distributions where variance depends on time step, key vector, and query vector, while mean depends on time step and value vector.

Result: The analysis offers an alternative probabilistic interpretation of transformer attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: This maximum likelihood approach provides a novel explanation for transformer attention functions, complementing existing maximum entropy approaches in NLP.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood estimation approach to
determine the value vector in transformer models. We model the sequence of
value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian
distributions. The variance in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time
step, the corresponding key vector, and the query vector. The mean value in
each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, and the corresponding
value vector. This analysis may offer a new explanation of the
scaled-dot-product function or softmax function used in transformer
architectures [1]. Another explanation, inspired by [4], is based on the
maximum entropy approach in natural language processing [5]. In this approach,
a query vector and key vectors are used to derive the feature functions for the
maximum entropy model.

Conclusion: Quantum computing integration in financial forecasting shows significant potential advantages in speed and precision over traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Quantum Generative Adversarial

offer a novel approach by combining the strengths of generative models with

TL;DR: C3DE uses neural controlled differential equations with causal awareness to improve long-term urban crowd flow prediction by addressing multi-timescale asynchronous dynamics and spurious correlations between crowd flow and POI evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term urban crowd flow prediction suffers from cumulative sampling errors and the challenge of modeling multi-timescale asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distribution with latent spurious causality.

Method: Proposes Causal-aware Collaborative neural CDE (C3DE) with dual-path NCDE backbone to capture asynchronous evolution, dynamic correction mechanism with counterfactual-based causal effect estimator, and predictor for fused collaborative signals.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance, particularly in cities with notable flow fluctuations.

Conclusion: C3DE effectively addresses long-term urban crowd flow prediction challenges by modeling asynchronous dynamics and minimizing spurious correlations through causal-aware collaborative learning.

Abstract: Long-term urban crowd flow prediction suffers significantly from cumulative
sampling errors, due to increased sequence lengths and sampling intervals,
which inspired us to leverage Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs)
to mitigate this issue. However, regarding the crucial influence of Points of
Interest (POIs) evolution on long-term crowd flow, the multi-timescale
asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distribution, coupled with
latent spurious causality, poses challenges to applying NCDEs for long-term
urban crowd flow prediction. To this end, we propose Causal-aware Collaborative
neural CDE (C3DE) to model the long-term dynamic of crowd flow. Specifically,
we introduce a dual-path NCDE as the backbone to effectively capture the
asynchronous evolution of collaborative signals across multiple time scales.
Then, we design a dynamic correction mechanism with the counterfactual-based
causal effect estimator to quantify the causal impact of POIs on crowd flow and
minimize the accumulation of spurious correlations. Finally, we leverage a
predictor for long-term prediction with the fused collaborative signals of POI
and crowd flow. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of C3DE, particularly in cities with notable flow
fluctuations.

### [65] [Spontaneous Kolmogorov-Arnold Geometry in Shallow MLPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12326)
*Michael Freedman,Michael Mulligan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) geometry emerges organically when training single hidden layer neural networks, rather than being engineered into the architecture like in KANs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural networks naturally learn to prepare input data for downstream processing and to identify when KA geometry emerges to potentially accelerate learning through hyperparameter adjustments.

Method: Quantify KA geometry through statistical properties of the exterior powers of the Jacobian matrix J(x), including zero row counts and minor statistics that measure scale and axis alignment as x varies over data.

Result: KA geometry often emerges when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks, and the research provides understanding of where this occurs in function complexity and hyperparameter space.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that Kolmogorov-Arnold geometry can organically emerge in conventional neural network training, representing the 'flip side' of engineered KA-Networks (KANs).

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but
highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single
(non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a
distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the
inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the
data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through
conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often
is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We
quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers
of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor
statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of
$J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry
occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The
motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to
prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough
about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely
intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of
KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather
watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.

Motivation: To address the challenge of dynamic pricing and inventory management for perishable goods, aiming to maximize profitability while reducing food waste in supermarket operations.

Method: Uses LSTM network with attention mechanism to predict sales volumes, pricing trends, and spoilage rates over 7 days, then applies Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with cost-plus pricing to optimize replenishment strategies.

Result: The framework successfully maximizes profits while adhering to inventory constraints, reduces food waste, and provides interpretable insights through attention mechanism for better decision-making.

Conclusion: This integrated approach bridges predictive modeling with optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and inventory management in perishable goods retail.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing pricing and replenishment
strategies in fresh food supermarkets by combining Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The LSTM model,
enhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing
trends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated
by the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively
optimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while
adhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows
for dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time
adaptability to market fluctuations. The framework not only maximizes profits
but also reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable supermarket
operations. The attention mechanism enhances the interpretability of the LSTM
model by identifying key time points and factors influencing sales, improving
decision-making accuracy. This methodology bridges the gap between predictive
modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and
inventory management in fresh food retail and other industries dealing with
perishable goods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DeepONets with fully connected linear layers in trunk networks have limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent in various PDEs.

Method: Introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks within DeepONet architecture using random Fourier feature mappings to enrich spatial representation capabilities.

Result: FEDONet demonstrates superior performance across multiple PDE datasets with average relative L2 performance gains of 2-3x compared to traditional DeepONet baseline.

Conclusion: Fourier embeddings effectively enhance neural operator learning, providing a robust and broadly applicable methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful
data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited
for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite
their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which
typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can
encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to
various PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks
within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to
enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded
DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional
DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the
two-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic
system, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
and the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show
significant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average
relative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet
baseline. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in
enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable
methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.

TL;DR: PCA and LDA methods for dimensionality reduction of word embeddings in tabular data classification, with Partitioned-LDA achieving top performance on salary prediction challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifying salary categories using tabular data with high-dimensional word embeddings is challenging due to limited training samples and underexplored linear dimensionality reduction techniques for this context.

Method: Studied PCA and LDA for dimensionality reduction of 300D word embeddings. Proposed Partitioned-LDA which splits embeddings into blocks and performs LDA separately on each to handle covariance estimation issues. Applied shrinkage regularization to improve LDA performance.

Result: PCA with appropriate subspace dimension outperformed raw embeddings. Regular LDA performed poorly but shrinkage significantly improved it. Partitioned-LDA outperformed regular LDA and achieved top-10 accuracy on competition leaderboard.

Conclusion: Partitioned-LDA with shrinkage effectively enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited training samples, providing a practical solution for high-dimensional feature reduction.

Abstract: The Engineers' Salary Prediction Challenge requires classifying salary
categories into three classes based on tabular data. The job description is
represented as a 300-dimensional word embedding incorporated into the tabular
features, drastically increasing dimensionality. Additionally, the limited
number of training samples makes classification challenging. Linear
dimensionality reduction of word embeddings for tabular data classification
remains underexplored. This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We show that PCA, with an appropriate
subspace dimension, can outperform raw embeddings. LDA without regularization
performs poorly due to covariance estimation errors, but applying shrinkage
improves performance significantly, even with only two dimensions. We propose
Partitioned-LDA, which splits embeddings into equal-sized blocks and performs
LDA separately on each, thereby reducing the size of the covariance matrices.
Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, combined with shrinkage, achieves
top-10 accuracy on the competition public leaderboard. This method effectively
enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited
training samples.

TL;DR: MEAGraph is an unsupervised graph autoencoder model that uses multi-kernel edge attention to analyze atomic datasets, enabling effective identification and pruning of oversampled regions in potential energy surfaces without requiring labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dataset generation techniques in computational chemistry often oversample regions of potential energy surfaces, creating biased datasets that hinder training of generalizable force fields. Existing clustering and pruning methods struggle with high-dimensional atomic descriptors and can lead to information loss.

Method: The Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) combines multiple linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture geometric sensitivity. This unsupervised approach groups similar atomic environments without relying on labels or extensive training.

Result: MEAGraph successfully groups similar atomic environments in niobium, tantalum, and iron datasets, allowing basic pruning techniques to effectively remove sampling bias. The model provides efficient representation learning and clustering for data analysis.

Conclusion: MEAGraph offers an effective unsupervised method for analyzing atomic datasets, enabling systematic removal of sampling bias through intelligent clustering and pruning. This approach supports better dataset optimization for training more generalizable force fields in computational chemistry.

Abstract: Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is
critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in
computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation
techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface.
Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each
other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to
systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and
pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead
to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the
potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high
dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the
Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an
unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple
linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture
geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on
labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum,
and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic
environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing
sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation
learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection,
and dataset optimization.

Motivation: Address the need for data-driven agricultural decision-making while respecting farm data privacy concerns and providing secure, efficient disease detection solutions.

Method: Data collection from Minnesota farms, local deep learning algorithms, transfer learning, and central aggregation server for model refinement in a federated learning framework.

Result: Anticipates improved disease detection accuracy, good generalization across scenarios, lower communication/training costs, and earlier disease identification (requires empirical validation).

Conclusion: Bridges advanced ML techniques with practical privacy needs of farmers, offering a secure federated learning approach that could revolutionize smart farming while maintaining data confidentiality.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation with the integration

work proposes a federated learning framework for smart farming, aiming to
develop a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for crop disease detection
tailored to the environmental and operational conditions of Minnesota farms. By
maintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model
updates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease
classification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology
involving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep
learning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for
model refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,
good generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication
and training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases
in future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,
setting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work
comes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations
in agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that
are hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide
a secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize
smart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data
confidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced
machine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of
farmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning.

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised LSTM autoencoder with dual attention mechanism for anomaly detection and localization in nuclear reactor radiation monitoring systems, using real-world data from PUR-1 research reactor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-generation nuclear reactors produce large volumes of multivariate time-series data that could enable enhanced monitoring and control. However, existing ML/DL approaches lack explainability, access to real-world data, and ability to handle scarce abnormal events, which is critical for safety-critical nuclear applications.

Method: Unsupervised methodology using LSTM autoencoder with dual attention mechanism (feature attention and time attention). Feature attention assigns weights to abnormal radiation sensors, while time attention highlights irregular timesteps, enabling both detection and localization of anomalies within a single unified network.

Result: Framework evaluated using real-world datasets of increasing complexity from PUR-1 research reactor. The dual attention mechanism successfully identifies both affected sensors and duration of each anomaly, providing comprehensive characterization of abnormal events.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses key challenges in nuclear anomaly detection by providing interpretable results through attention mechanisms, using real-world reactor data, and enabling both detection and localization capabilities essential for autonomous control systems in nuclear applications.

Abstract: The nuclear industry is advancing toward more new reactor designs, with
next-generation reactors expected to be smaller in scale and power output.
These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the
form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced
real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote
autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained
significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate
diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the
reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for
anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key
challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to
real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking
and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes,
while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL
outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised
methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for
characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area
monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also
localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of
increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms
operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature
attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns,
while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities
occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can
identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a
single unified network.

TL;DR: DDPMs for generating realistic automotive time series data and correcting corrupted samples in small datasets


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep learning on small time series datasets with corrupted samples is challenging, and diffusion models show promise for generating realistic synthetic data and imputation

Method: Hybrid generative approach combining autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques with improved DDPM architectures for time series generation

Result: Best model outperformed training data in physical correctness while showing plausible driving behavior, and successfully imputed physically implausible regions

Conclusion: DDPMs are effective for generating realistic automotive time series data and improving data quality through imputation of corrupted samples

Abstract: Training deep learning methods on small time series datasets that also
include corrupted samples is challenging. Diffusion models have shown to be
effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted
samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating
synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this
task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data
and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative
approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We
evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time
series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the
generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness
and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the
training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving
behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically
implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.

*Mohamed Zayaan S*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSML is a meta-learning framework that learns causal structure from task distributions, enabling robust few-shot adaptation and causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models rely on spurious correlations and require massive datasets, while humans achieve robust learning through causal understanding.

Method: Three modules: perception (input to symbolic representations), differentiable causal induction (discovers causal graph), and graph-based reasoning (makes predictions using causal graph). Meta-learns shared causal world model across tasks.

Result: Dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, especially on tasks requiring true causal inference.

Conclusion: CSML demonstrates that learning causal structure enables sample-efficient, robust adaptation to novel tasks including interventions and counterfactuals.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but remain
fundamentally limited by their reliance on spurious correlations, leading to
poor generalization and a demand for massive datasets. We argue that a key
ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems
from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce
Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer
the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key
modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic
representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the
underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning
module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared
causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to
novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and
counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a
new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our
experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art
meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding
true causal inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D printing has shifted from professional/enthusiast use to broader consumer market, but current slicing software has limited sanity checking capabilities. New users often struggle with print failures from problematic geometries.

Method: Training an AI model to analyze 3D models and identify features that are likely to cause printing issues due to difficult geometries.

Conclusion: This AI-based approach provides valuable pre-print validation that can help inexperienced users avoid costly and frustrating print failures, making 3D printing more accessible to a wider audience.

Abstract: 3D printing has long been a technology for industry professionals and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Forward-Forward algorithms suffer from limited representational capacity and poor scalability due to exploding channel dimensionality, especially in convolutional neural networks.

Method: Proposes adaptive spatial goodness encoding (ASGE) that leverages feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness representations at each layer, enabling layer-wise supervision and decoupling classification complexity from channel dimensionality.

Result: Outperforms all other FF-based approaches: 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, 65.42% on CIFAR-100, and first successful FF-based training on ImageNet with 26.21% Top-1 and 47.49% Top-5 accuracy.

Conclusion: ASGE framework establishes a viable foundation for scalable BP-free CNN training by entirely eliminating backpropagation and significantly narrowing the performance gap with BP-trained models.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a promising alternative to
backpropagation (BP). Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which
have enhanced the original algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational capacity and
poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel
dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding
(ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE leverages
feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness representations at each layer,
enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples
classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the
issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to
other BP-free methods. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across
multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on
FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100. Moreover, we present
the first successful application of FF-based training to ImageNet, with Top-1
and Top-5 accuracies of 26.21% and 47.49%. By entirely eliminating BP and
significantly narrowing the performance gap with BP-trained models, the ASGE
framework establishes a viable foundation toward scalable BP-free CNN training.

TL;DR: Bayesian parametric matrix models (B-PMMs) extend spectral learning methods to provide uncertainty quantification while preserving computational efficiency and spectral structure, addressing limitations of deterministic approaches in safety-critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spectral learning methods only provide point estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in safety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential. Parametric matrix models lack uncertainty estimates despite their strong performance.

Method: B-PMMs use adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized matrix perturbation bounds, structured variational inference with manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian constraints, and provide finite-sample calibration guarantees.

Result: Experimental validation across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 shows perfect convergence rates, exceptional uncertainty calibration (ECE < 0.05), favorable scaling, and graceful degradation under spectral ill-conditioning with reliable estimates even in near-degenerate regimes.

Conclusion: B-PMMs provide a principled framework for robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains and lay the groundwork for broader Bayesian spectral machine learning by successfully quantifying uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning increasingly uses spectral methods to understand
physical systems. Current spectral learning approaches provide only point
estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in
safety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential.
Parametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine
learning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations.
However, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty
quantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models
(B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty
estimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational
efficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying
uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail
due to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical
contributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized
matrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty
propagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using
manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian
constraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit
dependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning. Experimental validation
across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 with perfect convergence rates
demonstrates that B-PMMs achieve exceptional uncertainty calibration (ECE <
0.05) while maintaining favorable scaling. The framework exhibits graceful
degradation under spectral ill-conditioning and provides reliable uncertainty
estimates even in near-degenerate regimes. The proposed framework supports
robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains and lays the
groundwork for broader Bayesian spectral machine learning.

TL;DR: SRI is a new method that reduces standard errors by over 50% in ML-based data annotation by learning low-dimensional representations that satisfy surrogate assumptions, even with imperfect human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for correcting bias in machine learning annotations yield large standard errors and require error-free human annotation, which limits their practical applicability.

Method: Proposes Surrogate Representation Inference (SRI) with a neural network architecture that learns low-dimensional representations of unstructured data while maintaining surrogate assumptions, and handles non-differential measurement errors in human annotations.

Result: Simulation studies and real-world applications show SRI reduces standard errors by over 50% when ML prediction accuracy is moderate and provides valid inference even with measurement errors in human annotations.

Conclusion: SRI offers a robust framework for improving statistical inference in ML-based data annotation tasks by leveraging surrogate representations and handling imperfect human annotations effectively.

Abstract: As researchers increasingly rely on machine learning models and LLMs to
annotate unstructured data, such as texts or images, various approaches have
been proposed to correct bias in downstream statistical analysis. However,
existing methods tend to yield large standard errors and require some
error-free human annotation. In this paper, I introduce Surrogate
Representation Inference (SRI), which assumes that unstructured data fully
mediate the relationship between human annotations and structured variables.
The assumption is guaranteed by design provided that human coders rely only on
unstructured data for annotation. Under this setting, I propose a neural
network architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of
unstructured data such that the surrogate assumption remains to be satisfied.
When multiple human annotations are available, SRI can further correct
non-differential measurement errors that may exist in human annotations.
Focusing on text-as-outcome settings, I formally establish the identification
conditions and semiparametric efficient estimation strategies that enable
learning and leveraging such a low-dimensional representation. Simulation
studies and a real-world application demonstrate that SRI reduces standard
errors by over 50% when machine learning prediction accuracy is moderate and
provides valid inference even when human annotations contain non-differential
measurement errors.

### [78] [On the Regularity and Fairness of Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12457)
*Xiaoyi Wu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A combinatorial multi-armed bandit algorithm that combines fairness guarantees, reward regularity, and cumulative reward maximization using virtual queues, TSLR metrics, and UCB estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address critical wireless network applications requiring not only cumulative reward maximization but also fairness among arms (minimum average rewards) and reward regularity (frequency of rewards).

Method: Propose a parameterized regular and fair learning algorithm that linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking fairness violations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics (capturing reward regularity), and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) estimates for exploration-exploitation balance.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows zero cumulative fairness violation, guaranteed reward regularity, and bounded cumulative regret performance. Results are verified through simulations using two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully achieves all three objectives (cumulative reward maximization, fairness guarantees, and reward regularity) in combinatorial multi-armed bandit problems with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit model is designed to maximize cumulative
rewards in the presence of uncertainty by activating a subset of arms in each
round. This paper is inspired by two critical applications in wireless
networks, where it's not only essential to maximize cumulative rewards but also
to guarantee fairness among arms (i.e., the minimum average reward required by
each arm) and ensure reward regularity (i.e., how often each arm receives the
reward). In this paper, we propose a parameterized regular and fair learning
algorithm to achieve these three objectives. In particular, the proposed
algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness
violations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) estimates in its weight measure. Here, TSLR is similar to
age-of-information and measures the elapsed number of rounds since the last
time an arm received a reward, capturing the reward regularity performance, and
UCB estimates are utilized to balance the tradeoff between exploration and
exploitation in online learning. By exploring a key relationship between
virtual queue-lengths and TSLR metrics and utilizing several non-trivial
Lyapunov functions, we analytically characterize zero cumulative fairness
violation, reward regularity, and cumulative regret performance under our
proposed algorithm. These theoretical outcomes are verified by simulations
based on two real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) to extend NTK theory to non-smooth functions and non-differentiable models by replacing local gradients with nonlocal interaction-based approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard Neural Tangent Kernel framework assumes differentiability, which breaks down for non-smooth target functions and models with non-differentiable behavior, limiting its applicability.

Method: Develops a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel that uses nonlocal interaction-based approximations instead of local gradients, with both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of the nonlocal operator.

Result: Enables NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth functions, stochastic estimators, and broader model families, demonstrated through numerical studies.

Conclusion: The NNTK framework successfully generalizes NTK theory beyond differentiable settings, making it applicable to a wider range of practical scenarios involving non-smooth functions and non-differentiable models.

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework has provided deep insights into the
training dynamics of neural networks under gradient flow. However, it relies on
the assumption that the network is differentiable with respect to its
parameters, an assumption that breaks down when considering non-smooth target
functions or parameterized models exhibiting non-differentiable behavior. In
this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the
local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter
space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions
than the standard gradient. This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth
functions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore
both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator.
We illustrate the new formulation with numerical studies.

TL;DR: Comparison of BEM and PINNs for solving 2D Helmholtz equation in wave scattering. PINNs show 42x longer training time but 204x faster evaluation than BEM at comparable accuracy, though BEM maintains better generalization outside training domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the performance of Boundary Element Method (BEM) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation in wave scattering problems under identical conditions.

Method: Both methods solve the same scattering problem - BEM using boundary discretization and PINNs by minimizing residual of governing equations and boundary conditions with hyperparameter optimization. Evaluation includes solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.

Result: PINNs required training times ~42 times longer than BEM but achieved evaluation times up to 204 times faster at comparable accuracy. However, PINNs showed poor generalization outside training domain (error increased from 0.0746 to 8.22), while BEM maintained similar error levels in extended regions.

Conclusion: This direct comparison provides quantitative performance data for both methods, supporting method selection in wave propagation research. PINNs offer fast evaluation but require long training and have limited generalization, while BEM provides consistent performance across domains.

Abstract: Purpose - This study compares the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the two-dimensional
Helmholtz equation in wave scattering problems. The objective is to evaluate
the performance of both methods under the same conditions.
  Design/methodology/approach - We solve the Helmholtz equation using BEM and
PINNs for the same scattering problem. The PINNs are trained by minimizing the
residual of the governing equations and boundary conditions, with their
configuration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while the BEM is
applied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of
solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.
  Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted by varying the number of
integration points for BEM and the number of layers and neurons per layer for
PINNs. Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable
configurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs
produced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42
times longer than BEM. However, once trained, PINNs achieved evaluation times
up to 204 times faster. The generalization capacity was also assessed outside
the PINN training domain, where the relative error increased from $7.46 \times
10^{-2}$ to 8.22, while BEM maintained a similar error level in the extended
region.
  Originality/value - This work presents a direct comparison between PINNs and
BEM for the Helmholtz equation. The analysis provides quantitative data on the
performance of both methods, supporting their selection in future research on
wave propagation problems and establishing future challenges and directions.

TL;DR: NTM is a neural network architecture with fixed graph-aligned components that reduces trainable parameters while maintaining performance in solving stochastic differential games on graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational challenges in solving stochastic differential games on graph-structured multi-agent systems by reducing parameter complexity while preserving interpretability and stability.

Method: Imposes graph-guided sparsification on feedforward networks with non-trainable components aligned with graph topology, integrated into Direct Parameterization and Deep BSDE solvers.

Result: NTM-based methods achieve comparable performance to fully trainable counterparts with improved computational efficiency across various graph structures.

Conclusion: NTM architecture successfully reduces parameter complexity while maintaining solution quality, offering an efficient approach for large-scale graph-based game problems.

Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable
Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential
games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured
multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics,
where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a
graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed,
non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This
design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We
theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static
games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness
through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate
NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep
BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical
experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that
NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable
counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.

TL;DR: Foundation models show competitive zero-shot forecasting of fMRI brain signals and more precise causal interaction detection compared to traditional Granger causality methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how foundation models compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality analysis, and whether they can be applied in zero-shot settings for neuroscience applications.

Method: Tested foundation model's forecasting ability in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, compared Granger-like estimates from the model with standard Granger causality, and validated using synthetic time series from ground-truth causal models (logistic map coupling and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes).

Result: Foundation model achieved competitive zero-shot forecasting (MAPE of 0.55 in controls and 0.27 in patients) and provided more precise detection of causal interactions compared to standard Granger causality.

Conclusion: Foundation models offer versatility, strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal discovery in time-series neuroscience data.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting and causal discovery are central in neuroscience, as
predicting brain activity and identifying causal relationships between neural
populations and circuits can shed light on the mechanisms underlying cognition
and disease. With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they
compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality
analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work,
we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring
directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches
often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of
the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed
causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard
Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series
generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive
zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55
in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not
show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model
provided a more precise detection of causal interactions.
  Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility,
strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal
discovery in time-series data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained widespread adoption but raise serious safety concerns, particularly regarding how their output preferences can be manipulated through carefully crafted images.

Method: Introduces Preference Hijacking (Phi) - a method that uses preference hijacked images to manipulate MLLM response preferences at inference time without requiring model modifications. Also develops universal hijacking perturbations that can be embedded into different images.

Result: Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in hijacking MLLM responses toward attacker-specified preferences.

Conclusion: The paper reveals a new safety risk in MLLMs where output preferences can be arbitrarily manipulated through optimized images, generating contextually relevant but biased responses that are difficult to detect.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant
attention across various domains. However, their widespread adoption has also
raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we uncover a new safety risk of
MLLMs: the output preference of MLLMs can be arbitrarily manipulated by
carefully optimized images. Such attacks often generate contextually relevant
yet biased responses that are neither overtly harmful nor unethical, making
them difficult to detect. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, Preference
Hijacking (Phi), for manipulating the MLLM response preferences using a
preference hijacked image. Our method works at inference time and requires no
model modifications. Additionally, we introduce a universal hijacking
perturbation -- a transferable component that can be embedded into different
images to hijack MLLM responses toward any attacker-specified preferences.
Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. The code for Phi is accessible at https://github.com/Yifan-Lan/Phi.

Abstract: Large language models often produce plausible but incorrect outputs. Existing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs struggle with heterophilic graphs where connected nodes have dissimilar features/labels, often performing worse than simple MLPs. Current methods focus on architectural designs without targeting the root cause of heterophily.

Method: Proposes GRAPHITE framework that explicitly transforms graphs to improve homophily by creating feature nodes that facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes with similar features, based on the exact definition of homophily.

Result: GRAPHITE significantly increases homophily of originally heterophilic graphs with minimal graph size increase. Outperforms 21 latest GNNs on heterophilic datasets while achieving comparable accuracy on homophilic graphs.

Conclusion: GRAPHITE presents an innovative paradigm shift from architectural designs to direct graph transformation for addressing heterophily, demonstrating superior performance on challenging heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic
graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While
numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily
focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the
heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the
simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our
experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor
dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing
graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose
and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph
homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we
present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph
heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that
explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily.
Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates
feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share
similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that
our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally
heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive
experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while
achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic
graphs.

Motivation: Address low sensitivity and high time consumption issues in traditional time series anomaly detection methods.

Method: Construct cross-modal deep metric learning model with triplet selection and loss computation. Use squared Euclidean distances between cluster centers, stochastic gradient descent optimization, and vMF distribution for directional characteristics. Employ principal component direction vectors as anomaly metric.

Result: Method accurately classifies time series data with different attributes, shows high sensitivity to anomalies, achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection speed, and strong robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-modal deep metric learning approach effectively solves time series anomaly detection problems with improved performance metrics.

Abstract: To effectively address the issues of low sensitivity and high time
consumption in time series anomaly detection, we propose an anomaly detection
method based on cross-modal deep metric learning. A cross-modal deep metric
learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a
triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared
Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic
gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify
different time series features. The inner product of principal component
direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von
Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional
characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and
obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction
vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is
performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately
classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high
sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection
speed, and strong robustness.

TL;DR: iCD is a novel knowledge distillation method that transfers interpretable structural knowledge from logits using Gram matrices, achieving significant performance improvements without requiring labels or feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logit Knowledge Distillation lacks interpretability in decision-making despite its simplicity and no requirement for intermediate feature alignment.

Method: Implicit Clustering Distillation (iCD) leverages Gram matrices over decoupled local logit representations to mine and transfer interpretable structural knowledge without ground-truth labels or feature-space alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show iCD is effective across diverse teacher-student architectures, with peak improvement of +5.08% over baseline, particularly strong in fine-grained classification tasks.

Conclusion: iCD provides a simple yet effective approach for transferring interpretable structural knowledge from logits, addressing the interpretability limitations of traditional logit distillation methods.

Abstract: Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in
recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate
feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its
decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering
Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers
interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth
labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled
local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic
structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with
particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks --
achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline. The code is available

*Tim Bary,Beno√Æt Macq,Louis Petit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free, model-agnostic framework for expert deferral using conformal prediction that outperforms standalone models and strongest experts while reducing expert workload by up to 11x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems often fail to deliver reliable predictions across all inputs, and existing Learning to Defer approaches require retraining when experts change, making them impractical for real-world scenarios with changing expert compositions.

Method: Uses conformal prediction to generate prediction sets that identify label-specific uncertainty, then selects the most discriminative expert using a segregativity criterion that measures how well an expert distinguishes between remaining plausible labels.

Result: Achieves accuracies of 99.57¬±0.10% on CIFAR10-H and 99.40¬±0.52% on ImageNet16-H, outperforming both standalone models and strongest experts while reducing expert workload by up to 11x. Method remains robust under degraded expert performance.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, retraining-free alternative to Learning to Defer for real-world human-AI collaboration that works across different models and experts without requiring retraining.

Abstract: AI systems often fail to deliver reliable predictions across all inputs,
prompting the need for hybrid human-AI decision-making. Existing Learning to
Defer (L2D) approaches address this by training deferral models, but these are
sensitive to changes in expert composition and require significant retraining
if experts change. We propose a training-free, model- and expert-agnostic
framework for expert deferral based on conformal prediction. Our method uses
the prediction set generated by a conformal predictor to identify
label-specific uncertainty and selects the most discriminative expert using a
segregativity criterion, measuring how well an expert distinguishes between the
remaining plausible labels. Experiments on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show that
our method consistently outperforms both the standalone model and the strongest
expert, with accuracies attaining $99.57\pm0.10\%$ and $99.40\pm0.52\%$, while
reducing expert workload by up to a factor of $11$. The method remains robust
under degraded expert performance and shows a gradual performance drop in
low-information settings. These results suggest a scalable, retraining-free
alternative to L2D for real-world human-AI collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-based TDA methods require full model access and high computational resources, which limits their practical adoption in real-world scenarios where commercial models are not accessible and resources are limited.

Method: The study investigates TDA under varying access constraints using proxy models, and demonstrates that attribution scores from models without prior training on target datasets remain informative across tasks.

Result: The research shows feasibility of performing TDA under constrained access and that attribution scores from non-target-trained models provide useful information, improving practicality for resource-limited scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical guidance for deploying TDA in real-world environments, enhancing feasibility and efficiency under limited access and computational constraints.

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) plays a critical role in understanding the
influence of individual training data points on model predictions.
Gradient-based TDA methods, popularized by \textit{influence function} for
their superior performance, have been widely applied in data selection, data
cleaning, data economics, and fact tracing. However, in real-world scenarios
where commercial models are not publicly accessible and computational resources
are limited, existing TDA methods are often constrained by their reliance on
full model access and high computational costs. This poses significant
challenges to the broader adoption of TDA in practical applications.
  In this work, we present a systematic study of TDA methods under various
access and resource constraints. We investigate the feasibility of performing
TDA under varying levels of access constraints by leveraging appropriately
designed solutions such as proxy models. Besides, we demonstrate that
attribution scores obtained from models without prior training on the target
dataset remain informative across a range of tasks, which is useful for
scenarios where computational resources are limited. Our findings provide
practical guidance for deploying TDA in real-world environments, aiming to
improve feasibility and efficiency under limited access.

Motivation: Existing AI models struggle to effectively utilize rich multimodal data and extract generalizable representations for understanding the tumor microenvironment and cancer prognosis.

Method: MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts (instead of conventional multi-expert modules) to capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights, using contrastive and supervised learning on data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types.

Conclusion: MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis prediction with strong potential for personalized therapies and improved treatment outcomes.

Abstract: Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic
understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often
struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract
poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data
Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that
effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data
for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional
multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to
comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights.
Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's
generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE
outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal
models, demonstrating substantial improvements in C-index ranging from 3.8% to
11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8% to 8.8% on independent cohorts,
respectively. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable data efficiency across diverse
clinical scenarios. With its enhanced generalizability and data efficiency,
MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis
prediction, holding strong potential to personalize tailored therapies and

*Haozhi Shi,Weiying Xie,Hangyu Ye,Daixun Li,Jitao Ma,Leyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedFD is a frequency-domain federated learning method that reduces communication costs by filtering high-frequency noise and preserving low-frequency components using binary masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FL methods with dataset distillation suffer from redundant information and noise in spatial domains, increasing communication burden while protecting privacy.

Method: Uses discrete cosine transform to identify high-energy concentration regions, applies binary mask to preserve low-frequency components, and incorporates real data-driven synthetic classification loss to enhance quality.

Result: Achieves 37.78% reduction in communication costs and 10.88% performance gain on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet coefficient Œ±=0.01, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on five image and speech datasets.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain filtering effectively reduces communication burden while improving performance in federated learning, demonstrating the value of energy concentration principles in optimizing FL frameworks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents significant potential for collaborative
optimization without data sharing. Since synthetic data is sent to the server,
leveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework
protects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such
methods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire
spatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In
this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with
high-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is
inspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly
distributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy
concentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like
high-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus
filtering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our
FedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components
using a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain
distribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic
classification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the
low-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves
superior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication
costs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $\alpha
= 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\% in the communication
cost, while attaining a 10.88\% performance gain.

*Chan Sik Han,Keon Myung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeRep is a novel anomaly detection method that uses intermediate layer representations from time series foundation models instead of final layer outputs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the UCR Anomaly Archive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on final layer representations of time series foundation models for anomaly detection, but intermediate layers may contain more informative representations that could improve detection accuracy.

Method: TimeRep selects optimal intermediate layer and patch-token positions from pre-trained TSFMs, creates a reference collection of representations using core-set strategy, and computes anomaly scores based on distance to this collection. It includes an adaptation mechanism for concept drift.

Result: TimeRep consistently outperforms a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines including non-DL, DL, and foundation model-based methods on the UCR Anomaly Archive with 250 univariate time series.

Conclusion: Leveraging intermediate layer representations from time series foundation models with proper selection and adaptation mechanisms provides superior anomaly detection performance compared to traditional final-layer approaches.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable
operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models
(TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However,
existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a
task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection
approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations.
Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and
patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep
forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training
data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining
distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score
for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate
representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep
integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the
collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from
incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive,
which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a
broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and
foundation model-based methods.

TL;DR: ILR method randomizes evaluation factors per instance across multiple experiments to reduce variance and improve fairness in LLM comparisons, achieving better robustness with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations suffer from instability due to random factors like few-shot examples, leading to unfair model comparisons and score fluctuations.

Method: Propose instance-level randomization (ILR) that randomizes all evaluation factors for each instance, runs multiple experiments, and reports averaged scores.

Result: ILR reduces variance and unfair comparisons caused by random factors, achieving similar robustness with less than half the computational cost of previous methods.

Conclusion: ILR provides a more stable and fair evaluation framework for LLMs by addressing the volatility issues in current evaluation paradigms.

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where
small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic
fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can
have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a
result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the
paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons
between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically
analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting
these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR)
method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of
using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we
randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance,
run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair
comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness
level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.

*Oliver Knitter,Dan Zhao,Stefan Leichenauer,Shravan Veerapaneni*

TL;DR: Scaling laws for transformer-based neural quantum states in quantum chemistry applications show different relationships between model size and training time compared to language models, with dependencies on loss metric and ansatz type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand scaling laws for neural quantum states (NQS) that use LLM-based components, and to determine optimal performance-resource trade-offs for NQS ansatze in quantum chemistry applications.

Method: Identified scaling laws that predict performance (absolute error and V-score) for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in second-quantized quantum chemistry. Performed compute-constrained optimization of parametric curves.

Result: The relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent on loss metric and ansatz type, and does not follow the approximately linear relationship found for language models.

Conclusion: NQS scaling laws differ significantly from LLM scaling laws, with model size-training time relationships being metric- and ansatz-dependent rather than linear, providing insights for optimal resource allocation in quantum chemistry simulations.

Abstract: Scaling laws have been used to describe how large language model (LLM)
performance scales with model size, training data size, or amount of
computational resources. Motivated by the fact that neural quantum states (NQS)
has increasingly adopted LLM-based components, we seek to understand NQS
scaling laws, thereby shedding light on the scalability and optimal
performance--resource trade-offs of NQS ansatze. In particular, we identify
scaling laws that predict the performance, as measured by absolute error and
V-score, for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in
second-quantized quantum chemistry applications. By performing analogous
compute-constrained optimization of the obtained parametric curves, we find
that the relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent
on loss metric and ansatz, and does not follow the approximately linear
relationship found for language models.

*Eric Cheng,Jie Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZTree is a novel decision tree framework that replaces CART's purity-based splitting with statistical hypothesis testing for subgroup identification, using cross-validation for multiple testing correction and making tree complexity controlled by a single intuitive parameter (z-threshold/p-value).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decision trees like CART use purity-based splitting which lacks statistical grounding. The authors aim to create a more statistically principled alternative that provides better interpretability and performance, especially in low data regimes.

Method: Uses hypothesis testing (z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) at each node to identify meaningful subgroups. Employs cross-validation-based approach for multiple testing correction and stopping criterion. Single z-threshold parameter controls tree complexity.

Result: Empirical evaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets shows ZTree delivers strong performance, especially in low data regimes. It tends to grow simpler trees than CART without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: ZTree provides a statistically grounded, efficient, and flexible alternative to traditional decision trees with intuitive parameter tuning and the ability to derive all simpler trees from a single detailed tree.

Abstract: Decision trees are a commonly used class of machine learning models valued
for their interpretability and versatility, capable of both classification and
regression. We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that
replaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically
principled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis
testing (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a
candidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the
complication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach
to determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping
criterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold
(z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of
the simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned
using the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply
removing nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter
tuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a
p-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into
our framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical
evaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree
consistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes.
Compared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing
performance. ZTree introduces a statistically grounded alternative to
traditional decision tree splitting by leveraging hypothesis testing and a
cross-validation approach to multiple testing correction, resulting in an
efficient and flexible framework.

TL;DR: Soft Graph Transformer (SGT) is a neural architecture for MIMO detection that combines message passing with graph-aware attention to achieve near-ML performance while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing MIMO detectors - ML detection is too complex, conventional message passing relies on impractical assumptions, and prior Transformer-based approaches fail to incorporate MIMO factor graph structure and cannot utilize decoder-side soft information.

Method: Integrates message passing directly into a graph-aware attention mechanism and supports decoder-informed updates through soft-input embeddings, enabling effective soft-output generation.

Result: As a standalone detector, SGT closely approaches ML performance and surpasses prior Transformer-based approaches while preserving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SGT provides an effective solution for MIMO detection that bridges the gap between optimal ML performance and practical computational requirements, with potential for iterative detection-decoding applications.

Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a Soft-Input-Soft-Output neural
architecture tailored for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML)
detection achieves optimal accuracy, its prohibitive exponential complexity
renders it impractical for real-world systems. Conventional message passing
algorithms offer tractable alternatives but rely on large-system asymptotics
and random matrix assumptions, both of which break down under practical
implementations. Prior Transformer-based detectors, on the other hand, fail to
incorporate the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot utilize decoder-side
soft information, limiting their standalone performance and their applicability
in iterative detection-decoding (IDD). To overcome these limitations, SGT
integrates message passing directly into a graph-aware attention mechanism and
supports decoder-informed updates through soft-input embeddings. This design
enables effective soft-output generation while preserving computational
efficiency. As a standalone detector, SGT closely approaches ML performance and
surpasses prior Transformer-based approaches.

TL;DR: A bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning of foundation models that addresses the challenge of limited data scenarios through client-level personalized fine-tuning and server-level personalized aggregation using similar users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of fine-tuning foundation models for small groups of new users or specialized scenarios with limited data, where the trade-off between personalization and federation becomes more sensitive.

Method: Proposes a bi-level personalization framework: 1) Client-level personalized fine-tuning using private data, 2) Server-level personalized aggregation using similar users measured by client-specific task vectors to gain group-wise personalization while mitigating disturbance from irrelevant or interest-conflict clients.

Result: The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been demonstrated by extensive experimental analysis in benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The bi-level personalization framework successfully enables federated fine-tuning of foundation models for specialized scenarios with limited data by balancing personalization and federation through hierarchical optimization.

Abstract: Federated foundation models represent a new paradigm to jointly fine-tune
pre-trained foundation models across clients. It is still a challenge to
fine-tune foundation models for a small group of new users or specialized
scenarios, which typically involve limited data compared to the large-scale
data used in pre-training. In this context, the trade-off between
personalization and federation becomes more sensitive. To tackle these, we
proposed a bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning on
foundation models. Specifically, we conduct personalized fine-tuning on the
client-level using its private data, and then conduct a personalized
aggregation on the server-level using similar users measured by client-specific
task vectors. Given the personalization information gained from client-level
fine-tuning, the server-level personalized aggregation can gain group-wise
personalization information while mitigating the disturbance of irrelevant or
interest-conflict clients with non-IID data. The effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm has been demonstrated by extensive experimental analysis in benchmark
datasets.

Result: NORA improves class separability and overall classification performance, particularly enhancing F1-score for early-stage CKD. It also demonstrates effectiveness across distinct patient cohorts on the UCI CKD dataset.

Conclusion: The NORA framework effectively utilizes non-renal clinical variables for CKD risk stratification, showing promise for early detection in resource-constrained outpatient settings with good cross-cohort generalizability.

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide, yet its
early detection remains challenging, especially in outpatient settings where
laboratory-based renal biomarkers are often unavailable. In this work, we
investigate the predictive potential of routinely collected non-renal clinical
variables for CKD classification, including sociodemographic factors, comorbid
conditions, and urinalysis findings. We introduce the Nephrology-Oriented
Representation leArning (NORA) approach, which combines supervised contrastive

discriminative patient representations from tabular EHR data, which are then
used for downstream CKD classification. We evaluated NORA on a clinic-based EHR
dataset from Riverside Nephrology Physicians. Our results demonstrated that
NORA improves class separability and overall classification performance,
particularly enhancing the F1-score for early-stage CKD. Additionally, we
assessed the generalizability of NORA on the UCI CKD dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness for CKD risk stratification across distinct patient cohorts.

*Jie Yin,Ke Sun,Han Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a new online curvature approximation method for graph continual learning that outperforms existing regularization approaches by better capturing the loss landscape without explicit FIM storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing regularization methods like EWC in graph continual learning, particularly their diagonal FIM approximation and inability to capture the full loss landscape during online learning.

Method: Establishes a general regularization framework based on curved parameter space from Fisher information matrix, then proposes an unbiased online curvature approximation of the full FIM that directly estimates regularization terms without storing the FIM explicitly.

Result: Extensive experiments on three graph datasets show the method significantly outperforms existing regularization-based approaches, achieving superior stability-plasticity trade-off.

Conclusion: The proposed online curvature approximation method effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting in graph continual learning by better capturing the evolving loss landscape during sequential task learning.

Abstract: Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of
graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic
forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free,
class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes.
In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL
based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix
(FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its
variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal
approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To
overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature
approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our
method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without
explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to
better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the
knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability
(retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).

*Francesco Zola,Jon Ander Medina,Andrea Venturi,Amaia Gil,Raul Orduna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes graph machine learning approach with autoencoders to detect financial crime patterns in transactional networks, overcoming sparse data limitations through novel preprocessing and weak labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital ecosystems enable sophisticated financial crimes that traditional rule-based systems cannot detect due to lack of adaptability and inability to analyze complex actor interactions.

Method: Four-step preprocessing framework (graph extraction, temporal management, community detection, automatic labeling) followed by Graph Autoencoder implementation with three variants to detect topological patterns.

Result: Preliminary results show effectiveness in detecting complex financial crime schemes, offering promising alternative to conventional rule-based systems.

Conclusion: Graph machine learning with topology-driven pattern analysis provides effective detection of sophisticated financial crimes in sparse, unlabeled transactional data environments.

Abstract: The rise of digital ecosystems has exposed the financial sector to evolving
abuse and criminal tactics that share operational knowledge and techniques both
within and across different environments (fiat-based, crypto-assets, etc.).
Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect
sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the
need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious
activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we
propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis
to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within
transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of
traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled
information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis.
Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves
(i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage
large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying
automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once
the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among
the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants
are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that
this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex
financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional
rule-based detection systems.

*Rishab Parthasarathy,Achintya Bhowmik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI-based pathway analysis framework using RNNs to predict cancer severity and mutation progression, achieving >60% accuracy without wet lab data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cancer remains a leading cause of death, and current pathway analysis relies on time-consuming wet lab data. Need for efficient AI-based methods to predict cancer progression and recommend treatments.

Method: Combines time-series ML models with pathway analysis. Uses TCGA mutation data, novel preprocessing to filter key mutations, RNN for severity prediction, and integrates drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend treatments.

Result: Achieved robust results with ROC curves >60% accuracy, similar to existing diagnostics. Preprocessing identified few-hundred key driver mutations per cancer stage. Generated heatmaps highlighting key mutations.

Conclusion: First efficient end-to-end framework for cancer progression projection and treatment recommendations without wet lab work, demonstrating cost-effectiveness and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading
cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging
field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet
lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,
effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway
analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus
recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel
combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,
mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.
Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by
mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN
predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple
drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible
treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater
than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing
played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating
that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key
driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted
gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.
Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective
end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible
treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.

### [103] [Similarity-Distance-Magnitude Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12760)
*Allen Schmaltz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust softmax alternative called SDM activation that adds similarity and distance awareness to improve robustness against distribution shifts and provide interpretability for selective classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard softmax lacks robustness to covariate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs, and provides limited interpretability for model decisions.

Method: Developed Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) activation function that incorporates correctly predicted depth-matches (similarity) and distance-to-training-distribution awareness alongside existing magnitude awareness.

Result: SDM activation is more robust than softmax to covariate shifts and OOD inputs in high-probability regions, provides interpretability via dense matching, and enables partitioning of class-wise empirical CDFs for selective classification.

Conclusion: SDM activation is preferable for selective classification tasks, outperforming even post-hoc calibration methods applied to standard softmax, due to its enhanced robustness and interpretability features.

Abstract: We introduce a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard
softmax activation function commonly used with neural networks by adding
Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness
and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output
Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness. When used as the final-layer
activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude
(SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to
co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions,
and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the
prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of
the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among
selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective
classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the
softmax.

Motivation: Machine learning models and libraries suffer from slow and long training times on large datasets, which limits their practical application and scalability.

Method: Mathematical rewriting and optimization of algorithms including Multiple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to enhance computational efficiency.

Result: Achieved approximately 2x speedup for SVM on small datasets and 800x on large datasets, 4x speedup for Logistic Regression, with no accuracy loss in regression models compared to scikit-learn.

Conclusion: EmbeddedML provides a comprehensive set of optimized machine learning algorithms (regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction) that dramatically reduce training time through mathematical enhancements.

Abstract: Machine learning models and libraries can train datasets of different sizes
and perform prediction and classification operations, but machine learning
models and libraries cause slow and long training times on large datasets. This
article introduces EmbeddedML, a training-time-optimized and mathematically
enhanced machine learning library. The speed was increased by approximately
times compared to scikit-learn without any loss in terms of accuracy in
regression models such as Multiple Linear Regression. Logistic Regression and
Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms have been mathematically rewritten to
reduce training time and increase accuracy in classification models. With the
applied mathematical improvements, training time has been reduced by
approximately 2 times for SVM on small datasets and by around 800 times on
large datasets, and by approximately 4 times for Logistic Regression, compared
to the scikit-learn implementation. In summary, the EmbeddedML library offers
regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms
that are mathematically rewritten and optimized to reduce training time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource-constrained IoT devices face challenges with limited energy, unreliable communication, and the impracticality of infinite blocklength transmission in federated learning scenarios.

Method: Develops a framework that combines finite blocklength transmission, model quantization, error-aware aggregation mechanism, and optimizes uplink transmission power to balance energy savings and performance.

Result: Simulation results show up to 75% reduction in energy consumption compared to standard FL models while maintaining robust model accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a viable solution for efficient and reliable federated learning in real-world IoT deployments with constrained resources.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling
collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, making it
particularly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However,
resource-constrained IoT devices face significant challenges due to limited
energy,unreliable communication channels, and the impracticality of assuming
infinite blocklength transmission. This paper proposes a federated learning
framework for IoT networks that integrates finite blocklength transmission,
model quantization, and an error-aware aggregation mechanism to enhance energy
efficiency and communication reliability. The framework also optimizes uplink
transmission power to balance energy savings and model performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy
consumption by up to 75\% compared to a standard FL model, while maintaining
robust model accuracy, making it a viable solution for FL in real-world IoT
scenarios with constrained resources. This work paves the way for efficient and
reliable FL implementations in practical IoT deployments. Index Terms:

### [106] [Safe Reinforcement Learning using Action Projection: Safeguard the Policy or the Environment?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12833)
*Hannah Markgraf,Shamburaj Sawant,Hanna Krasowski,Lukas Sch√§fer,Sebastien Gros,Matthias Althoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical comparison of two projection-based safety filter integration strategies in RL (SE-RL vs SP-RL), focusing on action aliasing effects and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread use in safety-critical RL applications, there's a lack of formal understanding of differences between safe environment RL (SE-RL) and safe policy RL (SP-RL) approaches using projection-based safety filters.

Method: Unified formalization of both approaches in actor-critic context, theoretical analysis of policy gradient estimates, comparative study of mitigation strategies including novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL.

Result: Action aliasing is more detrimental for SP-RL than SE-RL, but with appropriate strategies SP-RL can match or outperform improved SE-RL across environments.

Conclusion: Findings provide actionable insights for choosing and refining projection-based safe RL methods based on task characteristics.

Abstract: Projection-based safety filters, which modify unsafe actions by mapping them
to the closest safe alternative, are widely used to enforce safety constraints
in reinforcement learning (RL). Two integration strategies are commonly
considered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part
of the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the
policy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical
relevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their
differences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of
SE-RL and SP-RL. We identify a key distinction in how each approach is affected
by action aliasing, a phenomenon in which multiple unsafe actions are projected
to the same safe action, causing information loss in the policy gradients. In
SE-RL, this effect is implicitly approximated by the critic, while in SP-RL, it
manifests directly as rank-deficient Jacobians during backpropagation through
the safeguard. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified formalization of
SE-RL and SP-RL in the context of actor-critic algorithms, (ii) a theoretical
analysis of their respective policy gradient estimates, highlighting the role
of action aliasing, and (iii) a comparative study of mitigation strategies,
including a novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL that aligns with
established SE-RL practices. Empirical results support our theoretical
predictions, showing that action aliasing is more detrimental for SP-RL than
for SE-RL. However, with appropriate improvement strategies, SP-RL can match or
outperform improved SE-RL across a range of environments. These findings
provide actionable insights for choosing and refining projection-based safe RL
methods based on task characteristics.

TL;DR: Tool-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to perform multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code, achieving 10% accuracy improvement on GAIA benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have strong language capabilities but struggle with real-world tasks requiring up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or specialized tool use.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework with executable Python code generation, user-defined tool integration, variable sharing across steps, outcome-based rewards, and dynamic sample queue for efficient training.

Result: Substantially improves accuracy and robustness with ~10% gain over baselines on GAIA benchmark, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: Tool-R1 shows potential for enabling reliable and efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling
real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or
specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and
multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports
integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing
across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,
combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy
optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample
queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of
costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1
substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain
over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.
These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and
efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be

### [108] [TimeCluster with PCA is Equivalent to Subspace Identification of Linear Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12895)
*Christian L. Hines,Samuel Spillard,Daniel P. Martin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeCluster visual analytics technique is mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification when using PCA, both extracting the same low-dimensional linear subspace from time series data through sliding-window Hankel matrix and SVD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish the mathematical equivalence between TimeCluster (a visual analytics technique) and classical linear subspace identification methods, revealing that both approaches fundamentally extract the same underlying structure from multivariate time series data.

Method: The paper shows that forming sliding-window matrices from time series creates Hankel matrices, and applying PCA via SVD to these matrices recovers the same principal directions as subspace identification methods, making the cluster coordinates from TimeCluster coincide with subspace identification embeddings.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals confirm that the two embeddings (TimeCluster and subspace identification) coincide, demonstrating their mathematical equivalence in practice.

Conclusion: The equivalence between TimeCluster and subspace identification opens up future opportunities including forecasting from identified state spaces, streaming/online extensions, incorporating external inputs, and robust techniques for visualizing trends in corrupted data.

Abstract: TimeCluster is a visual analytics technique for discovering structure in long
multivariate time series by projecting overlapping windows of data into a
low-dimensional space. We show that, when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is
chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique, this procedure is
mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification
(block-Hankel matrix plus Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD)). In both
approaches, the same low-dimensional linear subspace is extracted from the time
series data. We first review the TimeCluster method and the theory of subspace
system identification. Then we show that forming the sliding-window matrix of a
time series yields a Hankel matrix, so applying PCA (via SVD) to this matrix
recovers the same principal directions as subspace identification. Thus the
cluster coordinates from TimeCluster coincide with the subspace identification
methods. We present experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals
confirming that the two embeddings coincide. Finally, we explore and discuss
future opportunities enabled by this equivalence, including forecasting from
the identified state space, streaming/online extensions, incorporating and
visualising external inputs and robust techniques for displaying underlying
trends in corrupted data.

*Sam McCallum,Kamran Arora,James Foster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RevDEQs introduce reversible deep equilibrium models that enable exact gradient calculation, eliminating the need for regularization and reducing function evaluations compared to standard DEQs, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) outperform explicit models but suffer from approximate gradient calculations leading to unstable training, requiring regularization and many function evaluations.

Method: Introducing Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient calculation without regularization and with fewer function evaluations.

Result: RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modeling and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.

Conclusion: RevDEQs provide a more stable and efficient alternative to standard DEQs by enabling exact gradient computation and reducing computational overhead while maintaining superior performance.

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are an interesting class of implicit model
where the model output is implicitly defined as the fixed point of a learned
function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth)
models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that
is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is
approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires
regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce
Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient
calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We
show that RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modelling
and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.

*Huseyin Karaca,Suleyman Serdar Kozat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Soft gradient boosting with learnable linear feature transforms that optimizes feature selection and boosting simultaneously, particularly effective in high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of high-dimensional, data-scarce regression problems by discovering relevant input representations during the boosting process, avoiding overfitting while improving performance.

Method: At each boosting iteration, train a soft decision tree and learn a linear input feature transform Q together, enabling end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and boosting. Also extendable to differentiable non-linear transforms.

Result: The method effectively and efficiently increases performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating improved performance while avoiding overfitting.

Conclusion: The proposed soft gradient boosting framework successfully integrates feature transformation learning with boosting, providing an effective solution for high-dimensional regression problems with limited data availability.

Abstract: We propose a soft gradient boosting framework for sequential regression that
embeds a learnable linear feature transform within the boosting procedure. At
each boosting iteration, we train a soft decision tree and learn a linear input
feature transform Q together. This approach is particularly advantageous in
high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios, as it discovers the most relevant
input representations while boosting. We demonstrate, using both synthetic and
real-world datasets, that our method effectively and efficiently increases the
performance by an end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and
boosting while avoiding overfitting. We also extend our algorithm to
differentiable non-linear transforms if overfitting is not a problem. To
support reproducibility and future work, we share our code publicly.

### [111] [Sy-FAR: Symmetry-based Fair Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12939)
*Haneen Najjar,Eyal Ronen,Mahmood Sharif*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sy-FAR introduces symmetry-focused adversarial robustness to address fairness issues in security-critical ML systems, proving more tractable than perfect fairness while improving robustness and reducing target class vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security-critical ML systems like face recognition are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exhibit unfair robustness - some classes/groups are easier to attack than others. Prior fairness approaches focused on perfect parity which is infeasible in realistic scenarios where classes may be highly similar.

Method: Developed Sy-FAR technique that encourages symmetry (attacks from class i to j should be as successful as from j to i) while optimizing adversarial robustness. The approach is theoretically proven to induce symmetry between any subgroups.

Result: Extensive evaluation on 5 datasets with 3 model architectures shows Sy-FAR significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. It's faster, more consistent across runs, and reduces vulnerability of target classes that adversarial examples tend to be classified into.

Conclusion: Symmetry is a more tractable and desirable fairness notion than perfect parity for adversarial robustness in security-critical systems, as class resemblance is inherently symmetric and symmetry induces fairness across all subgroups.

Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition
systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world
physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial
robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair
robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than
from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial
robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has
focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight
is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as
face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,
leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that
seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful
as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable
because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.
Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces
symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions
where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to
encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively
evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including
against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR
significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across
runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover
in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be
classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the development of more balanced and reliable LLMs by understanding method-specific performance characteristics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing

TL;DR: A simple post-training approach enhances ECG foundation model performance, improving AUROC by 1.2%-3.3% and AUPRC by 5.3%-20.9% on PTB-XL benchmark, with better stability and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG foundation models show performance gaps compared to task-specific models despite large-scale pre-training, indicating a need for effective post-training strategies to improve clinical applicability.

Method: Proposes a post-training approach for ECGFounder (pre-trained on 7M+ ECG recordings) that includes key components like stochastic depth and preview linear probing to enhance model performance after fine-tuning.

Result: Significant improvements over baseline: 1.2%-3.3% in macro AUROC, 5.3%-20.9% in macro AUPRC. Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches including task-specific architectures. Achieves 9.1% AUROC and 34.9% AUPRC improvement using only 10% training data.

Conclusion: Post-training strategies effectively enhance ECG foundation models, demonstrating improved performance, stability, and sample efficiency, contributing to better clinical applicability of ECG AI systems.

Abstract: ECG foundation models are increasingly popular due to their adaptability
across various tasks. However, their clinical applicability is often limited by
performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on
large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely
due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECGFounder, a
state-of-the-art ECG foundation model pre-trained on over 7 million ECG
recordings. Experiments on the PTB-XL benchmark show that our approach improves
the baseline fine-tuning strategy by 1.2%-3.3% in macro AUROC and 5.3%-20.9% in
macro AUPRC. Additionally, our method outperforms several recent
state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced
architectures. Further evaluation reveals that our method is more stable and
sample-efficient compared to the baseline, achieving a 9.1% improvement in
macro AUROC and a 34.9% improvement in macro AUPRC using just 10% of the
training data. Ablation studies identify key components, such as stochastic
depth and preview linear probing, that contribute to the enhanced performance.
These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve
ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued
development of foundation models in the ECG domain.

TL;DR: FinSearchComp is the first open-source benchmark for evaluating LLM agents' financial search and reasoning capabilities, featuring 635 expert-annotated questions across three realistic financial analyst tasks spanning global and Greater China markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial datasets don't evaluate end-to-end agent search capabilities due to the complexity of constructing realistic, time-sensitive financial tasks requiring deep domain expertise.

Method: Created three task types (Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, Complex Historical Investigation) mirroring real analyst workflows, with 70 financial experts annotating 635 questions and implementing multi-stage quality assurance.

Result: Grok 4 (web) achieved expert-level accuracy on global markets, DouBao (web) led on Greater China subset. Web search and financial plugins significantly improved performance, with model/tool country origin impacting results.

Conclusion: FinSearchComp provides a professional, high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning that aligns with realistic analyst tasks and enables end-to-end evaluation of LLM agents.

Abstract: Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely
viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a
particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex,
multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal
for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no
existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of
end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks
requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate.
We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for
realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises
three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and
Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial
analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70
professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous
multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions
spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products)
on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy.
DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that
equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves
results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact
performance significantly.By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and
providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional,
high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified model that captures uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure for analyzing cardiac motion from sparse observations, addressing the need for accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and disease classification in biomedical spatiotemporal data.

Result: Validated on three synthetic systems and two real-world cardiac datasets (ACDC N=150, UK Biobank N=526). Achieves accurate trajectory reconstruction and extrapolation of future cardiac cycles from single observed cycle. State-of-the-art ACDC classification (99% accuracy) and competitive atrial fibrillation detection in UK Biobank (67% accuracy).

Conclusion: The framework provides a flexible approach for cardiac motion analysis and establishes a foundation for graph-based learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data, demonstrating strong performance in both reconstruction and disease classification tasks.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal
dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach
integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural
networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures
uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent
dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent
trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context
observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over
latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and
extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic
dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto
oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK
Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and
disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs
trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed
cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up
to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with
competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible
approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based
learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of individual fairness in generative classifiers through robustness to private feature perturbations, showing correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate individual fairness in probabilistic classifiers by examining how robust posterior inferences are to perturbations in private features, addressing the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

Method: Used Bayesian networks as generative models on 14 benchmark datasets with fairness concerns. Reformulated robustness analysis as a most probable explanation task in an auxiliary Markov random field to handle computational complexity.

Result: Empirical experiments confirmed the hypothesis that instances with greater robustness to private feature perturbations are more likely to be classified accurately.

Conclusion: The correlation between robustness and accuracy suggests new approaches to mitigate the traditional trade-off between fairness and predictive performance in machine learning systems.

Abstract: We investigate individual fairness in generative probabilistic classifiers by
analysing the robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private
features. Building on established results in robustness analysis, we
hypothesise a correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy,
specifically, instances exhibiting greater robustness are more likely to be
classified accurately. We empirically assess this hypothesis using a benchmark
of fourteen datasets with fairness concerns, employing Bayesian networks as the
underlying generative models. To address the computational complexity
associated with robustness analysis over multiple private features with
Bayesian networks, we reformulate the problem as a most probable explanation
task in an auxiliary Markov random field. Our experiments confirm the
hypothesis about the correlation, suggesting novel directions to mitigate the
traditional trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

*Honghong Zeng,Jiong Lou,Zhe Wang,Hefeng Zhou,Chentao Wu,Wei Zhao,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PFL shows inherent resistance to backdoor attacks due to prototype learning and data heterogeneity. BAPFL is the first backdoor attack method specifically for PFL, achieving 35-75% higher attack success rates than traditional methods while maintaining main task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prototype-based federated learning (PFL) has shown promise for handling data heterogeneity, but its security against backdoor attacks remains unexplored. The paper aims to investigate PFL's robustness and develop targeted attacks.

Method: Proposed BAPFL method with two components: 1) prototype poisoning strategy to manipulate global prototypes and mislead benign clients, 2) trigger optimization mechanism to learn unique stealthy triggers for each target label and align trigger-embedded samples with target prototypes.

Result: BAPFL achieves 35-75% improvement in attack success rate compared to traditional backdoor attacks across multiple datasets and PFL variants, while preserving main task accuracy.

Conclusion: BAPFL demonstrates effectiveness, stealthiness, and adaptability in attacking PFL frameworks, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms in prototype-based federated learning systems.

Abstract: Prototype-based federated learning (PFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
to address data heterogeneity problems in federated learning, as it leverages
mean feature vectors as prototypes to enhance model generalization. However,
its robustness against backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we identify that PFL is inherently resistant to existing backdoor
attacks due to its unique prototype learning mechanism and local data
heterogeneity. To further explore the security of PFL, we propose BAPFL, the
first backdoor attack method specifically designed for PFL frameworks. BAPFL
integrates a prototype poisoning strategy with a trigger optimization
mechanism. The prototype poisoning strategy manipulates the trajectories of
global prototypes to mislead the prototype training of benign clients, pushing
their local prototypes of clean samples away from the prototypes of
trigger-embedded samples. Meanwhile, the trigger optimization mechanism learns
a unique and stealthy trigger for each potential target label, and guides the
prototypes of trigger-embedded samples to align closely with the global
prototype of the target label. Experimental results across multiple datasets
and PFL variants demonstrate that BAPFL achieves a 35\%-75\% improvement in
attack success rate compared to traditional backdoor attacks, while preserving
main task accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness,
and adaptability of BAPFL in PFL.

*Yunchuan Guan,Yu Liu,Ke Zhou,Zhiqi Shen,Jenq-Neng Hwang,Serge Belongie,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-learning shows tighter generalization bounds than whole-class training in entropy-limited settings, proving more efficient and robust. MINO framework enhances unsupervised performance through adaptive clustering and noise-resistant meta-scaler.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the value of meta-learning over whole-class training strategies in few-shot tasks, particularly in fair comparison settings with limited entropy.

Method: Established entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons, conducted theoretical analysis and experimental validation. Proposed MINO framework using DBSCAN clustering with dynamic head for task construction and stability-based meta-scaler for noise robustness.

Result: Meta-learning has tighter generalization bound, is more efficient with limited entropy, and more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks. MINO shows effectiveness in multiple unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: Meta-learning provides superior performance in challenging settings with limited data and noise, making it particularly valuable for unsupervised tasks through frameworks like MINO.

Abstract: Meta-learning is a powerful paradigm for tackling few-shot tasks. However,
recent studies indicate that models trained with the whole-class training
strategy can achieve comparable performance to those trained with meta-learning
in few-shot classification tasks. To demonstrate the value of meta-learning, we
establish an entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons. Through
both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we establish that
meta-learning has a tighter generalization bound compared to whole-class
training. We unravel that meta-learning is more efficient with limited entropy
and is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks, making it
well-suited for unsupervised tasks. Based on these insights, We propose MINO, a
meta-learning framework designed to enhance unsupervised performance. MINO
utilizes the adaptive clustering algorithm DBSCAN with a dynamic head for
unsupervised task construction and a stability-based meta-scaler for robustness
against label noise. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness in
multiple unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

### [119] [Causal Discovery via Quantile Partial Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12981)
*Yikang Chen,Xingzhe Sun,Dehui Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantile Partial Effect (QPE) enables causal discovery by analyzing shape asymmetry in observational data without requiring noise or Markov assumptions, working for both bivariate and multivariate cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a causal discovery method that doesn't rely on traditional assumptions like additive noise or Markov conditions, but instead uses shape characteristics in observational distributions to identify causal directions.

Method: Uses Quantile Partial Effect (QPE) statistics from conditional quantile regression. For bivariate cases, performs basis function tests on estimated QPE. For multivariate cases, leverages connection between QPE and score functions, using Fisher Information to determine causal order under second moment assumptions.

Result: The method effectively distinguishes causal directions in bivariate datasets and successfully identifies causal order in multiple synthetic and real-world multivariate datasets using Fisher Information.

Conclusion: QPE provides a powerful framework for causal discovery that operates purely at the observational level, generalizing previous methods and demonstrating effectiveness across various datasets without requiring traditional causal modeling assumptions.

Abstract: Quantile Partial Effect (QPE) is a statistic associated with conditional
quantile regression, measuring the effect of covariates at different levels.
Our theory demonstrates that when the QPE of cause on effect is assumed to lie
in a finite linear span, cause and effect are identifiable from their
observational distribution. This generalizes previous identifiability results
based on Functional Causal Models (FCMs) with additive, heteroscedastic noise,
etc. Meanwhile, since QPE resides entirely at the observational level, this
parametric assumption does not require considering mechanisms, noise, or even
the Markov assumption, but rather directly utilizes the asymmetry of shape
characteristics in the observational distribution. By performing basis function
tests on the estimated QPE, causal directions can be distinguished, which is
empirically shown to be effective in experiments on a large number of bivariate
causal discovery datasets. For multivariate causal discovery, leveraging the
close connection between QPE and score functions, we find that Fisher
Information is sufficient as a statistical measure to determine causal order
when assumptions are made about the second moment of QPE. We validate the
feasibility of using Fisher Information to identify causal order on multiple
synthetic and real-world multivariate causal discovery datasets.

TL;DR: A hybrid U-Net autoencoder with Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) for superior clustering of high-dimensional spatiotemporal climate data, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional clustering methods struggle with complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial interactions, and non-stationary dynamics in high-dimensional spatiotemporal climate data.

Method: Time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder with ConvLSTM2D modules for spatiotemporal feature extraction, skip connections for multiscale detail preservation, and B-TGAT at bottleneck for graph-based spatial modeling and attention-driven temporal encoding.

Result: Superior cluster separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions on three distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while providing interpretable insights into complex spatiotemporal variability.

Abstract: Clustering high-dimensional multivariate spatiotemporal climate data is
challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial
interactions, and non-stationary dynamics. Conventional clustering methods,
including recurrent and convolutional models, often struggle to capture both
local and global temporal relationships while preserving spatial context. We
present a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a
Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient
temporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The
encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint
spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial
correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial
details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck,
B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal
encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both
short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces
discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three
distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster
separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net
skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while
providing interpretable insights into complex spatiotemporal variability,
advancing both methodological development and climate science applications.

### [121] [Single-stream Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13232)
*Zhongwen Xu,Zihan Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPO introduces single-stream policy optimization for LLMs, replacing group-based methods with persistent value tracking and global advantage normalization for more stable and efficient learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group-based methods like GRPO suffer from degenerate groups erasing learning signals and synchronization barriers hindering scalability in LLM policy optimization.

Method: SPO uses a persistent KL-adaptive value tracker instead of per-group baselines and normalizes advantages globally across batches, eliminating the need for groups and enabling higher throughput.

Result: SPO achieves +3.4pp average improvement on math benchmarks over GRPO, with significant gains on challenging datasets (+7.3pp on BRUMO 25, +4.4pp on AIME 25, +3.3pp on HMMT 25).

Conclusion: SPO provides a more robust and efficient path for LLM reasoning by focusing on fundamental principles rather than architectural workarounds, challenging the trend of adding complexity to RL algorithms.

Abstract: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from
a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce
variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent
degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder
scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which
eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a
persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across
the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.
Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in
long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.
Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive
curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO
converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while
eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm
that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and
advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM
reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the
average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial
absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25,
+4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain
in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the
prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting
a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the
next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective way to visualize and analyze data ensembles by creating structured probabilistic representations in lower-dimensional latent spaces.

Method: Transform spatial ensemble features into latent space using feature space conversion and unsupervised learning with variational autoencoder (VAE), resulting in multivariate standard Gaussian distributions.

Result: Preliminary results on weather forecasting ensemble demonstrate the method's effectiveness and versatility for analytical computation of confidence intervals and density estimation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully creates structured probabilistic latent representations that enable analytical visualization and computation for data ensembles.

Abstract: We present a new method to visualize data ensembles by constructing
structured probabilistic representations in latent spaces, i.e.,
lower-dimensional representations of spatial data features. Our approach
transforms the spatial features of an ensemble into a latent space through
feature space conversion and unsupervised learning using a variational
autoencoder (VAE). The resulting latent spaces follow multivariate standard
Gaussian distributions, enabling analytical computation of confidence intervals
and density estimation of the probabilistic distribution that generates the
data ensemble. Preliminary results on a weather forecasting ensemble
demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.

*Aniket Didolkar,Nicolas Ballas,Sanjeev Arora,Anirudh Goyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs convert recurring reasoning steps into reusable "behaviors" stored in a handbook, reducing token usage by up to 46% while maintaining or improving accuracy across three different reasoning settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often re-derive the same intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency while saturating context windows and leaving less capacity for exploration.

Method: Convert recurring reasoning fragments into concise reusable behaviors via metacognitive analysis, store them in a behavior handbook, and use them in-context during inference or distill via supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Achieved 46% reduction in reasoning tokens while matching/improving accuracy, 10% higher accuracy than baseline in self-improvement, and more effective conversion of non-reasoning models via behavior-conditioned SFT.

Conclusion: Turning slow derivations into fast procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to conclude, improving efficiency and effectiveness across multiple reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting
extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same
intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This
saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study
a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,
reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive
analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook"
which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into
parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved
test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned
inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning
reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving
baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter
updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors
from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher
accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned
SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at
converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla
SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast
procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to
conclude.

TL;DR: ReTrack is a fast data unlearning method for diffusion models that uses importance sampling to efficiently remove specific training data influence while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from training data memorization, creating privacy and safety concerns that require effective data removal without full retraining.

Method: Uses importance sampling to construct an efficient fine-tuning loss, approximating by retaining only dominant terms to redirect denoising trajectories toward k-nearest neighbors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion, providing the best trade-off between unlearning strength and generation quality.

Conclusion: ReTrack offers an effective and efficient solution for data unlearning in diffusion models, addressing privacy concerns while preserving model performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images but suffer
from training data memorization, raising critical privacy and safety concerns.
Data unlearning has emerged to mitigate this issue by removing the influence of
specific data without retraining from scratch. We propose ReTrack, a fast and
effective data unlearning method for diffusion models. ReTrack employs
importance sampling to construct a more efficient fine-tuning loss, which we
approximate by retaining only dominant terms. This yields an interpretable
objective that redirects denoising trajectories toward the $k$-nearest
neighbors, enabling efficient unlearning while preserving generative quality.
Experiments on MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion show
that ReTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, striking the best trade-off

*Jiahao Zhang,Xiaobing Pei,Zhaokun Zhong,Wenqiang Hao,Zhenghao Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JANUS is a dual-constraint framework for stealthy node injection attacks on GNNs that addresses local myopia by aligning both local feature manifolds and global semantic patterns through reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing node injection attacks lack proper stealthiness measures, relying on indirect proxy metrics or focusing only on local structure imitation, leading to local myopia and detection vulnerability.

Method: Proposes JANUS framework with local feature manifold alignment for geometric consistency and global mutual information maximization using structured latent variables. Models injection as sequential decision process optimized by reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments on multiple standard datasets show JANUS significantly outperforms existing methods in both attack effectiveness and stealthiness.

Conclusion: The dual-constraint approach addressing both local and global structural consistency enables more effective and stealthy node injection attacks on GNNs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial
attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks
heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original
graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness
by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental
characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local
structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,
called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local
level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve
geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate
structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the
generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the
semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a
sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning
agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS
framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack
effectiveness and stealthiness.

TL;DR: Spiking Vocos is an ultra-low energy neural vocoder using spiking neural networks that achieves comparable performance to ANN counterparts while consuming only 14.7% of the energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High energy consumption of neural vocoders prevents practical deployment on edge devices, while SNNs offer energy-efficient event-driven computation for low-resource scenarios.

Method: Built on Vocos framework with Spiking ConvNeXt module to reduce MAC operations, amplitude shortcut path to preserve signal dynamics, self-architectural distillation for knowledge transfer, and Temporal Shift Module for temporal information fusion.

Result: Achieves UTMOS score of 3.74 and PESQ score of 3.45, comparable to ANN counterpart, while consuming only 14.7% of the energy.

Conclusion: Spiking Vocos demonstrates that SNN-based vocoders can achieve high performance with ultra-low energy consumption, making them suitable for edge device deployment.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in the synthesis speed and fidelity of neural
vocoders, their high energy consumption remains a critical barrier to practical
deployment on computationally restricted edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), widely recognized for their high energy efficiency due to their
event-driven nature, offer a promising solution for low-resource scenarios. In
this paper, we propose Spiking Vocos, a novel spiking neural vocoder with
ultra-low energy consumption, built upon the efficient Vocos framework. To
mitigate the inherent information bottleneck in SNNs, we design a Spiking
ConvNeXt module to reduce Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and incorporate
an amplitude shortcut path to preserve crucial signal dynamics. Furthermore, to
bridge the performance gap with its Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
counterpart, we introduce a self-architectural distillation strategy to
effectively transfer knowledge. A lightweight Temporal Shift Module is also
integrated to enhance the model's ability to fuse information across the
temporal dimension with negligible computational overhead. Experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to its ANN
counterpart, with UTMOS and PESQ scores of 3.74 and 3.45 respectively, while
consuming only 14.7% of the energy. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Traces Propagation (TP), a fully local and memory-efficient learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks that combines eligibility traces with layer-wise contrastive loss, eliminating need for auxiliary matrices while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SNN training methods like BPTT are biologically implausible and computationally expensive, while existing local learning rules require auxiliary matrices that increase memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices.

Method: Traces Propagation (TP) combines eligibility traces with layer-wise contrastive loss in a forward-only approach without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices, making it fully local and memory-efficient.

Result: TP outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets, shows competitive performance on DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, scales effectively to deeper architectures like VGG-9, and works well for practical fine-tuning tasks like keyword spotting.

Conclusion: TP provides an efficient, scalable, and fully local learning rule for SNNs that enables effective on-device learning with favorable memory scaling, making it suitable for edge computing applications.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient framework for processing
dynamic spatio-temporal signals and for investigating the learning principles
underlying biological neural systems. A key challenge in training SNNs is to
solve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for
training SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients.
However, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality
observed in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and
memory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning.
Although existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment
by leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit
assignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase
memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this
work, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient,
scalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a
layer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP
outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On
more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases
competitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such
as VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully
local scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes.
Finally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such
as keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way
for efficient learning at the edge.

*Mengyi Deng,Xin Li,Tingyu Zhu,Zhicheng Yang,Zhijiang Guo,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bidirectional reasoning with forward and reverse data improves accuracy but creates conflicting supervision signals that weaken directional distinction, requiring better alignment strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on unidirectional SFT and overlook the interplay between diverse reasoning patterns, limiting performance despite data distillation.

Method: Constructed r1k reverse reasoning dataset from s1k, then examined SFT and DPO effects under bidirectional reasoning objectives with mixed forward/reverse data.

Result: SFT on r1k alone improved accuracy by 1.6%-6.8% over s1k, but mixing data weakened directional distinction. DPO partially recovered distinction but suppressed less preferred reasoning paths.

Conclusion: Mixed reasoning data introduces conflicting supervision signals, highlighting the need for robust, direction-aware alignment strategies rather than naive data mixing.

Abstract: Existing work has shown that o1-level performance can be achieved with
limited data distillation, but most existing methods focus on unidirectional
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), overlooking the intricate interplay between
diverse reasoning patterns. In this paper, we construct r1k, a high-quality
reverse reasoning dataset derived by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k,
and examine how SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) affect alignment
under bidirectional reasoning objectives. SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8%
accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively
mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction.
Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less
preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant
outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting
supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware
alignment strategies.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art autoregressive methods on standard benchmarks. Generates more interpretable and diverse mathematical expressions compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: DiffuSR provides an effective diffusion-based framework for symbolic regression that successfully bridges continuous diffusion models with discrete symbolic equation generation, offering improved interpretability and diversity in discovered equations.

Abstract: Discovering valid and meaningful mathematical equations from observed data
plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. While this task, symbolic
regression, remains challenging due to the vast search space and the trade-off
between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSR, a
pre-training framework for symbolic regression built upon a continuous-state
diffusion language model. DiffuSR employs a trainable embedding layer within
the diffusion process to map discrete mathematical symbols into a continuous
latent space, modeling equation distributions effectively. Through iterative
denoising, DiffuSR converts an initial noisy sequence into a symbolic equation,
guided by numerical data injected via a cross-attention mechanism. We also
design an effective inference strategy to enhance the accuracy of the
diffusion-based equation generator, which injects logit priors into genetic
programming. Experimental results on standard symbolic regression benchmarks
demonstrate that DiffuSR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
autoregressive methods and generates more interpretable and diverse
mathematical expressions.

*Paul Garnier,Vincent Lannelongue,Elie Hachem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Coarse-to-fine curriculum learning accelerates GNN training for CFD by starting with coarse meshes and progressively increasing resolution, reducing training time by 50% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training GNNs on high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes is prohibitively expensive for computational fluid dynamics applications.

Method: A coarse-to-fine curriculum approach where the model remains unchanged but training starts on very coarse meshes, then progressively introduces medium and high resolutions up to 300,000 nodes.

Result: Achieved comparable generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock training time by up to 50%, and enabled models to break through plateaus when lacking capacity to learn underlying physics.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning with progressive mesh resolution provides an effective way to accelerate GNN training for CFD applications without modifying the model architecture.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for
mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on
high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains
prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that
accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then
progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\)
nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged;
only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable
generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%.
Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the
underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through
plateaus.

*Kushal Bose,Swagatam Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of how self-loops and parallel edges affect graph spectra and GCN performance on heterophilic graphs, showing connections between graph properties and filter behavior without costly eigenvalue decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph heterophily challenges MP-GNN performance, particularly low-pass filters like GCNs, which suffer from blending messages from dissimilar nodes. The relationship between graph spectra and performance trends on heterophilic graphs needs deeper investigation.

Method: Updated heterophilic graphs by adding self-loops and parallel edges, analyzed how eigenvalues of graph Laplacian change, conducted studies on GCN performance across benchmark heterophilic networks with these modifications.

Result: GCN performance shows increasing or decreasing trends when adding self-loops vs parallel edges. Established connections between graph spectra and low-pass filter performance, enabling graph property evaluation without expensive eigenvalue decomposition.

Conclusion: Graph spectra characterize intrinsic graph properties and correlate with GCN performance on heterophilic graphs. Self-loops and parallel edges provide a practical way to assess graph properties through performance trends rather than costly spectral analysis.

Abstract: Graph heterophily poses a formidable challenge to the performance of
Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). The familiar low-pass filters
like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation, which
can be attributed to the blending of the messages from dissimilar neighboring
nodes. The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still
requires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic
graphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that
eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by
increasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several
studies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic
networks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that
the GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding
self-loops and parallel edges. In light of the studies, we established
connections between the graph spectra and the performance trends of the
low-pass filters on the heterophilic graphs. The graph spectra characterize the
essential intrinsic properties of the input graph like the presence of
connected components, sparsity, average degree, cluster structures, etc. Our
work is adept at seamlessly evaluating graph spectrum and properties by
observing the performance trends of the low-pass filters without pursuing the
costly eigenvalue decomposition. The theoretical foundations are also discussed
to validate the impact of adding self-loops and parallel edges on the graph
spectrum.

*Claudio Battiloro,Andrea Cavallo,Elvin Isufi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoVariance Neural Networks extended to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces using covariance operators, with theoretical guarantees and practical validation on time-series classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend the robustness and transferability properties of VNNs from finite to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, addressing the gap in understanding for functional data analysis.

Method: Introduce Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and Networks (HVNs) based on covariance operators, with principled discretization and theoretical analysis showing recovery of Functional PCA.

Result: HVNs demonstrate robust performance on synthetic and real-world time-series classification tasks, outperforming MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully extends covariance-based neural networks to infinite-dimensional spaces with theoretical foundations and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical
covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known
about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In
this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning
framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define
Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs)
as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a
principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can
recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the
versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate
real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we
validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification
tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.

*Minghui Lu,Yanyong Huang,Minbo Ma,Dongjie Wang,Xiuwen Yi,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRUST-FS is a novel tensor-based method for multi-view unsupervised feature selection that simultaneously handles missing variables, performs feature selection, and learns view weights through unified tensor factorization with reliable similarity graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MUFS methods have limitations: they can't handle missing variables (only missing views), treat imputation and feature selection separately, and suffer from inaccurate similarity graphs due to missing data.

Method: Proposes TRUST-FS with adaptive-weighted CP decomposition that unifies feature selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning. Uses Subjective Logic to obtain trustworthy cross-view similarity information for reliable graph learning.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show TRUST-FS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: TRUST-FS provides a unified framework that successfully addresses the challenges of incomplete multi-view data with missing variables through simultaneous tensor factorization and reliable similarity learning.

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS), which selects informative
features from multi-view unlabeled data, has attracted increasing research
interest in recent years. Although great efforts have been devoted to MUFS,
several challenges remain: 1) existing methods for incomplete multi-view data
are limited to handling missing views and are unable to address the more
general scenario of missing variables, where some features have missing values
in certain views; 2) most methods address incomplete data by first imputing
missing values and then performing feature selection, treating these two
processes independently and overlooking their interactions; 3) missing data can
result in an inaccurate similarity graph, which reduces the performance of
feature selection. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel MUFS method for
incomplete multi-view data with missing variables, termed Tensorized Reliable
UnSupervised mulTi-view Feature Selection (TRUST-FS). TRUST-FS introduces a new
adaptive-weighted CP decomposition that simultaneously performs feature
selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning within a
unified tensor factorization framework. By utilizing Subjective Logic to
acquire trustworthy cross-view similarity information, TRUST-FS facilitates
learning a reliable similarity graph, which subsequently guides feature
selection and imputation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

### [134] [HAM: Hierarchical Adapter Merging for Scalable Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13211)
*Eric Nuertey Coleman,Luigi Quarantiello,Samrat Mukherjee,Julio Hurtado,Vincenzo Lomonaco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HAM is a novel continual learning framework that dynamically merges adapters from different tasks using hierarchical grouping, enabling efficient scaling to more tasks with reduced interference compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods like LoRA struggle with scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long task sequences, as maintaining separate adapters per task increases complexity and potential interference between tasks.

Method: HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, it trains a low-rank adapter with importance scalar, groups tasks by adapter similarity, then prunes, scales and merges adapters within groups to facilitate transfer learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on three vision benchmarks show HAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.

Conclusion: HAM provides an effective solution for scalable continual learning by dynamically combining adapters through hierarchical grouping, addressing catastrophic forgetting and enabling efficient knowledge transfer across related tasks.

Abstract: Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it
poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary
issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information,
causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon
known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can
partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and
over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data
distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA,
enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face
challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of
tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases
the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical
Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters
from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale
effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with
improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that
hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank
adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on
adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge,
facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on
three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.

*Paolo Climaco,Jochen Garcke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DA-FPS sampling method reduces prediction error in regression with limited labeled data by minimizing weighted fill distance bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labeled training data due to computational constraints or high labeling costs requires efficient data selection methods for regression models.

Method: Proposed Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling (DA-FPS), a passive model-agnostic method that minimizes weighted fill distance bound derived for Lipschitz continuous regression models.

Result: DA-FPS significantly reduces mean absolute prediction error compared to other sampling strategies across two regression models and three datasets.

Conclusion: DA-FPS effectively balances performance and efficiency by selecting optimal training sets through data-driven minimization of prediction error bounds.

Abstract: We focus on training machine learning regression models in scenarios where
the availability of labeled training data is limited due to computational
constraints or high labeling costs. Thus, selecting suitable training sets from
unlabeled data is essential for balancing performance and efficiency. For the
selection of the training data, we focus on passive and model-agnostic sampling
methods that only consider the data feature representations. We derive an upper
bound for the expected prediction error of Lipschitz continuous regression
models that linearly depends on the weighted fill distance of the training set,
a quantity we can estimate simply by considering the data features. We
introduce "Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling" (DA-FPS), a novel sampling
method. We prove that DA-FPS provides approximate minimizers for a data-driven
estimation of the weighted fill distance, thereby aiming at minimizing our
derived bound. We conduct experiments using two regression models across three
datasets. The results demonstrate that DA-FPS significantly reduces the mean
absolute prediction error compared to other sampling strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOSSIL is a unified weighting framework that addresses imbalanced and small data problems by integrating class imbalance correction, difficulty-aware curricula, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics into a single interpretable formula with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced and small data regimes are common in domains like rare disease imaging and genomics, where labeled samples are scarce and existing solutions like oversampling or focal loss are fragile or complex.

Method: FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization via Sample Sensitive Importance Learning) - a unified weighting framework that combines multiple techniques into a single interpretable formula with regret-based theoretical guarantees.

Result: Achieves consistent empirical gains over ERM, curriculum, and meta-weighting baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets without requiring architectural changes.

Conclusion: FOSSIL provides a robust and theoretically-grounded solution for imbalanced and small data problems, outperforming existing approaches while maintaining simplicity and interpretability.

Abstract: Imbalanced and small data regimes are pervasive in domains such as rare
disease imaging, genomics, and disaster response, where labeled samples are
scarce and naive augmentation often introduces artifacts. Existing solutions
such as oversampling, focal loss, or meta-weighting address isolated aspects of
this challenge but remain fragile or complex. We introduce FOSSIL (Flexible
Optimization via Sample Sensitive Importance Learning), a unified weighting
framework that seamlessly integrates class imbalance correction,
difficulty-aware curricula, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics into a
single interpretable formula. Unlike prior heuristics, the proposed framework
provides regret-based theoretical guarantees and achieves consistent empirical
gains over ERM, curriculum, and meta-weighting baselines on synthetic and
real-world datasets, while requiring no architectural changes.

### [137] [On the Out-of-Distribution Backdoor Attack for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13219)
*Jiahao Xu,Zikai Zhang,Rui Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel OOD backdoor attack (OBA) using out-of-distribution data as triggers in federated learning, with stealth enhancement (SoDa) and defense method (BNGuard) that detects malicious updates via batch normalization statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional backdoor attacks in FL are limited by visible triggers and physical modifications, requiring more practical and stealthy approaches.

Method: OBA uses OOD data as poisoned samples and triggers; SoDa regularizes malicious local models to align with benign versions; BNGuard detects attacks via batch normalization layer statistics deviations.

Result: OBA effectively bypasses state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining main task accuracy; BNGuard successfully identifies and excludes malicious updates in various settings.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a practical OOD-based backdoor attack and corresponding defense method, demonstrating both the vulnerability and a solution for FL security.

Abstract: Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) operate within
constrained attack scenarios, as they depend on visible triggers and require
physical modifications to the target object, which limits their practicality.
To address this limitation, we introduce a novel backdoor attack prototype for
FL called the out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\mathtt{OBA}$), which
uses OOD data as both poisoned samples and triggers simultaneously. Our
approach significantly broadens the scope of backdoor attack scenarios in FL.
To improve the stealthiness of $\mathtt{OBA}$, we propose $\mathtt{SoDa}$,
which regularizes both the magnitude and direction of malicious local models
during local training, aligning them closely with their benign versions to
evade detection. Empirical results demonstrate that $\mathtt{OBA}$ effectively
circumvents state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining high accuracy on the
main task.
  To address this security vulnerability in the FL system, we introduce
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$, a new server-side defense method tailored against
$\mathtt{SoDa}$. $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ leverages the observation that OOD data
causes significant deviations in the running statistics of batch normalization
layers. This allows $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ to identify malicious model updates and
exclude them from aggregation, thereby enhancing the backdoor robustness of FL.
Extensive experiments across various settings show the effectiveness of
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$ on defending against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. The code is available
at https://github.com/JiiahaoXU/SoDa-BNGuard.

*Bo Yin,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NoRA is a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that adapts activation functions instead of weights, achieving comparable or better performance than full fine-tuning with only 0.4% parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods focus on adapting weight matrices while keeping activation functions fixed, leaving untapped potential in activation function adaptation for model fine-tuning.

Method: NoRA replaces fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients with group-wise design for localized adaptation and stability.

Result: Achieves accuracy gains of +0.17% on CIFAR-10 and +0.27% on CIFAR-100 with only 0.02M parameters (0.4% of total). NoRA++ outperforms LoRA and DoRA, and shows +0.3%-0.8% MMLU gains on LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning.

Conclusion: Activation-space tuning is a complementary and highly parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, establishing activation functions as first-class objects for model adaptation with implicit regularization benefits.

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily adapt
weight matrices while keeping activation functions fixed. We introduce
\textbf{NoRA}, the first PEFT framework that directly adapts nonlinear
activation functions in pretrained transformer-based models. NoRA replaces
fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured
low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients, with a group-wise
design that localizes adaptation and improves stability at minimal cost. On
vision transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds
full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4\% of parameters (0.02M), achieving
accuracy gains of +0.17\% and +0.27\%. When combined with LoRA
(\textbf{NoRA++}), it outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched training budgets
by adding fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++
consistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of
+0.3\%--0.8\%, including +1.6\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\% on OpenOrca. We
further show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional
subspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results
establish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly
parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation
functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.

*Zhizhong Zhao,Ke Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a post-hoc single-forward-pass framework for joint aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification using Split-Point Analysis and Mean Absolute Residuals, with applications to both regression and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty quantification methods are either computationally intensive (Bayesian/ensemble) or provide only partial, task-specific estimates. There's a need for efficient joint uncertainty estimation without model retraining.

Method: Uses Split-Point Analysis to decompose predictive residuals into upper/lower subsets, computes Mean Absolute Residuals, and introduces Self-consistency Discrepancy Score for epistemic uncertainty. Applies quantile regression for regression intervals and SPA-based calibration for classification probabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework matches or exceeds state-of-the-art UQ methods with minimal computational overhead across diverse regression and classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides efficient joint uncertainty quantification without model modification, offering improved empirical coverage for regression and calibrated probabilities for classification.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet
existing methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or
ensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as
single-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc
single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method
applies \emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals
into upper and lower subsets, computing \emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs)
on each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the
harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \emph{Self-consistency
Discrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across
regression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile
regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which
are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are
available, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax
outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities.
Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ
methods while incurring minimal overhead.

*Rodrigo M Carrillo-Larco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict nutritional values from text-only food descriptions using chain-of-thought prompting and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, achieving high accuracy for energy and macronutrients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most AI tools for nutritional estimation rely on image input, but text-based approaches could enable simpler dietary monitoring without photographs. The study explores whether LLMs can accurately predict nutritional values from text descriptions alone.

Method: Used 24-hour dietary recalls from NHANES adolescents. Applied open-source quantized LLM with 10-shot chain-of-thought prompting to estimate energy and macronutrients. Employed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to improve accuracy, using NHANES-calculated values as ground truth.

Result: Vanilla LLM performed poorly (MAE 652.08 for energy, Lin's CCC <0.46). Fine-tuned model performed substantially better with energy MAEs 171.34-190.90 and Lin's CCC >0.89 for all outcomes.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs with chain-of-thought prompting can accurately predict nutritional values from text-only dietary recalls, offering promise for low-burden, text-based dietary monitoring tools.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional
content rely on image input. However, whether large language models (LLMs) can
accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of
foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable
simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used
24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM
was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and
five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their
quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate
whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the
ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber
and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,
mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean
absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across
endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,
with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC
exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a
chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed
solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values
from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,
text-based dietary monitoring tools.

Motivation: Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated superhuman capabilities on complex information-seeking benchmarks, revealing a capability gap that open-source models lack - the ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast information landscapes.

Method: WebSailor uses a complete post-training pipeline involving: 1) generating novel high-uncertainty tasks through structured sampling and information obfuscation, 2) RFT cold start, and 3) an efficient agentic RL training algorithm called Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO).

Result: WebSailor significantly outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks and matches the performance of proprietary agents, effectively closing the capability gap.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology successfully instills the crucial capability of systematic uncertainty reduction in open-source models, enabling them to achieve performance parity with proprietary agentic systems on complex information-seeking benchmarks.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly

TL;DR: PromptSculptor is a multi-agent framework that automates iterative prompt optimization for text-to-image models, transforming vague user inputs into detailed prompts through collaborative specialized agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models require users to craft detailed prompts through multiple refinement rounds, which is time-consuming and challenging for non-experts.

Method: A four-agent framework using Chain-of-Thought reasoning: specialized agents collaboratively transform short prompts into comprehensive ones, with self-evaluation and feedback-tuning agents for iterative refinement.

Result: Significantly enhances output quality, reduces iteration count for user satisfaction, and works model-agnostically with various T2I models.

Conclusion: The framework successfully automates prompt optimization, making high-quality image generation more accessible and paving the way for industrial applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has democratized access to powerful
tools such as Text-to-Image models. However, to generate high-quality images,
users must still craft detailed prompts specifying scene, style, and
context-often through multiple rounds of refinement. We propose PromptSculptor,
a novel multi-agent framework that automates this iterative prompt optimization
process. Our system decomposes the task into four specialized agents that work
collaboratively to transform a short, vague user prompt into a comprehensive,
refined prompt. By leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning, our framework
effectively infers hidden context and enriches scene and background details. To
iteratively refine the prompt, a self-evaluation agent aligns the modified
prompt with the original input, while a feedback-tuning agent incorporates user
feedback for further refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that
PromptSculptor significantly enhances output quality and reduces the number of
iterations needed for user satisfaction. Moreover, its model-agnostic design
allows seamless integration with various T2I models, paving the way for
industrial applications.

TL;DR: Introduces k-proportionality as a scale between proportional and envy-free cake division, showing impossibility results for k ‚â§ n-1 in connected pieces scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between proportional and envy-free division concepts and understand where difficulties in fair division lie by introducing a scalable intermediate concept.

Method: Proposes k-proportionality framework where k=n corresponds to proportional division and k=2 to envy-free division, then analyzes impossibility theorems for various k values.

Result: Shows no k-proportional and equitable division exists for k ‚â§ n-1 with connected pieces, and no Pareto-optimal k-proportional division exists for k ‚â§ n-1 with connected pieces.

Conclusion: k-proportionality provides a unified framework to generalize theorems about fair division and reveals that impossibility results occur even with weaker notions than envy-freeness.

Abstract: This article deals with the cake cutting problem. In this setting, there
exists two notions of fair division: proportional division (when there are n
players, each player thinks to get at least 1/n of the cake) and envy-free
division (each player wants to keep his or her share because he or she does not
envy the portion given to another player). Some results are valid for
proportional division but not for envy-free division. Here, we introduce and
study a scale between the proportional division and the envy-free division. The
goal is to understand where is the gap between statements about proportional
division and envy-free division. This scale comes from the notion introduced in
this article: k-proportionality. When k = n this notion corresponds to the
proportional division and when k = 2 it corresponds to envy-free division. With
k-proportionality we can understand where some difficulties in fair division
lie. First, we show that there are situations in which there is no
k-proportional and equitable division of a pie with connected pieces when k
$\le$ n -1. This result was known only for envy-free division, ie k = 2. Next,
we prove that there are situations in which there is no Pareto-optimal
k-proportional division of a cake with connected pieces when k $\le$ n -1. This
result was known only for k = 2. These theorems say that we can get an
impossibility result even if we do not consider an envy-free division but a
weaker notion. Finally, k-proportionality allows to give a generalization with
a uniform statement of theorems about strong envy-free and strong proportional
divisions.
