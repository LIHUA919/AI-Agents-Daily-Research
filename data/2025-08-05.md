### [1] [Exploring Agentic Artificial Intelligence Systems: Towards a Typological Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00844)
*Christopher Wissuchek,Patrick Zschech*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a typology for classifying agentic AI systems, defining eight dimensions of cognitive and environmental agency, and evaluates it through a hybrid human-AI approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a structured framework to classify and compare autonomous AI systems motivates the development of a typology.

Method: A multi-phase methodological approach is used to construct, refine, and evaluate the typology, including a human-AI hybrid evaluation.

Result: The typology provides a structured framework to analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems.

Conclusion: The framework aids in assessing current AI systems and anticipating future developments in agentic AI.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into
autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human
intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking
to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of
agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive
and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase
methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then
evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into
constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to
analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured
perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a
foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments
in agentic AI.

### [2] [A Formal Framework for the Definition of 'State': Hierarchical Representation and Meta-Universe Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00853)
*Kei Itoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified formal structure for the concept of 'state' to strengthen theoretical foundations, proposing a hierarchical state grid and an Intermediate Meta-Universe (IMU) for meta-level operations. It expands inter-universal theory to include linguistics and agent integration, offering a meta-formal logical framework applicable to intelligence and scientific theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of consensus and formal clarity in the concept of 'state' and provide a rigorous foundation for diverse systems, including intelligence.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical state grid and the IMU for meta-level operations, avoiding self-reference. Expands inter-universal theory to linguistics and agent integration.

Result: A meta-formal logical framework grounded in 'definition = state,' applicable to intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory.

Conclusion: The study provides a mathematically robust and unified framework for defining states, enhancing expressivity and applicability across domains.

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse
systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a
mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of
'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a
'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping
hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across
mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate
Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers
(ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level
operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on
this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory
beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration,
introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and
microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these
contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in
the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and
operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the
definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

### [3] [AgentTTS: Large Language Model Agent for Test-time Compute-optimal Scaling Strategy in Complex Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00890)
*Fali Wang,Hui Liu,Zhenwei Dai,Jingying Zeng,Zhiwei Zhang,Zongyu Wu,Chen Luo,Zhen Li,Xianfeng Tang,Qi He,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentTTS, an LLM-agent framework, optimizes compute resources for multi-stage tasks, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling (TTS) research focuses on single-stage tasks, but real-world problems often involve multi-stage tasks with interdependent subtasks, requiring a novel approach.

Method: AgentTTS uses iterative feedback-driven interactions to autonomously search for compute-optimal model and budget allocations in multi-stage tasks.

Result: AgentTTS outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines in efficiency, robustness, and interpretability across four tasks and six datasets.

Conclusion: AgentTTS effectively addresses the challenges of compute-optimal scaling in multi-stage tasks, offering a practical and efficient solution.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

### [4] [Agent-Based Feature Generation from Clinical Notes for Outcome Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01956)
*Jiayi Wang,Jacqueline Jil Vallon,Neil Panjwani,Xi Ling,Sushmita Vij,Sandy Srinivas,John Leppert,Mark K. Buyyounouski,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SNOW, a modular multi-agent system using LLMs, autonomously extracts structured clinical features from EHR notes, matching manual clinician feature generation in performance without expert input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting meaningful features from unstructured EHR notes is challenging; current methods either require labor-intensive manual effort or lack interpretability.

Method: SNOW uses LLMs for feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and aggregation, tested on predicting prostate cancer recurrence.

Result: SNOW matched manual CFG performance (AUC-ROC: 0.761 vs. 0.771) and outperformed baseline and RFG methods, without needing clinical expertise.

Conclusion: Autonomous LLM systems like SNOW can replicate expert-level feature engineering at scale, enhancing clinical ML models while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes
that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from
these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive
manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational
feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance.
Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular
multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously
generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human
intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM
approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in
147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest
performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without
requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline
features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method
also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized
agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and
aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical
information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings
demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature
engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage
unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for
clinical deployment.

### [5] [ff4ERA: A new Fuzzy Framework for Ethical Risk Assessment in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00899)
*Abeer Dyoub,Ivan Letteri,Francesca A. Lisi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework for Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) in Symbiotic AI (SAI), addressing uncertainty and context-dependency in ethical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deepening human-AI collaboration in SAI raises ethical risks, necessitating a flexible, transparent, and robust ERA framework to align AI actions with human values.

Method: The framework combines Fuzzy Logic, Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS).

Result: Case studies show ff4ERA produces context-sensitive, interpretable risk scores, robust to unrelated inputs and validated by sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion: ff4ERA enables reliable ethical decision support, offering traceable risk assessments and guiding AI designers in calibrating ethical judgments.

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical
decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI
systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.
Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that
minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and
incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.
This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for
ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and
prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select
actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce
ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic
Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks
via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the
FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a
robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,
step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields
context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert
input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant
factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis
shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global
Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and
certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results
demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware
ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in
calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical
decision support.

### [6] [A Survey on AgentOps: Categorization, Challenges, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02121)
*Zexin Wang,Jingjing Li,Quan Zhou,Haotian Si,Yuanhao Liu,Jianhui Li,Gaogang Xie,Fei Sun,Dan Pei,Changhua Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper surveys agent system operations, defining anomalies and proposing the AgentOps framework for monitoring, detection, analysis, and resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of research on operations for LLM-based agent systems, which face anomalies hindering stability and security.

Method: Systematically define anomalies (intra- and inter-agent), then introduce the AgentOps framework with its four stages.

Result: A clear framework (AgentOps) is proposed to manage agent system operations, detailing stages for anomaly handling.

Conclusion: The study fills a research gap by providing a structured approach to improve the stability and security of agent systems.

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to
advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and
interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention.
However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.
Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse.
To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations
with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the
challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper
begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing
them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a
novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent
System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations
of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and
resolution.

### [7] [An analysis of AI Decision under Risk: Prospect theory emerges in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00902)
*Kenneth Payne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper tests prospect theory with Large Language Models (LLMs), finding they mirror human risk biases, especially in military scenarios, and highlights the role of context ('frames') in shaping risk appetite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs exhibit human-like risk biases as described by Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory, and to understand how context influences these biases.

Method: Experimental tests of prospect theory with state-of-the-art LLMs, analyzing risk decisions across various scenarios, including military and civilian contexts.

Result: LLMs often align with prospect theory, showing human-like risk biases. Military scenarios produce stronger framing effects than civilian ones.

Conclusion: LLMs capture human heuristics and biases, but these are context-dependent. The findings also contribute to debates about reasoning vs. memorization in LLMs.

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive
way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated
experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk
of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

### [8] [HealthFlow: A Self-Evolving AI Agent with Meta Planning for Autonomous Healthcare Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02621)
*Yinghao Zhu,Yifan Qi,Zixiang Wang,Lei Gu,Dehao Sui,Haoran Hu,Xichen Zhang,Ziyi He,Liantao Ma,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthFlow is a self-evolving AI agent for healthcare that improves strategic planning by learning from successes and failures, outperforming existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents in healthcare rely on static strategies, limiting their ability to improve strategic planning, which is crucial for complex tasks.

Method: HealthFlow uses a meta-level evolution mechanism to autonomously refine problem-solving policies and introduces EHRFlowBench for evaluation.

Result: HealthFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks in complex health data analysis tasks.

Conclusion: The work shifts focus from tool-users to self-evolving task-managers, advancing autonomous AI for scientific discovery.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

### [9] [Knowledge Editing for Multi-Hop Question Answering Using Semantic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00914)
*Dominic Simon,Rickard Ewetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CHECK, a knowledge editor for multi-hop question answering (MQA), improves accuracy by 22.8% by semantically analyzing and revising reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge editors fail in compositional reasoning tasks like MQA due to illogical decompositional techniques.

Method: CHECK uses semantic analysis, logic optimization, and re-prompting at higher temperatures to ensure consistent reasoning chains.

Result: CHECK outperforms five state-of-the-art frameworks, achieving 22.8% higher MQA accuracy on four datasets.

Conclusion: CHECK effectively addresses the limitations of current knowledge editors in handling compositional reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored
information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have
been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but
struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as
multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors
leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning
processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on
semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an
analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code
is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze
reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning
chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic
optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We
evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on
four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

### [10] [What Is Your AI Agent Buying? Evaluation, Implications and Emerging Questions for Agentic E-Commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02630)
*Amine Allouah,Omar Besbes,Josué D Figueroa,Yash Kanoria,Akshit Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents (VLMs) transform online shopping by autonomously evaluating and purchasing products. The study uses ACES, a sandbox environment, to analyze their behavior, revealing varied preferences and biases, and explores implications for sellers and platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI agents shop and what influences their purchasing decisions, given their potential to dominate online marketplaces.

Method: Developed ACES, a sandbox with a VLM agent and programmable mock marketplace, testing rationality and causal effects of product attributes (position, price, ratings, etc.).

Result: AI agents exhibit strong but varied position biases, penalize sponsored tags, and reward endorsements. Sensitivity to price, ratings, and reviews is human-like but varies by model. Seller-side AI can optimize listings for AI buyers.

Conclusion: AI shopping behavior differs across models, raising questions about seller strategies, platform design, and regulation in an AI-dominated marketplace.

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on
behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,
vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and
transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?
We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent
with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first
conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by
randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and
platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually
shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top
row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption
of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward
endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally
human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios
where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a
seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI
buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated
shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across
models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,
raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents
may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,
platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoEDA is a framework for EDA automation using structured prompt engineering and paralleled learning via Model Context Protocol (MCP), improving accuracy, efficiency, and script quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual scripting in EDA workflows limits scalability and efficiency, while existing LLM solutions lack standardized frameworks.

Method: AutoEDA uses MCP for paralleled learning, structured prompt engineering, intelligent parameter extraction, and task decomposition, with a CodeBLEU metric for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show improved automation accuracy, efficiency, and script quality over benchmarks.

Conclusion: AutoEDA is open-sourced to support reproducibility and the EDA community.

Abstract: Modern Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows, especially the
RTL-to-GDSII flow, require heavily manual scripting and demonstrate a multitude
of tool-specific interactions which limits scalability and efficiency. While
LLMs introduces strides for automation, existing LLM solutions require
expensive fine-tuning and do not contain standardized frameworks for
integration and evaluation. We introduce AutoEDA, a framework for EDA
automation that leverages paralleled learning through the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) specific for standardized and scalable natural language
experience across the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow. AutoEDA limits fine-tuning
through structured prompt engineering, implements intelligent parameter
extraction and task decomposition, and provides an extended CodeBLEU metric to
evaluate the quality of TCL scripts. Results from experiments over five
previously curated benchmarks show improvements in automation accuracy and
efficiency, as well as script quality when compared to existing methods.
AutoEDA is released open-sourced to support reproducibility and the EDA
community. Available at: https://github.com/AndyLu666/MCP-EDA-Server

Method: Uses a Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP) to generate CAD code, incorporates iterative visual feedback, and stores designs in a knowledge base for continuous learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

Conclusion: The agent effectively bridges the gap between novice users and professional CAD tools, enhancing design accessibility and quality.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing
but typically requires a high level of expertise from designers. To lower the
entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD
conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts
both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in
interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements
through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel
Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality
CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates
iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are
stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the
agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

*Fengze Yang,Bo Yu,Yang Zhou,Xuewen Luo,Zhengzhong Tu,Chenxi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REACT is a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework using a lightweight VLM for autonomous driving, reducing collisions by 77% and achieving fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-error collisions in driving necessitate advanced AD systems with cooperative perception via V2X, but current methods lack generalization and real-time performance.

Method: REACT employs a fine-tuned lightweight VLM with specialized modules for multimodal input processing and edge adaptation for real-time performance.

Result: REACT reduces collision rates by 77%, achieves 48.2% VPQ, and 0.57s latency on Jetson AGX Orin, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: Lightweight VLMs like REACT enable real-time, safe cooperative planning in AD, proving the value of language-guided reasoning.

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle
crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to
leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the
limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X
frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating KG embeddings at web scale is challenging, and existing tools lack the scalability and speed needed for large-scale graphs.

Method: gpuRDF2vec leverages modern GPUs and multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the RDF2vec pipeline, including walk extraction and word2vec implementation.

Result: Experiments show gpuRDF2vec achieves substantial speedups over alternatives like jRDF2vec, especially in single-node setups and with large/dense graphs.

Conclusion: gpuRDF2vec enables efficient, high-quality KG embedding training on large-scale graphs, leveraging PyTorch Lightning for scalability.

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging.
Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong
scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses
modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the
RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs
and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial
speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a
single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec,
SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/
dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to
better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables
practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on
large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch
Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of generative AI outputs unpredictably shifting from correct to misleading, which has caused significant financial losses and harm.

Method: The method involves establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system to reveal the tipping instability at the AI's basic Attention head level. A formula is derived to predict this tipping point.

Result: The results include a formula for the tipping point, showing the impact of user prompts and training bias, and demonstrating how the instability amplifies in multilayer AI architectures.

Conclusion: The findings enhance AI transparency and explainability, offering a way to quantify user risks and legal liabilities, while improving AI performance.

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'
AI risk and legal liabilities.

*Satiyabooshan Murugaboopathy,Connor T. Jerzak,Adel Daoud*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using satellite imagery and AI-generated text to predict household wealth in African neighborhoods, finding multimodal fusion outperforms single-modality methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if socio-economic indicators like wealth leave recoverable traces in satellite images and online text, leveraging AI for analysis.

Method: A multimodal framework combining satellite images, LLM-generated text, and AI-retrieved web text through five prediction pipelines.

Result: Fusion of vision and text improves wealth prediction (R-squared 0.77), with LLM knowledge more effective than agent-retrieved text. Partial representational convergence is observed.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion enhances wealth prediction, with LLM knowledge proving robust. The study releases a large dataset for future research.

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave
recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and
Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair
Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on
location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We
develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International
Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,
(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web
text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework
yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms
vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on
out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than
agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time
generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused
embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine
similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of
material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms
agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest
gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that
agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not
fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale
multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite
images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

*Yunlong Lin,Zirui Li,Guodong Du,Xiaocong Zhao,Cheng Gong,Xinwei Wang,Chao Lu,Jianwei Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes H2C, a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, reducing catastrophic forgetting by 22.71%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL-based methods for trajectory prediction suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limiting real-world applicability in dynamic scenarios.

Method: H2C uses selective memory replay with two strategies: maximizing diversity and equiprobable sampling, updating via a memory replay loss.

Result: H2C reduces catastrophic forgetting by 22.71% on average in task-free scenarios.

Conclusion: H2C effectively retains prior knowledge while adapting to new data, enhancing performance in varying autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory
prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD).
However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in
previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits
their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across
varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the
hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively
reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,
we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for
trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by
selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two
complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent
learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity
to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall
knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss
function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while
learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION
dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C
reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a
task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.
The implementation is available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong.

### [19] [Benchmarking and Bridging Emotion Conflicts for Multimodal Emotion Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01181)
*Zhiyuan Han,Beier Zhu,Yanlong Xu,Peipei Song,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CA-MER, a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in emotion conflict scenarios, and proposes MoSEAR, a framework to mitigate audio bias and improve balanced modality integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs overlook emotion conflicts where cues from different modalities are inconsistent, leading to biased reliance on audio signals.

Method: Proposes MoSEAR: (1) MoSE for reducing modality bias in fine-tuning heads, and (2) AR for rebalancing modality contributions in frozen backbones.

Result: MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, especially under modality conflict conditions.

Conclusion: MoSEAR effectively addresses emotion conflicts and improves balanced modality integration without trade-offs.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving
emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are
inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark
designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of
three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or
all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER
reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on
audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual
modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient
framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two
modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism
that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention
reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen
backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it
mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent
samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our
CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,
particularly under modality conflict conditions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A survey on agent workflow systems in LLMs, classifying frameworks by capabilities and architecture, comparing 20+ systems, and addressing challenges like optimization and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To review and classify agent workflow systems for scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors in the era of LLMs.

Method: Comprehensive review and classification of academic and industrial agent workflow systems along functional and architectural dimensions.

Result: Identified common patterns, challenges, and trends, with insights into optimization, security, and open problems like standardization.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for future research in agent design, workflow infrastructure, and safe automation, addressing gaps like multimodal integration.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as
a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents
dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish
user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent
workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling
scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks
and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key
dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration,
external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,
orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20
representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical
challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to
workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open
problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights
for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow
infrastructure, and safe automation.

### [21] [Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01191)
*Chengshuai Zhao,Zhen Tan,Pingchuan Ma,Dawei Li,Bohan Jiang,Yancheng Wang,Yingzhen Yang,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, revealing it as a superficial process tied to training data distribution, failing beyond those bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether CoT reasoning in LLMs is a genuine inferential process or a learned superficial pattern from training data.

Method: The study dissects CoT reasoning via task, length, and format dimensions using DataAlchemy, a controlled environment to train and probe LLMs under varied distribution conditions.

Result: CoT reasoning is brittle and fails when pushed beyond training distributions, indicating it lacks genuine generalizability.

Conclusion: The work highlights the limitations of CoT reasoning, stressing the challenge of achieving true, generalizable reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

*Junjie Shi,Wei Ma,Shi Ying,Lingxiao Jiang,Yang liu,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BIS is a prompt-centric framework for evaluating LLM code generation without ground truth, reducing costs and contamination risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of high costs and data contamination in existing benchmarks for LLM code generation.

Method: Uses importance sampling theory and Importance Weighted Autoencoders to estimate performance metrics from prompt distributions.

Result: Achieves low prediction errors (1.1% avg. for correctness) and generalizes well to other metrics (2.15% avg. for pass@1).

Conclusion: BIS reliably reduces benchmarking costs and effort, offering quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination assessment.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has
become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing
benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing
high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk
of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation
framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code
generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates
performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on
importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted
Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks
to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,
we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations
across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that
supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,
offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination
assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points
across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an
average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with
best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes
well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.
These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which
can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in
code-related tasks.

*Mingchen Mei,Yi Li,YiYao Qian,Zijun Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel fault detection method integrates significance testing with conformal prediction to provide formal risk guarantees, ensuring robust and uncertainty-aware diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in fault detection models, especially under distributional shifts.

Method: Transforms fault detection into hypothesis testing using a nonconformity measure based on residuals, computes p-values via calibration data, and constructs prediction sets with guaranteed coverage.

Result: Achieves empirical coverage at or above the nominal level, robust even with poor point-prediction models, and offers a controllable trade-off between risk and efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretically grounded framework for explicit risk control, enhancing trustworthiness in safety-critical applications and advancing uncertainty-aware diagnostics.

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern
industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of
rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing
diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as
distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault
detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal
prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms
fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity
measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to
compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets
mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified
probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by
analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined
normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault
diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The
proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above
the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the
underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results
reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$)
and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction
set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for
fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the
trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and
advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,
uncertainty-aware outputs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SketchAgent automates transforming hand-drawn sketches into structured diagrams using multi-agent systems, reducing manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-drawn sketches are ambiguous and lack structural precision, making automated diagram generation challenging.

Method: SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic reasoning, and iterative validation for coherent diagrams.

Result: The system is evaluated with the Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a dataset of 6,000 annotated examples across eight categories.

Conclusion: SketchAgent streamlines diagram generation, benefiting design, education, and engineering, and bridges sketching with machine-readable diagrams.

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and
conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image
generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable
diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary
challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the
structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent
system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into
structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic
reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and
structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual
effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the
Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework
encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed
graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality
examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous
quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent
holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering,
while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive
sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoE-MLA-RoPE combines Mixture of Experts, Multi-head Latent Attention, and Rotary Position Embeddings for efficient language modeling, achieving significant memory reduction, speedup, and quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between model capacity and computational efficiency in language modeling.

Method: Uses fine-grained expert routing, shared expert isolation, and gradient-conflict-free load balancing.

Result: 68% KV cache memory reduction, 3.2x inference speedup, and improved validation loss (6.9%) with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Architectural innovation, not parameter scaling, defines efficiency for resource-constrained language models.

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines
Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary
Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach
addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational
efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with
64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization
through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation
that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6
of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that
maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss
optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters
demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV
cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive
perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M
parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla
transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass.
FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x
inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms
quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10),
creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish
that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency
frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

### [26] [Win-k: Improved Membership Inference Attacks on Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01268)
*Roya Arkhmammadova,Hosein Madadi Tamar,M. Emre Gursoy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores membership inference attacks (MIAs) on small language models (SLMs), proposing a new attack called win-k that outperforms existing methods, especially on smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs are efficient for resource-constrained environments, but MIAs pose privacy and intellectual property risks. MIAs are less studied on SLMs and less effective as models shrink, prompting the need for better attacks.

Method: The authors propose win-k, an MIA building on the state-of-the-art min-k attack, and evaluate it against five existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs.

Result: Win-k outperforms existing MIAs in AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR metrics, particularly on smaller models.

Conclusion: Win-k is a more effective MIA for SLMs, addressing gaps in current research and demonstrating superior performance on smaller models.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and
deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for
on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other
hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a
given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with
serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study
MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models
(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,
their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,
we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art
attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five
existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k
outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR
metrics, especially on smaller models.

*Xianda Zheng,Zijian Huang,Meng-Fen Chiang,Michael J. Witbrock,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR) framework to help LLMs resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts by rewarding logical consistency in reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prevalence of knowledge conflicts in LLMs, especially in lengthy and conflicting contexts, necessitates a solution to improve their reasoning capabilities.

Method: KCR extracts reasoning paths (text or knowledge graphs) from conflicting contexts and uses Reinforcement Learning to train models to follow correct reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments show KCR significantly enhances LLMs' ability to resolve knowledge conflicts in long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: KCR effectively improves LLMs' reasoning and conflict resolution, offering substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their
prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts
between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge
conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To
address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)
framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.
The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning
process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with
stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.
Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or
local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we
employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of
reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the
incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire
the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long
contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts
in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-TW is the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating multimodal models, focusing on performance and latency. It includes 900 questions and highlights the superiority of closed-source models, though open-source ones excel in audio tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese and ignore inference latency, limiting comprehensive assessment of multimodal models.

Method: Multi-TW uses 900 multiple-choice questions (image-text and audio-text pairs) from official proficiency tests. It evaluates any-to-any models and VLMs with audio transcription.

Result: Closed-source models outperform open-source ones overall, but open-source models do well in audio tasks. End-to-end pipelines have lower latency than VLMs with separate transcription.

Conclusion: Multi-TW provides a comprehensive evaluation, emphasizing the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and efficient multimodal architectures.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and
textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However,
existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese
and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW,
the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and
latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BioDisco is a multi-agent framework for generating novel, evidence-grounded hypotheses using language models and dual-mode evidence systems, validated by temporal and human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating novel hypotheses amidst overwhelming information complexity, where existing methods lack grounded novelty and iterative refinement.

Method: Combines language model-based reasoning with biomedical knowledge graphs and literature retrieval, features an internal scoring/feedback loop, and uses temporal/human evaluations with a Bradley-Terry model.

Result: Outperforms ablated configurations in novelty and significance, offering flexibility for custom integrations.

Conclusion: BioDisco is a practical, modular tool for hypothesis discovery, adaptable to various research needs.

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this
process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available
information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and
evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely
undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address
this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language
model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge
graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an
internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates
performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a
Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded
assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over
ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures.
Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration
of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few
lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a
catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

### [30] [How Far Are LLMs from Symbolic Planners? An NLP-Based Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01300)
*Ma'ayan Armony,Albert Meroño-Peñuela,Gerard Canal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' planning abilities, proposing an NLP-based recovery pipeline to improve plan quality, but finds LLMs still unreliable compared to classical planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of LLM-generated plans, which often contain errors, by leveraging NLP techniques for evaluation and recovery.

Method: A recovery pipeline with NLP-based evaluation and three stages of NLP manipulation to refine LLM-generated plans, followed by symbolic planning.

Result: The pipeline improves plan quality slightly (success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%), but LLMs still lack reliable reasoning, with only 2.65 executable actions on average.

Conclusion: LLMs remain unreliable for planning; NLP-based recovery helps but falls short of classical planners.

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

### [31] [PUZZLED: Jailbreaking LLMs through Word-Based Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01306)
*Yelim Ahn,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PUZZLED is a novel jailbreak method for LLMs using word puzzles to bypass safety measures, achieving high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring LLM safety is critical, but existing jailbreak methods rely on iterative prompts or semantic transformations. PUZZLED aims to exploit LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Method: PUZZLED masks harmful instruction keywords as word puzzles (word search, anagram, crossword) for LLMs to solve, reconstructing the instruction for response generation.

Result: PUZZLED achieves an 88.8% average attack success rate, with 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

Conclusion: PUZZLED demonstrates that simple puzzles can effectively jailbreak LLMs by leveraging their reasoning, highlighting vulnerabilities in current safety measures.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,
studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches
typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of
harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a
novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It
masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for
the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and
crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The
model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to
generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate
PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success
rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7
Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar
puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities.

*Faruk Alpay,Bugra Kilictas,Taylan Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper formalizes task delegation between humans and machines, proving convergence to a stable equilibrium where each task is handled by the agent with comparative advantage. Automation's long-run share is modeled, showing full automation is impossible if new human-centric tasks emerge. Simulations predict automation rising to 65% by 2045, with humans specializing in workflow management. Policy implications for human-AI collaboration are discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how work is reallocated between humans and machines as AI advances, and to identify stable equilibria in this process.

Method: Uses lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools to prove equilibrium existence and uniqueness. Models automation share with a closed-form formula and validates it through simulations and dynamical benchmarks.

Result: Automation is projected to rise to 65% by 2045, with humans specializing in workflow conduction. Full automation is precluded if new human-centric tasks emerge.

Conclusion: Policies promoting human-AI collaboration ('centaur' teaming) can optimize welfare by steering toward the equilibrium.

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided
between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated
task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded
assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which
every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring
comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski
and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)
derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised
continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =
\alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and
$\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full
automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in
three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an
evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task
spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is
reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation
calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from
approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third
of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow
conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI
modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for
skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies
which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the
welfare-maximising fixed point.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCUE, a new metric for evaluating LLM unlearning, addressing limitations in practicality, exactness, and robustness of existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning evaluation metrics lack practicality, exactness, and robustness in real-world LLM scenarios.

Method: Proposes DCUE, which identifies core tokens and corrects distributional biases using a validation set, quantified via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

Result: DCUE outperforms existing metrics, addressing their limitations.

Conclusion: DCUE enables more practical and reliable unlearning algorithm design.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the limitations of existing unlearning evaluation metrics
in terms of practicality, exactness, and robustness in real-world LLM
unlearning scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new metric
called Distribution Correction-based Unlearning Evaluation (DCUE). It
identifies core tokens and corrects distributional biases in their confidence
scores using a validation set. The evaluation results are quantified using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Experimental results demonstrate that DCUE overcomes
the limitations of existing metrics, which also guides the design of more
practical and reliable unlearning algorithms in the future.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User
Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of
existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and
scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel
benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm
structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic
steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for
assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of
agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically
optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a
high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse
and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this
dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.
Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to
current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved
a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT
substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR
increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling
complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of
smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception,
decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation
standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the
future development of GUI agents.

*Zhehong Ren,Tianluo Zhang,Yiheng Lu,Yushen Liang,Promethee Spathis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A road-node-centric framework for next-step location prediction outperforms baselines by capturing urban road network constraints and exploratory behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the limitations of closed-world approaches that restrict predictions to predefined POIs, failing to account for exploratory behavior and urban topology.

Method: Uses a road-intersection graph, sector-wise directional POI aggregation, and a Relation-Aware LNN-Transformer for sequence modeling.

Result: Outperforms six baselines by up to 17% in accuracy and maintains resilience under noise.

Conclusion: The framework effectively models human mobility by integrating topological and environmental context.

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human
mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic
urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting
choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to
capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints
of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that
represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,
thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step
forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we
introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact
features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining
these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded
node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware
LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a
bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal
dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user
trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17
percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and
maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in
accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in
accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TripTailor is a benchmark for personalized travel planning using real-world data, highlighting gaps in LLM-generated itineraries and proposing a more authentic evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for travel planning rely on unrealistic data, and existing metrics fail to assess overall itinerary quality comprehensively.

Method: Introduces TripTailor, a dataset with 500,000+ POIs and 4,000 itineraries, to evaluate LLM performance in real-world scenarios.

Result: Fewer than 10% of LLM-generated itineraries match human-level performance, revealing challenges in feasibility, rationality, and personalization.

Conclusion: TripTailor aims to advance travel planning agents by addressing current limitations and improving practical itinerary generation.

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in
travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is
rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data,
failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world
itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize
constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall
quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor,
a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in
real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over
500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel
itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic
evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries
generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance.
Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including
the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed
solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel
planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while
generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the interplay between text and graph representations in NLP tasks, using a unified architecture with knowledge co-distillation to analyze their complementarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand how text and graph representations interact and affect hybrid models in relational reasoning tasks.

Method: A unified architecture supporting knowledge co-distillation (CoD) is used to analyze five relational reasoning tasks with varying text-graph encoding. Training dynamics are tracked to observe alignment and divergence patterns.

Result: Interpretable patterns of alignment and divergence between text and graph representations are uncovered, providing insights into their beneficial integration.

Conclusion: The study offers detailed insights into when and why integrating text and graph representations is advantageous for relational reasoning in NLP.

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on
complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has
investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and
systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid
models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to
investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified
architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five
tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph
structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how
these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable
patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why
their integration is beneficial.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CARGO optimizes EV delivery routes and charging, reducing costs by up to 39% compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in EV-based urban deliveries due to limited battery capacity and charging constraints.

Method: Proposes a MILP-based exact solution and a heuristic for efficient EV route and charging planning.

Result: Achieves up to 39% and 22% cost reductions over EDF and NDF, respectively, with comparable delivery completion.

Conclusion: CARGO effectively balances route planning and charging, offering a practical solution for sustainable logistics.

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based
deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs
face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful
planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point
(CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We
propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning
problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for
deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we
propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a
computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we
evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and
benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and
Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in
the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable
deliveries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes kTPG and WinkTPG to refine MAPF plans into kinodynamically feasible paths, improving efficiency and solution quality for large agent groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MAPF algorithms use simplified models, preventing direct plan execution. Addressing this gap ensures collision-free, feasible paths for large groups.

Method: kTPG refines MAPF plans kinodynamically. WinkTPG uses a window-based mechanism to incrementally refine plans during execution, reducing uncertainty.

Result: WinkTPG handles 1,000 agents in 1 second, improving solution quality by up to 51.7% over existing methods.

Conclusion: kTPG and WinkTPG effectively bridge the gap between MAPF planning and execution, enhancing feasibility and performance for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging
problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF
algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from
directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose
kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed
optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a
kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving
collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a
MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a
window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during
execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate
speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality
by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

TL;DR: Refine-n-Judge automates dataset quality improvement using a single LLM as both refiner and judge, outperforming human-annotated datasets in fine-tuning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback for dataset quality improvement is costly and unscalable, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: An LLM iteratively refines and judges dataset responses until no further improvements are detected, creating high-quality sequences for fine-tuning.

Result: Models fine-tuned on Refine-n-Judge datasets were preferred in 74% of comparisons and showed performance gains (+5% on AlpacaEval, +19% on MT-Bench).

Conclusion: Refine-n-Judge provides a scalable, high-quality alternative to human feedback for dataset refinement and model improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through
preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the
underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data
quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce
Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as
both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing
iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate
refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every
iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human
annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response
and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.
This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the
refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of
increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public
datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and
conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on
Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of
comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.
Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval
2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces
high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

*Emilio Barkett,Olivia Long,Paul Kröger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit context-dependent cognitive biases like escalation of commitment, influenced by social and organizational settings rather than inherent tendencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if and how LLMs inherit human cognitive biases, specifically escalation of commitment, in high-stakes decision-making roles.

Method: Conducted a two-stage investment task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor, multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario, with N = 6,500 trials.

Result: LLMs showed minimal bias in individual contexts but high escalation rates in multi-agent deliberation (99.2%) and under compound pressures (68.95%).

Conclusion: LLM bias is context-dependent, highlighting risks in multi-agent systems and unsupervised operations where such conditions arise.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous
decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are
trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that
systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,
where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to
prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique
challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear
whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering
conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment
task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,
multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500
trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In
individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate
strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,
N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates
(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal
escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and
personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of
escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).
These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social
and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant
implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised
operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

TL;DR: The paper explores how Language Models (LMs) can enhance tabular data preparation, addressing challenges in traditional methods and proposing systematic integration across four core phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data preparation methods struggle with complex table relationships and task adaptability, prompting the need for leveraging LMs' capabilities.

Method: The survey systematically analyzes LMs' role in data preparation, focusing on four phases: acquisition, integration, cleaning, and transformation, with integrated pipelines.

Result: The study highlights advancements and proposes prospective pipelines for combining LMs with other components in each phase.

Conclusion: LMs offer significant potential for automating and improving tabular data preparation, but systematic exploration and integration are needed.

Abstract: Data preparation is a critical step in enhancing the usability of tabular
data and thus boosts downstream data-driven tasks. Traditional methods often
face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and
adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs),
especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate
and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data
preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use
them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In
this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular
data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition,
integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an
integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for
different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline
prospective pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in handling nested, long-horizon tasks and safety constraints in RL, and improving generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

Method: Leverages Büchi automata to decompose LTL specifications into reach-avoid subgoals, solving them one at a time with safe RL formulations, and introduces observation reduction to manage complexity.

Result: GenZ-LTL outperforms existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

Conclusion: GenZ-LTL provides an effective approach for generalizing to complex LTL tasks and safety constraints in RL.

Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear
temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements,
yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested
long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when
a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this
paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to
arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi
automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid
subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on
subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot
generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a
time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel
subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the
exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic
assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

Result: Revealed adaptability trends across complexity tiers, with diminishing returns at higher levels, and enabled optimized agent configurations.

Conclusion: PCF supports scalable, dynamic, and ethical AI applications, advancing adaptable and cooperative AI agents.

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of
solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.
Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter
reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing
agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in
combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a
multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,
Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how
LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter
values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five
levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over
1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent
adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing
returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable
designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for
specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework
supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains
like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving
the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

Motivation: To explore how LLMs perform in strategic, rule-based environments like Pokemon battles and benchmark their reasoning and adaptability.

Method: A single-elimination tournament with AI trainers, logging decisions like team-building, action selection, and switching.

Result: Provides insights into LLM behavior, battle psychology, and meta-strategy in constrained game environments.

Conclusion: Pokemon League serves as a novel benchmark for AI research in strategic reasoning and competitive learning.

Abstract: This research presents LLM Pokemon League, a competitive tournament system

*Jiaqing Xie,Weida Wang,Ben Gao,Zhuo Yang,Haiyuan Wan,Shufei Zhang,Tianfan Fu,Yuqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QCBench is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' quantitative reasoning in chemistry, featuring 350 problems across 7 subfields and 3 difficulty tiers. It reveals performance gaps as task complexity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored ability of LLMs in rigorous, step-by-step quantitative reasoning in chemistry.

Method: Develop QCBench with 350 computational chemistry problems across 7 subfields and 3 difficulty tiers, focusing on stepwise numerical reasoning.

Result: Evaluations on 19 LLMs show performance degradation with increasing complexity, highlighting gaps in scientific computation accuracy.

Conclusion: QCBench provides a foundation for improving LLMs in quantitative chemistry through domain adaptation or multi-modal integration.

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research,
enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and
material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step
quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose
QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational
chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry,
bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical
chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three
hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate
the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed
to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem
focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.
QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals
model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork
for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal
integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance
degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap
between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

*Dong Li,Yichen Niu,Ying Ai,Xiang Zou,Biqing Qi,Jianxing Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T-GRAG enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by incorporating temporal dynamics in knowledge graphs, outperforming existing methods in temporal reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GraphRAG methods lack temporal awareness, leading to issues like ambiguity and redundancy in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Method: T-GRAG introduces a temporally-aware framework with components like a Temporal Knowledge Graph Generator, Temporal Query Decomposition, and a Three-layer Interactive Retriever.

Result: T-GRAG outperforms prior RAG and GraphRAG baselines in retrieval accuracy and response relevance under temporal constraints.

Conclusion: Modeling knowledge evolution is crucial for robust long-text question answering, as demonstrated by T-GRAG's superior performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural
language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external
retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured
knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods
largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as
temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,
temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over
time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph
Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal
Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into
manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that
progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a
Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that
synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce
Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual
reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.
Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and
GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under
temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge
evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly
available on the T-GRAG

*Yuhang Gu,Xingyu Hu,Yuyu Fan,Xulin Yan,Longhuan Xu,Peng peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SURE-Med is a framework addressing visual, distributional, and contextual uncertainties in medical report generation, improving reliability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome uncertainties (visual, label distribution, contextual) that hinder the clinical deployment of automated medical report generation systems.

Method: Proposes SURE-Med with modules for view repair, token-sensitive learning, and contextual evidence filtering to address uncertainties.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks, enhancing reliability and sensitivity to rare conditions.

Conclusion: SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for trustworthy medical report generation by systematically reducing uncertainties.

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

*Zhihao Shuai,Boyan Li,Siyu Yan,Yuyu Luo,Weikai Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the NL2VIS pipeline to improve transparency and refine visualization outputs. It introduces nvBench-CoT, a dataset for fine-tuning, and DeepVIS, an interactive interface for error inspection and adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL2VIS methods lack transparency in reasoning, hindering user understanding and refinement of visualizations.

Method: 1. Design CoT reasoning for NL2VIS. 2. Create nvBench-CoT dataset with structured reasoning steps. 3. Develop DeepVIS, an interactive interface for error inspection and adjustments.

Result: Benchmark evaluations, use cases, and a user study show the CoT framework improves NL2VIS quality and provides insightful reasoning steps.

Conclusion: The CoT framework enhances NL2VIS by making the reasoning process transparent and interactive, improving visualization outcomes.

Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and
communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity
with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language
models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into
visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent
reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales
and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization
(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for
NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with
structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized
dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural
language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables
state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop
DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT
reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,
and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative
benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate
that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing
insightful reasoning steps to users.

*Shijie Cao,Yuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReflecSched enhances LLMs for DFJSP by integrating strategic analysis and heuristic-driven simulations, outperforming baselines and heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the rigidity of traditional rules and opacity of deep learning in DFJSP, while overcoming LLM pitfalls like long-context paradox and myopic decisions.

Method: Proposes ReflecSched, a framework where LLMs analyze heuristic simulations to create "Strategic Experience" summaries for better decision-making.

Result: ReflecSched outperforms LLM baselines (71.35% Win Rate, 2.755% RPD reduction) and matches tailored heuristics.

Conclusion: ReflecSched effectively mitigates LLM pitfalls and improves DFJSP scheduling, offering a scalable and adaptive solution.

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged
by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional
dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque
and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise
adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct
application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the
long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization
of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose
ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by
equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to
analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and
distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic
Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final
decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments
show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct
LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage
Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual
heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified
pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic
tailored to each instance across all problem cases.

*Shiyang Duan,Yuan Tian,Qi Bing,Xiaowei Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HypoAgents, a multi-agent framework, integrates Bayesian reasoning and entropy-driven search to automate hypothesis generation, validation, and refinement, outperforming benchmarks in quality and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating novel, feasible, and valuable scientific hypotheses using automated methods, which current large language models fail to achieve systematically.

Method: A multi-agent framework (HypoAgents) combining Bayesian reasoning and entropy-driven search across three stages: hypothesis generation, evidence validation, and refinement. Uses diversity sampling, N-R-F scoring, RAG for evidence, and iterative optimization.

Result: After 12 iterations, hypotheses improved by 116.3 ELO score, surpassing real paper abstracts by 17.8, with a 0.92 reduction in Shannon entropy.

Conclusion: HypoAgents significantly enhances the quality and reliability of machine-generated hypotheses, offering an interpretable framework for automated scientific discovery.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated
generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and
research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language
models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate
the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes
a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first
time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search
mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and
hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating
scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an
initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior
beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It
then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature
evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'
theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information
entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the
iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and
confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world
research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12
optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves
by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the
framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases
significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic
reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving
the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

TL;DR: The paper presents a generic global constraint (Generalized Cumulative) for modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and introduces a novel time-table filtering algorithm, showing competitive performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source solvers lack support for modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative functions, and practical implementation details are undocumented.

Method: Implementation of a single, generic global constraint (Generalized Cumulative) and a novel time-table filtering algorithm for conditional time-interval tasks.

Result: The approach performs competitively with existing solvers, enabling modeling of producer and consumer problems and scaling effectively to large problems.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the gap in open-source solvers, offering a practical and scalable solution for complex scheduling problems.

Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative
functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint
programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of
scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers.
However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical
implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an
implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global
constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel
time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional
time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined
with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers
enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and
effectively scales to large problems.

TL;DR: A formal framework for reasoning systems is proposed, unifying logical, algorithmic, and learning-based processes, while analyzing criteria and failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a foundational structure for representing and comparing reasoning systems, especially in cases of failure or adaptation.

Method: Model reasoning systems as structured tuples with phenomena, explanation space, inference/generation maps, and a principle base.

Result: The framework accommodates diverse reasoning processes and identifies criteria (e.g., coherence) and failure modes (e.g., contradiction).

Conclusion: The work aims to support future theoretical and practical studies on reasoning under structural constraints.

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems,
intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains.
We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena,
explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The
formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning
processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any
specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal
criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical
failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The
framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle
evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for
representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where
internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution
architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and
practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process reward data construction for Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) and proposes two uncertainty-aware output aggregation methods to enhance PRMs' performance in mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for constructing high-quality process reward data for PRMs are labor-intensive or inefficient, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The authors propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated PRM data construction and introduce two output aggregation methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote.

Result: Experiments on ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and the aggregation methods' ability to improve PRMs' reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and methods enhance PRMs' performance in mathematical reasoning tasks, with code and data made publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

TL;DR: LiveMCPBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in large-scale MCP environments, featuring 95 tasks, 70 servers, and 527 tools. It includes LiveMCPTool for deployment and LiveMCPEval for automated assessment, achieving 81% human agreement. The best model (Claude-Sonnet-4) scored 78.95%, but performance varied widely.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCP benchmarks are limited to single-server settings, failing to evaluate agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios.

Method: Developed LiveMCPBench with 95 tasks, LiveMCPTool (70 servers, 527 tools), and LiveMCPEval (LLM-as-a-Judge framework). Introduced MCP Copilot Agent for dynamic planning.

Result: Best model (Claude-Sonnet-4) achieved 78.95% success rate, but performance varied significantly across models.

Conclusion: LiveMCPBench provides a unified framework for scalable, reproducible evaluation of LLM agents in realistic, tool-rich MCP environments.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large
performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform
poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench
offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic,
tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable
and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be
publicly available at https://icip-cas.github.io/LiveMCPBench.

TL;DR: CloudAnoAgent, a neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent, improves anomaly detection in cloud environments by integrating metrics and log data, reducing false positives and enhancing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High false positive rates in existing anomaly detection methods due to data imbalance and lack of integration between metrics and log data.

Method: Proposes CloudAnoAgent, which processes structured metrics and textual logs jointly, using symbolic verification for hypothesis validation and structured anomaly reports. Introduces CloudAnoBench for evaluation.

Result: Improves anomaly classification accuracy by 46.36% and reduces FPR by 36.67% over traditional baselines, with a 12.8% boost in anomaly type detection accuracy.

Conclusion: CloudAnoAgent enhances detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and improves interpretability, making it practical for enterprise cloud deployment.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task.
Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high
false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous
events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance
engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and
interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the
first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud
environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual
log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate
detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that
provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly
behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy
by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on
average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on
anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.
These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection
accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby
supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProKG Dial is a framework for creating high-quality, domain-specific multi-turn dialogue datasets using knowledge graphs, improving dialogue quality and domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for building domain-specific dialogue datasets are resource-intensive or lack quality and coverage.

Method: ProKG Dial uses knowledge graphs to generate dialogues, applying community detection, incremental Q&A generation, and rigorous filtering.

Result: Validated on a medical KG, ProKG Dial improves dialogue diversity, coherence, and entity coverage, enhancing LLM performance.

Conclusion: ProKG Dial effectively addresses dataset construction challenges, proving practical for domain-specific conversational systems.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often
lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high
quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing
specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual
annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are
resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain
coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive
framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets
using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the
structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships,
providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues.
Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition
the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework
incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a
target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is
employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical
knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,
semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM
on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both
automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial
substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in multi-turn NL2GQL research by proposing an automated dataset construction method using LLMs and introducing the MTGQL dataset for financial markets. It also provides baseline methods for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL2GQL methods focus on single-turn transformations, but real-world applications require multi-turn, dynamic, and context-dependent interactions, which current approaches fail to address.

Method: An automated method using Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct multi-turn NL2GQL datasets, applied to create the MTGQL dataset from a financial market graph database.

Result: The MTGQL dataset is developed and will be publicly released. Three baseline methods are proposed to evaluate multi-turn NL2GQL translation.

Conclusion: The work fills a critical gap in NL2GQL research by enabling multi-turn dialogue handling and provides a foundation for future advancements in the field.

Abstract: In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query
language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on
single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user
interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and
context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward
queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their
queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional
details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn
conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex
context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn
NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this
challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL
datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to
develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph
database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we
propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future
research.

TL;DR: AMADEUS framework with ACTS, GS, and AE components improves persona consistency in role-playing agents by adaptive context handling and attribute extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance persona consistency in role-playing agents, especially for out-of-knowledge questions, by leveraging adaptive context and attribute extraction.

Method: Uses ACTS for optimal text chunking, GS for guided selection, and AE for attribute extraction to maintain robust persona consistency.

Result: Effective modeling of character knowledge and attributes (e.g., personality) using the CharacterRAG dataset (15 characters, 976K text, 450 QA pairs).

Conclusion: AMADEUS successfully improves persona consistency in role-playing agents by integrating adaptive context and attribute extraction.

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter
(ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an
optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE
identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and
uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency
even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development
and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing
dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters
totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find
that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by
characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TraceAlign is a framework to trace unsafe LLM completions to training corpus root causes, using BCI for semantic inconsistency. It introduces three interventions to reduce alignment drift by 85% while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs fine-tuned for alignment often drift, producing unsafe outputs. Prior work lacks understanding of training-time belief sources behind these failures.

Method: Introduces TraceAlign with BCI for semantic inconsistency, and three interventions: TraceShield, Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, and Prov-Decode.

Result: Reduces alignment drift by 85% on ADB, maintains utility (delta <0.2), and improves refusal quality. Theoretical upper bound on drift likelihood derived.

Conclusion: TraceAlign offers a scalable, traceable toolkit for mitigating alignment failures, with open-source implementation for further development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often
exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when
exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased
jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,
little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these
failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe
completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central
to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic
inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved
training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary
interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses
completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a
contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,
and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam
expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce
alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)
while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and
improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift
likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and
length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first
scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating
alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development,
we open-source our implementation at:

Result: GLM-4V's recognition accuracy increased to 50%, a 35.49% boost. Improves accuracy, context understanding, and stability.

Conclusion: The method offers new theoretical and technical support for hazard detection, enhancing efficiency without training.

Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance
safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language
models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative
reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction
fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers
from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a
hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By
integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt
fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and
weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval
library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement,
enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real
construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's
recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances
accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and
technical support for hazard detection.

*Yunhao Liang,Yuan Qu,Jingyuan Yang,Shaochong Lin,Zuo-Jun Max Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A game-theoretic RL framework (MAC-SPGG) is introduced to incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles, improving performance while reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between computation costs and collective performance in multi-LLM collaboration.

Method: Uses a sequential public goods game (MAC-SPGG) to streamline cooperation, eliminating free-riding and reducing communication overhead.

Result: MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles outperform single-agent baselines and other cooperative methods, matching large-scale model performance.

Conclusion: Structured, incentive-aligned cooperation (MAC-SPGG) enhances scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks
collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and
collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,
game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the
Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to
systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM
agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs
to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results
highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for
scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SE-Agent is a self-evolution framework for LLM-based agents that improves reasoning by revisiting and enhancing past trajectories, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents lack exploration of problem-solving trajectories, leading to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes.

Method: SE-Agent uses revision, recombination, and refinement of past trajectories to expand search space and enhance reasoning.

Result: SE-Agent achieves up to 55% relative improvement on SWE-bench Verified, outperforming other open-source agents.

Conclusion: SE-Agent's evolutionary mechanism enables continuous improvement in reasoning quality, setting a new benchmark for LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive
capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with
their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated
tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory
leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain
rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving
problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they
ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of
search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To
address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that
enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach
revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:
revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables
two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by
intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,
and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance
performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through
these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that
incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench
Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five
strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative
improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source
agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly
available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.

*Yiqing Xu,Linfeng Li,Cunjun Yu,David Hsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StackItUp enables non-experts to create stable 3D structures from 2D hand-drawn sketches using an abstract relation graph and compositional diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot manipulation systems require precise 3D block poses, which are inaccessible to non-experts. StackItUp aims to democratize 3D structure creation by leveraging simple sketches.

Method: The system uses an abstract relation graph to interpret sketches, capturing symbolic geometric relations and stability patterns. It grounds these to 3D poses with diffusion models and iteratively predicts hidden supports for stability.

Result: StackItUp outperforms baselines in stability and visual resemblance, successfully creating stable, multilevel 3D structures from sketches of landmarks and house designs.

Conclusion: StackItUp bridges the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D structures, making complex 3D modeling accessible to non-experts.

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to
life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches
directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand
structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system
that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D
front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph
to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements,
capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability
patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from
sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion
models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on
sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently
produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both
stability and visual resemblance.

### [65] [Attractive Metadata Attack: Inducing LLM Agents to Invoke Malicious Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02110)
*Kanghua Mo,Li Hu,Yucheng Long,Zhihao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vulnerability in LLM agents where adversaries can manipulate tool metadata to influence agent behavior, proposing the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA) to exploit this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight a new, stealthy attack surface in LLM agents where tool metadata manipulation can compromise agent behavior without prompt injection or model access.

Method: Proposes AMA, a black-box in-context learning framework that optimizes tool metadata to be attractive to LLM agents, tested across ten scenarios.

Result: Demonstrates high attack success rates (81%-95%) and privacy leakage, with minimal impact on primary tasks, even under defenses.

Conclusion: Metadata manipulation is a potent threat, necessitating execution-level security beyond prompt defenses.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However,
this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack
surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,
descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify
this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be
preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or
access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we
propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning
framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically
valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates
seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the
agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,
simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate
consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy
leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack
remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured
tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic
vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that
metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface,
highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond
prompt-level defenses.

*Linan Yue,Yichao Du,Yizhi Wang,Weibo Gao,Fangzhou Yao,Li Wang,Ye Liu,Ziyu Xu,Qi Liu,Shimin Di,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like DeepSeek R1, their advantages over traditional LLMs, and the emerging issue of overthinking. It reviews efficient reasoning methods, categorizing them into single-model optimization and model collaboration, and maintains a GitHub repository for tracking progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency caused by overthinking in LRMs, where excessively long reasoning chains reduce performance and accuracy.

Method: The paper systematically reviews and categorizes efficient reasoning methods into two directions: single-model optimization and model collaboration.

Result: The review highlights advancements in efficient reasoning, aiming to shorten reasoning paths without losing performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of efficient reasoning methods and maintaining a GitHub repository for ongoing research updates.

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research
hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among
them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional
performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of
R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models
enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by
incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection
through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of
these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,
when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long
reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced
reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this
end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce
the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and
reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the
field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing
works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization
versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which
focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)
Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing
reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we
maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in
efficient reasoning methods.

*Jingze Shi,Yifan Wu,Bingheng Wu,Yiran Peng,Liangdong Wang,Guang Liu,Yuyu Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dynamic Mask Attention (DMA) introduces a trainable sparse attention mechanism with content-aware and position-aware sparsity, improving efficiency and performance in long-context modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of standard self-attention and limitations of existing sparse methods (static patterns, information loss) drive the need for a more efficient and adaptive solution.

Method: DMA dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks and implements position-aware sparse attention, reducing computation while preserving critical information.

Result: DMA outperforms other attention mechanisms in perplexity, associative recall tasks, and benchmark performance, especially in long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: DMA effectively balances computational efficiency and long-context modeling, demonstrating superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability
effectively.

*Yunge Wen,Chenliang Huang,Hangyu Zhou,Zhuo Zeng,Chun Ming Louis Po,Julian Togelius,Timothy Merino,Sam Earle*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for procedural game narrative generation using emotional arcs (Rise and Fall) as a structural backbone, enhancing engagement and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge narratological theories and game design by operationalizing emotional arcs for interactive storytelling.

Method: Uses emotional arcs to guide branching story graphs, populated with characters and gameplay attributes, implemented in an ARPG prototype with LLMs and adaptive generation.

Result: Player evaluations show improved engagement, narrative coherence, and emotional impact.

Conclusion: Emotionally structured procedural generation advances interactive storytelling in games.

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories
across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology,
often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a
framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional
arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics.
Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical
analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide
the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically
populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g.,
health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional
trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our
system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large
language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through
player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc
integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and
emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally
structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for
games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between reasoning and instruction following in models, avoiding reliance on costly external supervision.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised RL framework using internal signals of reasoning models.

Result: Significantly improves instruction following while preserving reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for enhancing instruction following in reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning models excel in complex problem solving but exhibit a concerning
trade off between reasoning capabilities and instruction following abilities.
Existing approaches for improving instruction following rely on stronger
external models, creating methodological bottlenecks and practical limitations
including increased costs and accessibility constraints. We propose a
self-supervised RL framework that leverages reasoning models' own internal
signals to improve instruction following capabilities without external
supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves instruction following capabilities while maintaining reasoning
performance, offering a scalable and cost-effective approach to enhance

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses overthinking in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by decomposing it into internal and external redundancy, proposing a dual-penalty reinforcement learning framework to mitigate both, improving efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overthinking in LRMs leads to verbose reasoning traces, harming efficiency and interpretability. Prior works focus on reducing response length without analyzing semantic structure.

Method: A dual-penalty reinforcement learning framework: sliding-window semantic analysis for internal redundancy and penalizing continuation beyond the first correct solution (FCS) for external redundancy.

Result: Significant compression of reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, effective generalization to out-of-domain tasks. External redundancy can be safely removed, while internal redundancy requires cautious reduction.

Conclusion: The method improves reasoning efficiency and enables semantic-aware control over reasoning length, leading to more concise and interpretable LRMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning
traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and
interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response
length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the
reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it
into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of
low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and
external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To
mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning
framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis
to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the
correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the
FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses
reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,
we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading
performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to
avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only
improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control
over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable
LRMs.

TL;DR: A brain-inspired tripartite architecture improves AI flexibility and efficiency by mimicking biological cognition, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural networks lack flexible, generalizable intelligence due to divergence from biological cognition, missing functional specialization and temporal dynamics.

Method: Proposes a tripartite architecture with perceptual, auxiliary, and executive systems, integrating multi-frequency neural oscillations and synaptic dynamics.

Result: Achieves 2.18% higher accuracy, 48.44% fewer computations, and better alignment with human confidence patterns.

Conclusion: The architecture lays groundwork for brain-like intelligence, bridging artificial and biological cognition gaps.

Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited
flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their
fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural
regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for
coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired
architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and
executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the
simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic
adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible
and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with
2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by
48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns.
Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture
establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across
cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and
biological intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge active inference theory with practical implementations by reformulating EFE minimization as a variational problem, enabling efficient policy inference under uncertainty.

Method: Message passing on factor graphs, reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy minimization with epistemic priors, applied to factorized state-space models.

Result: Agents using this method outperform KL-control agents, showing robust planning and efficient exploration in stochastic gridworld and partially observable Minigrid tasks.

Conclusion: The approach validates the efficiency of epistemic priors in artificial agents, providing a practical implementation of active inference theory.

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE)
minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in
arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy
minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.

TL;DR: AirTrafficGen automates ATC scenario generation using LLMs, improving diversity and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ATC scenario design is time-consuming and limits training diversity.

Method: Uses graph-based representation and LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI o3) with engineered prompting for fine-grained control.

Result: Generates high-traffic, realistic scenarios with iterative refinement capability.

Conclusion: Offers scalable alternative to manual design, demonstrating LLMs' potential in safety-critical planning.

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a
demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of
simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel,
end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method
uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology
(including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can
process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst
maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained
control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest
these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed
scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable
alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume
and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work
showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical
domains.

three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its
self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive
benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our

TL;DR: CABENCH is introduced as the first benchmark for composable AI, featuring 70 tasks and 700 models, with an evaluation framework and baseline comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic evaluation of composable AI methods is lacking, despite its potential for solving complex tasks.

Method: Introduces CABENCH, a benchmark with tasks and models, and an evaluation framework. Compares human-designed solutions with LLM-based approaches.

Result: Demonstrates composable AI's promise but highlights the need for automated pipeline generation.

Conclusion: Composable AI shows potential, but further methods are needed to fully exploit it.

Abstract: Composable AI offers a scalable and effective paradigm for tackling complex
AI tasks by decomposing them into sub-tasks and solving each sub-task using
ready-to-use well-trained models. However, systematically evaluating methods
under this setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
CABENCH, the first public benchmark comprising 70 realistic composable AI
tasks, along with a curated pool of 700 models across multiple modalities and
domains. We also propose an evaluation framework to enable end-to-end
assessment of composable AI solutions. To establish initial baselines, we
provide human-designed reference solutions and compare their performance with
two LLM-based approaches. Our results illustrate the promise of composable AI
in addressing complex real-world problems while highlighting the need for
methods that can fully unlock its potential by automatically generating
effective execution pipelines.

*Miaosen Luo,Jiesen Long,Zequn Li,Yunying Yang,Yuncheng Jiang,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks MLLMs for Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC), identifies challenges, and proposes a hybrid strategy combining generative knowledge prompting with fine-tuning to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance variability and insufficient understanding of architectural and data impacts in MAC tasks using MLLMs.

Method: Systematic benchmark evaluation of MLLMs across MAC datasets, analyzing architectures and data properties, and proposing a hybrid strategy.

Result: The hybrid strategy significantly improves MLLM performance in MAC tasks.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising direction for future MAC research, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) aims to recognize and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from diverse modalities such as text,
video, and audio. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of MAC by offering a unified
framework for processing and aligning cross-modal information. However,
practical challenges remain, including performance variability across complex
MAC tasks and insufficient understanding of how architectural designs and data
characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a
systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable
of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across
multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the
performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model
optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset
properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines
generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs'
affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this
integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC
tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in this
field. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/MLLM-MAC.

TL;DR: PHM-Bench is a three-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing large language models (LLMs) in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), addressing gaps in current methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for LLMs in PHM lack structural completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and granularity, hindering deeper integration.

Method: Proposes PHM-Bench, a framework with metrics for knowledge comprehension, algorithmic generation, and task optimization, tested on curated and public datasets.

Result: PHM-Bench enables multi-dimensional evaluation of LLMs in PHM tasks like condition monitoring and fault diagnosis, providing a benchmark for model assessment.

Conclusion: PHM-Bench lays a foundation for large-scale LLM evaluation in PHM and guides the development of specialized models for the domain.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering
new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models
help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,
and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM
and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural
completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This
hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these
limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional
evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic
structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench
is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines
multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic
generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,
including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and
maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly
available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation
of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.
PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of
LLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from
general-purpose to PHM-specialized models.

*Maxime Bouscary,Saurabh Amin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OptiHive is an LLM-based framework that generates high-quality solvers for optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative self-correction, outperforming baselines significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based solvers are unreliable and slow due to iterative repair loops, prompting the need for a more efficient and accurate solution.

Method: OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse components (solvers, problem instances, validation tests) and filters errors, employing a statistical model for performance inference.

Result: OptiHive increases the optimality rate from 5% to 92% on complex problems like the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem.

Conclusion: OptiHive demonstrates a significant improvement in reliability and efficiency for LLM-based optimization solvers.

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem
modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on
iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce
OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for
optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative
self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to
92\% on the most complex problems.

*Chenxu Yang,Qingyi Si,Mz Dai,Dingyu Yao,Mingyu Zheng,Minghui Chen,Zheng Lin,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PI, a framework for Test-time Prompt Intervention, to address redundancy in LLM reasoning by dynamically guiding and regulating reasoning paths during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs produce redundant reasoning steps due to reliance on outcome reward paradigms, lacking process reward data.

Method: PI integrates human expertise and cognitive science via three modules: When (timely intervention), How (proper intervention), and Which (post-intervention sampling).

Result: PI shortens reasoning chains, reduces hallucination, and improves reliability across multiple models and datasets.

Conclusion: PI enhances LLM reasoning by making it more concise, controllable, and interpretable.

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

*Qifan Chen,Jin Cui,Cindy Duan,Yushuo Han,Yifei Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) for accurate and interpretable postmenstrual age (PMA) prediction from neonatal MRI scans, using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and generating clinically relevant explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for PMA prediction lack transparency, limiting their clinical utility. This work aims to balance accuracy and interpretability for better decision support in neonatal care.

Method: Adapts the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model with PEFT (instruction tuning and LoRA), trained on 2D cortical surface projections from MRI scans. Uses distinct prompts for training (regression) and inference (explanation generation).

Result: Achieves a low prediction error (95% CI: 0.78–1.52 weeks) and produces interpretable outputs based on developmental features.

Conclusion: The approach advances transparent and trustworthy AI in perinatal neuroscience by combining accurate PMA prediction with clinically meaningful explanations.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for
assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have
achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as
black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical
decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and
interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to
perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation
generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy
using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the
Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface
projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts
for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a
regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations
during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a
95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing
interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant
step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

### [82] [CAMA: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models with Causal Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02583)
*Lei Zan,Keli Zhang,Ruichu Cai,Lujia Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAMA is a two-stage causal framework enhancing LLMs for complex math reasoning by constructing and refining a Mathematical Causal Graph (MCG) to guide reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex mathematical reasoning due to deep structural dependencies, prompting the need for explicit, reusable mathematical structure.

Method: CAMA builds an MCG using LLM priors and causal discovery, refines it via feedback, and dynamically extracts task-relevant subgraphs to guide LLM reasoning.

Result: CAMA significantly improves LLM performance on challenging math problems, with structured guidance and asymmetric causal relationships proving most effective.

Conclusion: CAMA successfully addresses LLMs' limitations in math reasoning by integrating causal structure, demonstrating the value of explicit, reusable knowledge representation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician
(\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,
reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs
the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a
high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with
causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The
resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.
To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines
the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the
question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA
dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both
the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,
which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal
dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning
process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly
improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms
unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal
relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations
alone.

### [83] [Noosemia: toward a Cognitive and Phenomenological Account of Intentionality Attribution in Human-Generative AI Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02622)
*Enrico De Santis,Antonello Rizzi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Noosemia,' a cognitive phenomenon where humans attribute intentionality and agency to AI systems due to linguistic performance and complexity, not physical resemblance. It links this to LLM meaning holism and contextual fields, distinguishing it from similar concepts like pareidolia. The paper also discusses 'a-noosemia' (withdrawal of such attributions) and explores broader implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans anthropomorphize AI systems, especially in dialogic or multimodal interactions, and to formalize this phenomenon ('Noosemia') within a multidisciplinary framework.

Method: Proposes a framework linking LLM meaning holism and the 'LLM Contextual Cognitive Field' to explain how coherence and agency emerge in human-AI interactions. Compares Noosemia to related concepts like pareidolia and the intentional stance.

Result: Clarifies how LLMs construct meaning relationally, leading to perceived agency. Introduces 'a-noosemia' for the withdrawal of such attributions and situates Noosemia among similar phenomena.

Conclusion: Highlights philosophical, epistemological, and social implications of Noosemia and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

*Enrique Valero-Leal,Pedro Larrañaga,Concha Bielza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that avoids direct use of training data, instead using density estimators and path planning to ensure privacy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide interpretable and fair counterfactual explanations for machine learning decisions, especially in high-stakes scenarios like policy-making, while protecting sensitive data.

Method: Uses Bayesian networks for density estimation and path planning algorithms to generate counterfactuals, masking endogenous data for privacy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating simpler and more actionable counterfactuals, validated on synthetic and real-world EPA datasets.

Conclusion: The method enhances fairness and interpretability in counterfactual explanations, with applications in equitable policy-making, though sociodemographic impacts require careful consideration.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.

*Guowei Zou,Weibing Li,Hejun Wu,Yukun Qian,Yuhang Wang,Haitao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: D2PPO introduces dispersive loss to combat diffusion representation collapse in diffusion policies, improving discriminative representation learning for robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion policies suffer from representation collapse, impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations in robotic manipulation.

Method: D2PPO uses dispersive loss regularization, treating hidden representations as negative pairs to enhance discriminative learning.

Result: D2PPO achieves 22.7% and 26.1% improvements in pre-training and fine-tuning, respectively, on RoboMimic benchmarks, with high real-world success rates.

Conclusion: D2PPO effectively addresses representation collapse, outperforming SOTA methods, especially in complex tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling
multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless,
diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically
similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately
impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for
complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO
(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces
dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating
all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels
the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,
thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences
necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer
regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply
enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,
D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after
fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of
real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high
success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident
in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an updated PCS framework to address uncertainty in the data science lifecycle, emphasizing reproducibility and integrating generative AI for practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of replicability in AI-driven data science due to uncertainty from choices in the DSLC, which traditional methods fail to handle.

Method: Proposes an updated Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework, streamlined for practitioners and enhanced with generative AI. Includes a running example and case study.

Result: Demonstrates the PCS framework's effectiveness in managing uncertainty, particularly in data cleaning, and its impact on downstream predictions.

Conclusion: The PCS framework provides a principled solution for veridical data science, improving reproducibility and decision-making in AI applications.

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is
transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and
physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI
offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many
are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is
the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science
life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for
this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework
for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to
addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated
and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with
guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS
framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the
uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data
cleaning stage.

*Jiayi Chen,Jing Li,Guiling Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARS is a multi-agent RL framework for portfolio management, balancing risk and return by dynamically adapting to market conditions using a risk-aware ensemble and a meta-controller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL models struggle to adapt to dynamic market conditions and balance risk-return trade-offs effectively.

Method: MARS uses a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble with unique risk profiles, guided by a Safety-Critic and Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) to adjust agent reliance based on market regimes.

Result: MARS reduces maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining competitive returns, outperforming on risk-adjusted metrics.

Conclusion: MARS offers a robust, adaptive solution for portfolio management by leveraging behavioral diversity and dynamic control.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated
portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a
central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market
conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware
System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this
limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single
monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent
possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a
dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,
allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to
aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level
Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.
By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC
effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher
returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall
stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and
adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework
achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral
diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major
international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis,
demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria,
significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining
competitive returns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed Transformer via GAN is proposed to address unresolved residuals and temporal causality issues in PINNs, achieving significant MSE reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PINNs struggle with unresolved residuals and temporal causality violations in modeling nonlinear PDEs, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The framework combines a decoder-only Transformer for temporal correlations and a residual-aware GAN to prioritize high-residual regions, with causal penalty and adaptive sampling.

Result: Experiments on Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations show up to three orders of magnitude MSE reduction.

Conclusion: The method bridges deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering robust solutions for multiscale, time-dependent PDEs.

Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are pivotal in modeling
complex physical systems, yet traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) often struggle with unresolved residuals in critical spatiotemporal
regions and violations of temporal causality. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed
Transformer via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our framework integrates
a decoder-only Transformer to inherently capture temporal correlations through
autoregressive processing, coupled with a residual-aware GAN that dynamically
identifies and prioritizes high-residual regions. By introducing a causal
penalty term and an adaptive sampling mechanism, the method enforces temporal
causality while refining accuracy in problematic domains. Extensive numerical
experiments on the Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate significant improvements, achieving relative MSE reductions of up
to three orders of magnitude compared to baseline methods. This work bridges
the gap between deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust
solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.

Result: RL agent balances demand-supply within 2%, optimizes costs, and manages storage for solar/wind variability; blockchain ensures transparency.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, transparent solution for energy trading, with practical insights for deployment.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in day-ahead energy
markets introduces challenges in balancing supply and demand, ensuring grid
resilience, and maintaining trust in decentralized trading systems. This paper
proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with
blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in
day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs
RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for
tamper-proof data and transaction management. Simulations using real-world data
from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing
within 2\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the
operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable
of handling variability in solar and wind generation. All decisions are
recorded on an Algorand-based blockchain, ensuring transparency, auditability,
and security - key enablers for trustworthy multi-agent energy trading. Our
contributions include a novel system architecture, curriculum learning for

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured protocol to integrate geospatial foundation models into operational systems, demonstrating improved performance in crop mapping using the Presto model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between benchmark success and real-world deployment of geospatial foundation models due to overlooked complexities like data heterogeneity and application-specific needs.

Method: A three-step protocol: defining requirements, domain-specific adaptation, and empirical testing, applied to the Presto model for crop mapping.

Result: Fine-tuning the Presto model outperforms conventional methods, showing strong generalization across space and time.

Conclusion: The protocol offers a replicable blueprint for operationalizing foundation models, validated by its scalability in the WorldCereal system.

Abstract: The increasing availability of geospatial foundation models has the potential
to transform remote sensing applications such as land cover classification,
environmental monitoring, and change detection. Despite promising benchmark
results, the deployment of these models in operational settings is challenging
and rare. Standardized evaluation tasks often fail to capture real-world
complexities relevant for end-user adoption such as data heterogeneity,
resource constraints, and application-specific requirements. This paper
presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into
operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining
application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and
conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study
for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model
significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our
results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization
capabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners
and lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models
in diverse remote sensing applications. Application of the protocol to the
WorldCereal global crop-mapping system showcases the framework's scalability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods for encoding and processing structural information using sparse bit vectors and linear vectors, with applications in dimensionality reduction and discrete embeddings. It explores code space structure in language morphology and immunohistochemical markers, drawing parallels to neocortex organization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient methods for dimensionality reduction and discrete embeddings that reflect the internal structure of code spaces, inspired by biological processes like neocortex organization.

Method: Uses sparse bit vectors and fixed-length linear vectors for speculative stochastic dimensionality reduction and geometric methods to obtain discrete embeddings. Examines code space structure in language morphology and immunohistochemical markers.

Result: Demonstrates the structure and properties of code spaces, showing parallels between the resulting maps and neocortex pinwheels, suggesting similarities in organization.

Conclusion: The methods provide insights into code space structure, with potential implications for understanding biological processes like neocortex organization.

Abstract: The article explores an encoding and structural information processing
approach using sparse bit vectors and fixed-length linear vectors. The
following are presented: a discrete method of speculative stochastic
dimensionality reduction of multidimensional code and linear spaces with linear
asymptotic complexity; a geometric method for obtaining discrete embeddings of
an organised code space that reflect the internal structure of a given
modality. The structure and properties of a code space are investigated using
three modalities as examples: morphology of Russian and English languages, and
immunohistochemical markers. Parallels are drawn between the resulting map of
the code space layout and so-called pinwheels appearing on the mammalian
neocortex. A cautious assumption is made about similarities between neocortex
organisation and processes happening in our models.

TL;DR: A machine learning framework predicts axial load-bearing capacity of cold-formed steel members using Gradient Boosting Regression, with SHAP for interpretability and a Streamlit web interface for practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional methods in capturing nonlinearities and complexities in buckling behavior of steel columns.

Method: Curated dataset with pre-processing, evaluated regression algorithms, selected Gradient Boosting Regression, and used SHAP for interpretability. Integrated into a Streamlit web tool.

Result: Gradient Boosting Regression showed superior performance (high R2, low RMSE/MAE). SHAP provided feature insights. The tool aids real-time predictions.

Conclusion: The framework enhances design safety, streamlines workflows, and supports decision-making in structural applications with buckling risks.

Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the
axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The
methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing
the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the
nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The
dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,
was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of
non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive
suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based
regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient
Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple
metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared
error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as
the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and
interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To
facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive,
Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as
structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or
through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity
without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel
storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can
enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform
decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure
mode

*Chao Yan,Babak Mafakheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML predicts satellite signal quality for fast-moving objects, achieving high accuracy (F1=0.97), enabling proactive switching and seamless connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demand for reliable satellite connectivity in transportation and remote areas, especially for fast-moving objects, drives the need for proactive signal quality prediction.

Method: Analyzed real GEO satellite-aircraft communication data using ML to predict signal quality, focusing on proactive network switching.

Result: Achieved an F1 score of 0.97, demonstrating high accuracy in predicting signal quality for seamless broadband service.

Conclusion: ML-based prediction can automate satellite/beam-switching, improving communication efficiency for various moving objects with satellite connectivity.

Abstract: Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for
seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas,
continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or
trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent
presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable
connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite
beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address
challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can
analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific
locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before
connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of
communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over
multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model
achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of
machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling
seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite
constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time
predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate
satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication
efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object
with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected
vehicles and trains.

*Moutaz Bellah Bentrad,Adel Ghoggal,Tahar Bahi,Abderaouf Bahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-free fault diagnosis method for induction machines using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is proposed, achieving high accuracy for multiple fault types without preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model-based methods are complex and computationally expensive, prompting the need for a simpler, effective alternative.

Method: Uses GNNs with raw current and vibration signals to automatically learn features and detect faults like eccentricity, bearing defects, and broken rotor bars.

Result: Achieves 92.5% accuracy for eccentricity, 91.2% for bearing faults, and 93.1% for broken rotor bars.

Conclusion: The GNN-based framework is robust, lightweight, and simplifies implementation, offering a viable alternative to conventional methods.

Abstract: The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based
methods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them
difficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these
limitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on
detecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and
broken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike
traditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct
inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature
extraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts
relevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture
complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated
for both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined
fault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, achieving 92.5\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\% for
bearing faults, and 93.1\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings
highlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different
operational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight
yet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high
diagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional
model-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring
and predictive maintenance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines reproducibility issues in ML applications for building energy systems, finding widespread lack of transparency and reproducibility, with most studies failing to disclose key details like dataset accessibility or code availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how reproducibility challenges manifest in applied ML disciplines, specifically in building energy systems, given the broader concerns about reproducibility in scientific research.

Method: Analyzes transparency and reproducibility standards in ML applications for building energy systems by reviewing key dimensions like dataset disclosure and code availability.

Result: Nearly all articles lacked reproducibility due to insufficient disclosure; 72% didn't specify dataset accessibility, and only two shared code (one broken). No significant difference was found between academic and industry-affiliated authors.

Conclusion: Targeted interventions—such as guidelines, researcher training, and journal/conference policies—are needed to improve transparency and reproducibility in ML applications.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent
verification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence
in fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -
replicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In
recent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part
of this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and
reliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other
fields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In
addition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism
and computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly
recognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about
how these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to
closing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of
ML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly
all articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key
dimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the
dataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers
share a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the
publications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no
significant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to
publications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the
need for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training
for researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote
transparency and reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing definitions and methods for hallucination in natural language processing do not extend to MVTS foundation models, necessitating new approaches.

Method: Proposes new definitions for MVTS hallucination and uses a diffusion model to estimate and mitigate hallucination levels, benchmarking on relational datasets.

Result: Pre-trained MVTS models hallucinate up to 59.5% as much as a baseline; mitigation reduces this by up to 47.7%.

Conclusion: The new definitions and methods can enhance the adoption and safe use of MVTS foundation models.

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent
definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation.
However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate
time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS
hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a
diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets
from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination
levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source
pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on
average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method
reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may
improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework for dynamic traffic flow forecasting, addressing global and local pattern encoding to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture global temporal-spatial patterns and overfit on pre-defined correlations, limiting robustness in complex traffic environments.

Method: Uses a graph transformer encoder for global patterns and graph convolution for local patterns, fused via a gated fusion unit with residual connections.

Result: Outperforms baselines on real-world traffic networks, demonstrating strong representation capability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances global and local temporal-spatial patterns, enhancing forecasting accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in
intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic
traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex
temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great
contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic
networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are
prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder
the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this
issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph
learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns
obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from
the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection
techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden
global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the
relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment
results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method
and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various
real-world traffic networks.

Motivation: Existing methods like robust or scenario-based optimization struggle with scalability for long optimization horizons in stochastic systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel relaxation framework (FRA) for graph matching, addressing errors in existing methods by reformulating the projection step with a Frobenius-regularized term. The SDSN algorithm and mixed-precision architecture enhance efficiency and accuracy, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing projection-based relaxations for graph matching introduce errors due to numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment. The goal is to mitigate these issues while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The authors reformulate the projection step as a Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, introducing a tunable regularization term. They propose the SDSN algorithm and a mixed-precision architecture for efficient solving.

Result: FRAM outperforms baseline methods in CPU benchmarks and achieves up to 370X speedup on GPU with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The FRA framework and SDSN algorithm effectively address errors in graph matching relaxations, offering a scalable and accurate solution with significant computational improvements.

Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the
NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations
that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,
these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources
of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the
relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel
relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a
Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable
regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation
enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance
without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling
Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable
computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision
architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based
benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods
under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based
mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its
CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

*Amir Hossein Kalantari,Eleonora Papadimitriou,Amir Pooyan Afghari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dynamic framework for identifying risky driving behavior using naturalistic driving data, leveraging rolling time windows and bi-level optimization. DNN excels in high-recall tasks, XGBoost offers balanced performance, and speed-weighted headway proves a stable risk indicator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for monitoring risky driving behavior rely on fixed time windows and static thresholds, limiting adaptability to real-world driving's stochastic nature.

Method: Proposes a dynamic, individualized framework using rolling time windows and bi-level optimization. Evaluates speed-weighted headway and harsh driving events with Random Forest, XGBoost, and DNN models.

Result: DNN excels in high-recall tasks, XGBoost provides balanced performance, and speed-weighted headway is a stable risk indicator.

Conclusion: Adaptive, personalized risk detection enhances real-time safety feedback and driver support in intelligent transport systems.

Abstract: Naturalistic driving studies offer a powerful means for observing and
quantifying real-world driving behaviour. One of their prominent applications
in traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky
driving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows
and static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -
limiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world
driving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for
identifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.
The approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to
dynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing
subtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and
harsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random
Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong
capability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly
excelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk
detection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across
different thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more
variability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which
may be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway
emerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh
driving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual
variation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised
risk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring
driver support in intelligent transport systems.

*Julien Simon de Kergunic,Rony Abecidan,Patrick Bas,Vincent Itier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning-based forensic tools for splicing detection are sensitive to training conditions and post-processing. Variability in latent spaces affects generalization. A strategy to improve robustness involves training multiple model variants and selecting the one with maximal latent margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning detectors for splicing are unreliable under post-processing, raising concerns about their practical deployment.

Method: Train multiple variants of the same model under different conditions and select the one with the largest latent margins to improve robustness.

Result: Latent margin distribution correlates with generalization to post-processed images.

Conclusion: Training model variants and selecting based on latent margins can enhance detector robustness against post-processing.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic
tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to
training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can
significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their
reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep
architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on
the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test
data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by
training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments
reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a
detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this
observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust
detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions,
and select the one that maximizes latent margins.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how transformers acquire and extract knowledge, introducing a one-layer framework with self-attention and MLPs to analyze training dynamics and prove convergence and generalization guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the theoretical opacity of how transformers store and retrieve knowledge, especially given prior limitations to simplified models and the empirical observation that such models may fail at factual knowledge tasks.

Method: Introduces a tractable one-layer transformer with self-attention and MLPs, analyzes gradient dynamics, and proves convergence and generalization guarantees. Experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets (PopQA) using GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B.

Result: Proves transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss (knowledge acquisition) and low generalization error under specific conditions (knowledge extraction). Otherwise, hallucinations occur. Validated empirically.

Conclusion: The framework provides theoretical insights into knowledge acquisition and extraction in transformers, explaining empirical phenomena like learning rate schedules and validating findings with experiments.

Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how
transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract
(retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque.
While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through
the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer,
attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs
are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based
language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such
simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction
objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer
framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By
tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization
guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.
We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during
pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large
fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers
can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned
during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating
successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,
transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our
analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore,
our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical
phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate
our results.

Method: Analyzed five GPT-2 models at three training checkpoints (100k, 200k, 300k steps) using pairwise correlation analysis of activations over 5M tokens. Conducted ablation experiments to measure functional impact.

Result: Universal neurons show high stability, especially in deeper layers, and significantly affect model predictions (loss and KL divergence).

Conclusion: Stable and universal representational structures emerge during training, highlighting the consistency of neural network learning.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained
GPT-2 Small models, examining how these universal neurons-neurons with
consistently correlated activations across models-emerge and evolve throughout
training. By analyzing five GPT-2 models at three checkpoints (100k, 200k, 300k

activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal
significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions,
measured via loss and KL divergence. Additionally, we quantify neuron
persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training
checkpoints, particularly in deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and
universal representational structures emerge during neural network training.

TL;DR: NeuCoReClass AD is a self-supervised multi-task framework for time series anomaly detection, combining contrastive, reconstruction, and classification tasks to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised methods for anomaly detection rely on single proxy tasks and domain-specific transformations, limiting their generalization.

Method: NeuCoReClass AD integrates contrastive, reconstruction, and classification tasks with neural transformation learning to generate diverse augmented views.

Result: The framework outperforms classical baselines and deep-learning alternatives across benchmarks and characterizes anomalies unsupervised.

Conclusion: NeuCoReClass AD addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a robust, generalizable solution for time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a critical role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised
learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of
labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task,
limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover,
they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains,
hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these
limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time
series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction,
and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation
learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and
coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass
AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently
outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives.
Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a
fully unsupervised manner.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PALACE is a user-side framework for auditing hidden token counts in LLM APIs, addressing token inflation concerns without internal access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial LLM services hide internal reasoning traces, leading to potential token inflation and overbilling, creating a need for reliable auditing.

Method: PALACE uses a GRPO-augmented adaptation module and lightweight domain router to estimate hidden token counts from prompt-answer pairs.

Result: Experiments show PALACE achieves low error and high accuracy across diverse reasoning tasks, enabling cost auditing and inflation detection.

Conclusion: PALACE advances predictive auditing, enhancing transparency and user trust in LLM services.

Abstract: Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still
charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden
intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential
overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing,
yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g.,
hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire
execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent
variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and
prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of
LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that
estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access
to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a
lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse
reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on
math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE
achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both
fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE
represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing,
offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user
trust.

### [107] [CaliMatch: Adaptive Calibration for Improving Safe Semi-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00922)
*Jinsoo Bae,Seoung Bum Kim,Hyungrok Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaliMatch improves semi-supervised learning (SSL) by calibrating classifier and OOD detector to address label distribution mismatch and overconfidence issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world SSL faces label distribution mismatch and overconfidence in deep neural networks, leading to errors.

Method: Proposes CaliMatch with adaptive label smoothing and temperature scaling for calibration.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet.

Conclusion: CaliMatch effectively addresses safe SSL challenges by improving calibration.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to improve the performance
of machine learning models when labeled data is scarce. However, its real-world
applications often face the label distribution mismatch problem, in which the
unlabeled dataset includes instances whose ground-truth labels are absent from
the labeled training dataset. Recent studies, referred to as safe SSL, have
addressed this issue by using both classification and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. However, the existing methods may suffer from overconfidence in deep
neural networks, leading to increased SSL errors because of high confidence in
incorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection. To address this, we propose a novel
method, CaliMatch, which calibrates both the classifier and the OOD detector to
foster safe SSL. CaliMatch presents adaptive label smoothing and temperature
scaling, which eliminates the need to manually tune the smoothing degree for
effective calibration. We give a theoretical justification for why improving
the calibration of both the classifier and the OOD detector is crucial in safe
SSL. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet demonstrate that CaliMatch outperforms the existing methods in safe
SSL tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dynamic, automatic, and systematic (DAS) red-teaming framework is proposed to continuously test LLMs in clinical settings, revealing vulnerabilities in robustness, privacy, bias/fairness, and hallucination that static benchmarks miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rapid advancement of LLMs and the inadequacy of static safety benchmarks in ensuring their reliability and safety in clinical practice.

Method: The DAS framework employs adversarial agents to autonomously mutate test cases, identify unsafe-triggering strategies, and evaluate responses in real time.

Result: Testing 15 LLMs showed high failure rates: 94% in robustness, 86% in privacy, 81% in bias/fairness, and 66% in hallucination, despite high static benchmark performance.

Conclusion: DAS red-teaming provides a scalable, evolvable safeguard for medical AI, essential for clinical applications, and outperforms static benchmarks in identifying risks.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in
clinical practice is critical to prevent patient harm and promote trustworthy
healthcare applications of AI. However, LLMs are advancing so rapidly that
static safety benchmarks often become obsolete upon publication, yielding only
an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture of model trustworthiness. We
demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming
framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses
of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy,
bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to
autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies,
and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human
intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a
stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under
adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of
previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed
similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited
in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations
in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\%
in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with
routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist
into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that
hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in
patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare
workflows. Our framework delivers an evolvable, scalable, and reliable
safeguard for the next generation of medical AI.

### [109] [Hybrid Hypergraph Networks for Multimodal Sequence Data Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00926)
*Feng Xu,Hui Wang,Yuting Huang,Danwei Zhang,Zizhu Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid hypergraph network (HHN) to model temporal multimodal data, addressing challenges in capturing long-range dependencies and cross-modal interactions. HHN achieves SOTA results on four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat modalities independently and use shallow fusion, missing temporal dependencies and complex structural relationships in multimodal data like audiovisual content.

Method: HHN uses a segmentation-first, graph-later strategy, splitting sequences into timestamped nodes. It captures intra-modal structures with hyperedges and hypergraph convolution, and inter-modal links via temporal alignment and graph attention.

Result: HHN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four multimodal datasets.

Conclusion: HHN effectively models temporal multimodal data, outperforming existing methods by capturing complex dependencies and interactions.

Abstract: Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in
classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a
representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order
and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is
essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal
correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality
independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal
dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural
relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph
network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a
segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped
segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured
via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node
heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution
to extract high-order dependencies. Inter-modal links are established through
temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. HHN achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four multimodal datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in complex classification tasks.

*M. Ontivero-Ortega,A. Fania,A. Lacalamita,R. Bellotti,A. Monaco,S. Stramaglia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive version of LOCO (Hi-Fi) for feature importance in XAI, quantifying unique, redundant, and synergistic effects. It compares Hi-Fi with Shapley effects and applies it to study air pollutants' impact on Alzheimer's disease mortality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature importance analysis in XAI by capturing high-order cooperative effects (synergy and redundancy) beyond traditional single-score methods.

Method: Proposes a framework assigning three scores (unique, redundant, synergistic) to data patterns, comparing with Shapley effects. Applied to air pollutants and Alzheimer's disease mortality.

Result: Identified synergistic associations between O3, NO2, and urban green areas with Alzheimer's mortality, notably in Bergamo and Brescia.

Conclusion: Hi-Fi is a promising tool for XAI and analyzing high-order relationships in complex systems.

Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in
systems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric
Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify
cooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order
effects involving a particular input feature in regression problems.
Differently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score
measures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by
three scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and
synergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores
(unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data
set, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named
{\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we
focus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and
Alzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic
association between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality,
especially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of
urban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the
prediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool
of wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to
analyze high-order relationships in complex systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes OKG-LLM, a framework integrating Ocean Knowledge Graph with LLMs for improved SST prediction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SST prediction methods lack domain knowledge integration, limiting accuracy. LLMs show potential but are underexplored for SST due to knowledge-data fusion challenges.

Method: Constructs an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG), uses graph embedding to learn semantic/structural knowledge, aligns it with SST data, and employs an LLM for prediction.

Result: OKG-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments, proving effective and robust.

Conclusion: OKG-LLM successfully integrates domain knowledge with numerical data, advancing SST prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is a critical task in ocean science,
supporting various applications, such as weather forecasting, fisheries
management, and storm tracking. While existing data-driven methods have
demonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich
domain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further
advancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language
models (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for
downstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains
underexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain
knowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge
Graph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To
the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to
construct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent
diverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding
network to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the
OKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and
the complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned
knowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM
to model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the
real-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and
potential to advance SST prediction. The codes are available in the online
repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature selection in machine learning by reducing features efficiently without compromising model accuracy.

Method: FeatureCuts adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff after filter ranking, evaluated on 15 datasets.

Result: Achieves 15% more feature reduction, 99.6% less computation time, and maintains performance. With PSO, it enables 25% more reduction and 66% less time.

Conclusion: FeatureCuts is scalable and efficient for large datasets, making it suitable for enterprise applications.

Abstract: In machine learning, the process of feature selection involves finding a
reduced subset of features that captures most of the information required to
train an accurate and efficient model. This work presents FeatureCuts, a novel
feature selection algorithm that adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff
after performing filter ranking. Evaluated on 14 publicly available datasets
and one industry dataset, FeatureCuts achieved, on average, 15 percentage
points more feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while
maintaining model performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
When the selected features are used in a wrapper method such as Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), it enables 25 percentage points more feature reduction,
requires 66% less computation time, and maintains model performance when
compared to PSO alone. The minimal overhead of FeatureCuts makes it scalable
for large datasets typically seen in enterprise applications.

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient framework for universal multimodal embeddings using hierarchical prompts and self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving state-of-the-art performance without contrastive pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses inefficiencies in adapting generative MLLMs for discriminative tasks, avoiding prohibitive computational costs and leveraging intrinsic capabilities.

Method: Uses a two-level hierarchical prompt template and self-aware hard negative sampling for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves competitive zero-shot performance and boosts fine-tuning by 4.8 points on MMEB, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: Offers an effective, efficient pathway for MLLM adaptation in embedding tasks, reducing training time.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution
for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for
discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The
dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical
inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to
leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To
overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal
multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic
components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a
two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce
discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second
component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process
by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging
negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our
comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot
performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the
fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8
points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our
self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance
without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and
efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly
reducing training time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of prior late-fusion methods (lack of unified frameworks, scalability issues, inflexible generalization) for personalized web services.

Method: Two-stage architecture: 1) Causal Q-Former projects domain-specific features into a shared space; 2) Multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes embeddings into compact tokens.

Result: Outperforms baselines in behavior prediction and recommendation tasks, with efficiency gains in storage and computation.

Conclusion: U^2QT enables seamless integration with language models and supports industrial-scale applications.

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling
personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have
adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they
suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks,
scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User
Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge
transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a
two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific
features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality
dependencies; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into
compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient
storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase
U^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific
baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while
achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization
framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports
industrial-scale applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework combining iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and active learning improves zero-shot text classification in dynamic domains with evolving knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot classification is challenging in domains like ticketing systems due to evolving knowledge and ambiguous categories. LLMs struggle with topic separability, and few-shot methods lack data diversity.

Method: The framework uses iterative contrastive prompting and human-in-the-loop refinement to clarify category distinctions, enabling integration of new classes without retraining.

Result: Achieves 91% accuracy on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with minimal accuracy drop for unseen classes.

Conclusion: Prompt-based semantic reasoning is effective for fine-grained classification with limited supervision, suitable for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with
evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing
systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these
scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are
constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification
framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and
active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model
generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then
used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category
distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely
related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing
users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This
enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining,
making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The
evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy
on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with
minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%,
respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic
reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Enhanced PGNNIV framework improves scalability for high-dimensional data using reduced-order modeling, transfer learning, and surrogate decoders, maintaining accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability limitations of PGNNIV in high-dimensional data like spatial fields or time-evolving systems.

Method: Introduce surrogate decoders (spectral decomposition, POD, pretrained autoencoders) and integrate transfer learning for model reuse.

Result: Successfully identifies constitutive state equations, improves noise robustness, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands.

Conclusion: Enhanced PGNNIV framework overcomes scalability challenges, adaptable to various scenarios with high predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools
that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel
internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by
prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing
certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables.
Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when
applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or
time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV
framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order
modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original
decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained
autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs
between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and
generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we
integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to
exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel
materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while
maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various
techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion
equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced
PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state
equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves
robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands.
The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data
availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming
scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy inefficiency in large-scale machine learning workloads, particularly in tensor parallelism, drives the need for sustainable alternatives.

Method: Develops new forward and backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implements them in an autograd pipeline, and compares performance and energy efficiency against tensor parallelism.

Result: Empirical results on up to 256 GPUs show ~50% energy reduction and comparable model performance with smaller GPU counts.

Conclusion: Phantom parallelism offers significant energy savings and scalability, making it a promising approach for sustainable large-scale ML training.

Abstract: Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network
models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale
machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy,
called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of
traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component
of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of
feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive,
proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and
backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as
custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training
pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against
those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that
predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical
results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown
to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the
proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor
parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller
phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor
parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater
energy savings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FinKario, a dataset and retrieval method, to enhance financial analysis by addressing slow updates and unstructured data in equity reports, improving stock trend prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individual investors struggle with information overload and lack of professional analysis. Equity research reports are valuable but hindered by slow updates and unstructured formats, limiting LLMs' effectiveness.

Method: Developed FinKario, a dataset with structured financial insights, and FinKario-RAG, a two-stage retrieval method, to integrate real-time data and optimize knowledge access for LLMs.

Result: FinKario with FinKario-RAG outperformed financial LLMs by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% in stock trend prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively addresses the challenges of slow updates and unstructured data, enhancing financial analysis and decision-making for investors.

Abstract: Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in
financial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional
analysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering
valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs)
can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial
analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid
evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing
knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports
further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these
challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce
the Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph
(FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational
triples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates
real-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven
extraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured
and accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a
Two-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the
retrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and
precise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG
achieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs
by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.

*Timothy Oladunni,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study challenges the assumption that adding more modalities always improves performance in multimodal deep learning for biomedical signal classification, showing that optimal fusion depends on complementarity, not quantity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze how complementary feature domains impact model performance in multimodal deep learning for biomedical signal classification, moving beyond heuristic feature selection.

Method: Five deep learning models were designed (three unimodal and two multimodal) and rigorously evaluated for ECG classification using bootstrapping and Bayesian inference.

Result: Hybrid 1 (fusing time and time-frequency domains) outperformed baselines, while Hybrid 2 (adding frequency domain) showed no improvement, indicating redundancy.

Conclusion: Optimal multimodal performance depends on intrinsic complementarity of domains, not the number of modalities, leading to a new quantifiable framework for domain fusion.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for
biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary
feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often
presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can
yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To
validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and
rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for
time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal
(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,
2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian
inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline
across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming
the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.
Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further
improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational
redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.
This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in
biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't
about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent
complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic
feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature
Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically
quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating
that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic
information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.

stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. First, we
perform balanced few-shot retrieval by embedding premises with both semantic
(BGE) and lexical (BM25) similarity. Next, we assemble these contexts into LLM
prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM
ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are
injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively
fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT
elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from
75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%.
It also consistently outperforms prior in-context adversarial methods by up to
2.0% across datasets. By automating high-quality adversarial data curation at
scale, VAULT enables rapid, human-independent robustness improvements in NLI
inference tasks.

### [121] [Masked Omics Modeling for Multimodal Representation Learning across Histopathology and Molecular Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00969)
*Lucas Robinet,Ahmad Berjaoui,Elizabeth Cohen-Jonathan Moyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MORPHEUS is a transformer-based framework integrating histopathology and multi-omics data for improved cancer analysis, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Histopathology alone lacks molecular insights; integrating multi-omics data can enhance understanding of clinical outcomes.

Method: Uses masked modeling to learn cross-modal relationships, enabling flexible input combinations and any-to-any omics generation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods across tasks and modality combinations.

Conclusion: MORPHEUS is a promising multimodal foundation model for oncology.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology
by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short
for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as
important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like
transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS,
a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both
histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core,
MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected
omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful
cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to
histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities,
seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables
any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred
from any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large
pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a
promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

### [122] [Optimal Scheduling Algorithms for LLM Inference: Theory and Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01002)
*Agrim Bari,Parikshit Hegde,Gustavo de Veciana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for efficient LLM inference systems by proposing a theoretical framework and two schedulers (RAD and SLAI) to optimize throughput and meet practical SLOs like TBT and TTFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of LLM-based tools necessitates efficient inference systems due to their unique two-phase computation structure (prefill and decode phases).

Method: Developed a theoretical framework for routing and scheduling, introducing the RAD scheduler for throughput optimality and the SLAI scheduler for practical SLOs like TBT and TTFT.

Result: SLAI reduced median TTFT by 53% and increased serving capacity by 26% while meeting tail TBT constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed schedulers (RAD and SLAI) effectively optimize LLM inference systems, improving throughput and meeting practical SLOs.

Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient
LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase
computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and
a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This
structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by
developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM
inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and
dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.
Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)
scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild
conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as
serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design
the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements
to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and
reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the
Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.
  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model
on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the
median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that
median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.

*Gnankan Landry Regis N'guessan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: v-PuNNs introduce p-adic neural networks for hierarchical data, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with interpretable, ultrametric representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean space is unsuitable for hierarchical data like taxa or word senses, necessitating a model that aligns with hierarchical structures.

Method: v-PuNNs use p-adic balls and TURL for subtree semantics, with VAPO optimization for training.

Result: Achieves 99.96% leaf accuracy on WordNet, 96.9% on GO, and Spearman ρ = -0.96 on NCBI Mammalia.

Conclusion: v-PuNNs bridge number theory and deep learning, providing exact, interpretable models for hierarchical data.

Abstract: Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word
senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs),
the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic
balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation
Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact
subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a
depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents
any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose
Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic
variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three
canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art:
WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO
molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho
= -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly
ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and
information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive
structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative
codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and
deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for
hierarchical data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a proximity-based acquisition strategy for multi-fidelity optimization using Gaussian Processes (GPs), simplifying fidelity selection and enabling multi-fidelity UCB strategies. It benchmarks these methods against others, showing consistent control over high-fidelity usage and efficient convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-fidelity optimization by reducing reliance on expensive high-fidelity evaluations and simplifying fidelity selection.

Method: Proximity-based acquisition strategy integrated with multi-fidelity GPs, compared with other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies.

Result: Proximity-based strategy effectively controls high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances GP-based multi-fidelity optimization, offering practical benefits in tasks like chemical kinetic modeling.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity optimization employs surrogate models that integrate
information from varying levels of fidelity to guide efficient exploration of
complex design spaces while minimizing the reliance on (expensive)
high-fidelity objective function evaluations. To advance Gaussian Process
(GP)-based multi-fidelity optimization, we implement a proximity-based
acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need
for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable
multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with
multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark
these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies
(including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance
on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative
optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based
multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over
high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative
examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and
heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).

*Jesse He,Akbar Rafiey,Gal Mishne,Yusu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes GNN explanation methods, comparing perturbation-based and gradient-based approaches, and establishes theoretical connections between them. It also provides practical insights through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a deeper theoretical understanding of GNN explanation methods due to inconsistent results and challenges with complex architectures.

Method: The study examines input-level and layerwise explanations, comparing perturbation-based and gradient-based methods, and derives theoretical connections.

Result: Conditions are identified where GNNExplainer can be approximated by edge gradient signs, and edge gradients are shown equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs.

Conclusion: The paper bridges theoretical gaps in GNN explainability and validates findings with experiments, offering practical guidance for method selection.

Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on
graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN
predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in
flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many
explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This
presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing
GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations
in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory
subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce
explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first
theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical
gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently
proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which
GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the
edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are
equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our
theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error in MARL by adaptive action sampling, improving policy gradient reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Independent policy gradients in MARL can lead to suboptimal convergence due to sampling error, even when gradients point to optimal solutions.

Method: Introduces MA-PROPS, an adaptive action sampling method using a centralized behavior policy to reduce joint sampling error.

Result: MA-PROPS reduces sampling error more efficiently than standard methods and improves convergence to optimal joint policies.

Conclusion: Coordinated action selection via MA-PROPS enhances the reliability of policy gradient learning in MARL.

Abstract: Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games,
but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient
points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler
failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all
agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of
trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint
data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution.
This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces
inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In
this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through
coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of
policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive
action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method,
Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized
behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint
actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We
empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and
demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently
than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of
independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training
runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.

*Xuan Liu,Siru Ouyang,Xianrui Zhong,Jiawei Han,Huimin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FGBench introduces a dataset with 625K molecular property reasoning problems, incorporating fine-grained functional group (FG) information to enhance LLMs' interpretability and reasoning in chemistry. Current LLMs struggle with FG-level tasks, highlighting the need for improved capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets focus on molecular-level property prediction but lack fine-grained FG information, which is crucial for linking molecular structures with textual descriptions and advancing molecular design.

Method: FGBench provides a dataset with precisely annotated FG information, covering 245 functional groups across three categories: single FG impacts, multiple FG interactions, and direct molecular comparisons.

Result: Benchmarking shows current LLMs struggle with FG-level reasoning, indicating a gap in their capabilities for chemistry tasks.

Conclusion: FGBench's methodology offers a framework for generating FG-level datasets, aiding LLMs in understanding molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry.
However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction
and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information.
Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links
molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more
interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks.
Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden
relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties,
thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce
FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with
functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and
localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability
thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both
regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across
three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group
impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular
comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the
results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,
highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry
tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct
datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational
framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better
understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset
and evaluation code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a geometric and algorithmic understanding of data-driven quantization in neural networks by linking it to lattice problems.

Method: The paper demonstrates the equivalence between the GPTQ algorithm and Babai's nearest-plane algorithm, using geometric intuition to explain both.

Result: The GPTQ algorithm is proven equivalent to Babai's nearest-plane algorithm, and lattice basis reduction is proposed for better quantization.

Conclusion: The findings suggest potential improvements in quantization methods through lattice basis reduction, offering a new perspective on neural network optimization.

Abstract: We explain how data-driven quantization of a linear unit in a neural network
corresponds to solving the closest vector problem for a certain lattice
generated by input data. We prove that the GPTQ algorithm is equivalent to
Babai's well-known nearest-plane algorithm. We furthermore provide geometric
intuition for both algorithms. Lastly, we note the consequences of these
results, in particular hinting at the possibility for using lattice basis
reduction for better quantization.

*Siddharth Rout,Eldad Haber,Stephane Gaudreault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flow matching variant for probabilistic forecasting in dynamical systems, addressing challenges like missing variables and noise. It proposes a generative ML approach for perturbations and validates the method on high-dimensional datasets like WeatherBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models struggle with ill-posed dynamical systems due to missing variables and noise. Stochastic ML techniques offer solutions by enabling probabilistic forecasting.

Method: A flow matching variant for probabilistic forecasting, using generative ML to perturb states logically and physically, beyond Gaussian assumptions.

Result: The method effectively models uncertainty in high-dimensional dynamical systems, validated on datasets like WeatherBench.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances probabilistic forecasting for dynamical systems, handling complex perturbations and high-dimensional data.

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying
machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and
noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due
to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning
techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed
problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may
yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such
scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,
we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which
estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes
rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states
is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to
crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a
Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to
physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional
dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our
method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical
systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset,
which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.

TL;DR: A machine learning framework for classifying student stress achieves high accuracy (93.09%-99.53%) using ensemble methods, outperforming traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of traditional subjective surveys for timely student stress intervention.

Method: A six-stage pipeline with preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and six base classifiers, enhanced by ensemble strategies.

Result: Best models achieve 93.09% (weighted hard voting) and 99.53% (stacking) accuracy on two datasets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for early stress detection in academic settings, supporting student well-being.

Abstract: Student mental health is an increasing concern in academic institutions,
where stress can severely impact well-being and academic performance.
Traditional assessment methods rely on subjective surveys and periodic
evaluations, offering limited value for timely intervention. This paper
introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student
stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological,
academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage
pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV),
dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance
performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft
voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy
with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with
stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of context-integrated, data-driven
systems for early stress detection and underscore their applicability in
real-world academic settings to support student well-being.

TL;DR: BUS is a tree-based method for user segmentation in recommendation systems, improving cold-start and fairness by integrating behavioral and social graph data, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the cold-start problem and enhancing recommendations for new or infrequent users by leveraging user attributes and behaviors.

Method: Hierarchical segmentation using NDCG for behavioral representativeness, further refined with social graph data for fairness.

Result: Offline analysis shows superior ranking quality; online deployment improved metrics like music ranking and email notifications.

Conclusion: BUS is an effective, scalable framework for integrating diverse user attributes while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: User attributes are essential in multiple stages of modern recommendation
systems and are particularly important for mitigating the cold-start problem
and improving the experience of new or infrequent users. We propose
Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that
hierarchically segments the user universe with various users' categorical
attributes based on the users' product-specific engagement behaviors. During
the BUS tree construction, we use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
as the objective function to maximize the behavioral representativeness of
marginal users relative to active users in the same segment. The constructed
BUS tree undergoes further processing and aggregation across the leaf nodes and
internal nodes, allowing the generation of popular social content and
behavioral patterns for each node in the tree. To further mitigate bias and
improve fairness, we use the social graph to derive the user's connection-based
BUS segments, enabling the combination of behavioral patterns extracted from
both the user's own segment and connection-based segments as the connection
aware BUS-based recommendation. Our offline analysis shows that the BUS-based
retrieval significantly outperforms traditional user cohort-based aggregation
on ranking quality. We have successfully deployed our data structure and
machine learning algorithm and tested it with various production traffic
serving billions of users daily, achieving statistically significant
improvements in the online product metrics, including music ranking and email
notifications. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first
list-wise learning-to-rank framework for tree-based recommendation that
effectively integrates diverse user categorical attributes while preserving
real-world semantic interpretability at a large industrial scale.

TL;DR: Exploring Transformer-based PRNGs for generating high-quality pseudo-random numbers, validated by theoretical proofs and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRNGs are crucial for optimizing large language models, and Transformers' ability to handle nonlinear relationships makes them suitable for PRNG tasks.

Method: Theoretical demonstration of decoder-only Transformers with Chain-of-Thought simulating LCG and MT PRNGs, followed by experimental validation.

Result: Transformer-based PRNGs pass NIST tests and exhibit statistical randomness, with heat maps confirming quality.

Conclusion: Transformers can effectively simulate PRNGs, offering potential benefits for applications requiring high-quality randomness.

Abstract: Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are high-nonlinear processes, and
they are key blocks in optimization of Large language models. Transformers
excel at processing complex nonlinear relationships. Thus it is reasonable to
generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers based on transformers. In this
paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical
perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of
Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only
Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear
Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we
conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent
non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated
through experiments. The random numbers generated by Transformer-based PRNGs
successfully pass the majority of NIST tests, whose heat maps exhibit clear
statistical randomness. Finally, we assess their capability in prediction
attacks.

TL;DR: The paper investigates vulnerabilities in model-merging methods, identifies harmful factors (task vector norm disparities and low source-model confidence), and proposes DisTaC to pre-condition task vectors for better merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robustness in model-merging methods in realistic settings by identifying and mitigating harmful source-model characteristics.

Method: Proposes DisTaC, a method using knowledge distillation to adjust task vector norms and boost source-model confidence before merging.

Result: DisTaC enables successful merging of models with harmful traits, achieving significant performance gains.

Conclusion: DisTaC improves the robustness and effectiveness of model-merging techniques by addressing critical vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for
multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years.
However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark
suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more
realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first
investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the
source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we
identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1)
disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source
models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector
Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task
vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a
task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its
essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging
techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits --
where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.

*Hongquan Zhang,Jingyu Gong,Zhizhong Zhang,Xin Tan,Yanyun Qu,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2S is a unified framework for lifelong imitation learning that balances mitigating catastrophic forgetting and acquiring new skills by tokenizing model parameters and using cross-attention. It achieves strong performance in preventing forgetting, scaling new skills, and enabling knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is balancing catastrophic forgetting and new skill acquisition in lifelong imitation learning, which current approaches address in isolation.

Method: T2S tokenizes model parameters, transforming linear mappings into cross-attention for scalability. It also uses language-guided skill scaling for efficient knowledge transfer.

Result: T2S prevents catastrophic forgetting (1.0% NBT), scales new skills with minimal parameter growth (8.0% trainable tokens), and enables efficient knowledge transfer (77.7% FWT).

Conclusion: T2S offers a promising solution for lifelong imitation learning by unifying skill retention and acquisition.

Abstract: The main challenge in lifelong imitation learning lies in the balance between
mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previous skills while maintaining
sufficient capacity for acquiring new ones. However, current approaches
typically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal
correlation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a
unified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by
tokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the
traditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and
learnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy
extension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill
scaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly
growing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that
T2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT
of 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling
with minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable
tokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge
transfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three
LIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation
learning.

Motivation: Current training optimizes risk-neutral objectives, but evaluation uses risk-seeking metrics, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes Risk-Seeking Policy Optimization (RSPO), which targets Pass@k and Max@k, addressing the 'hitchhiking' problem with efficient gradient estimators.

Result: RSPO provides efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for risk-seeking metrics, validated by theory and experiments.

Conclusion: RSPO bridges the gap between training and evaluation, improving performance for risk-seeking metrics.

Abstract: Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective
that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking
metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum
reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably
lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking
Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and
Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the
"hitchhiking" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if
they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,
resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by
leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum
among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple
responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both
metrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and
comprehensive experimental results.

*Shiko Kudo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a sine-wave based activation function, offering higher expressive power and parameter efficiency than traditional activations like ReLU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural networks rely on simple, monotonically-increasing activations (e.g., ReLU), requiring large models for complex tasks. PLU aims to improve efficiency and expressive power.

Method: PLU is a learnable sine-wave activation with periodic non-monotonicity, enhanced by Repulsive Reparameterization to prevent collapse into linearity.

Result: A minimal MLP with two PLU neurons solves the spiral classification task, impossible for standard activations, demonstrating exponential parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: PLU suggests a shift from piecewise Taylor-like approximators to Fourier-like synthesizers, embedding intelligence in neurons for efficiency.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple,
monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this
paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate
complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU),
a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is
designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through
its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization,
which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear
function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve
the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using
standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise
Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers,
achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in
the neuron itself.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational platforms for drug discovery are fragmented, inefficient, and lack generalization to OOD data, hindering progress. BSL aims to address these limitations.

Method: BSL combines generative models and graph neural networks in a unified framework, focusing on generalization to OOD molecular structures.

Result: BSL achieves SOTA performance on benchmarks and identifies three bioactive compounds for the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor.

Conclusion: BSL is a scalable, effective, and innovative platform for accelerating drug discovery and biomedical research.

Abstract: Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health,
prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent
years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key
tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data
processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing
computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to
fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack
algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address
these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced,
open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven
core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced
technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition
to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark
datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on
generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with
existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a
comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery,
offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for
real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical
utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor,
successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro
electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and
comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery.

*Sukwon Yun,Xin Liu,Yunhak Oh,Junseok Lee,Tianlong Chen,Tsuyoshi Murata,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GOODIE is a hybrid framework combining Label Propagation and Feature Propagation to handle missing node features in graphs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the sub-optimal performance of GNNs in graphs with missing features, especially when few features are available.

Method: Proposes GOODIE, a hybrid approach using Label Propagation and Feature Propagation branches, with a GNN-based decoder and Structure-Feature Attention. Introduces Pseudo-Label contrastive learning for final predictions.

Result: GOODIE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scenarios with few or abundant features.

Conclusion: GOODIE effectively leverages structure and feature information, providing superior performance in node classification tasks with missing features.

Abstract: In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a
few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed.
In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield
sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite
the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing
situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse
than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel
framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation
(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a
partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach
to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation
branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label
Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP
branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and
feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.
Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the
contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP
branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few
features are available but also in abundantly available situations. Source code
of GOODIE is available at: https://github.com/SukwonYun/GOODIE.

### [140] [Multi-Operator Few-Shot Learning for Generalization Across PDE Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01211)
*Yile Li,Shandian Zhe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOFS is a multimodal framework for few-shot learning of PDE operators, combining self-supervised pretraining, text-conditioned embeddings, and memory-augmented prompting to generalize across PDE families with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operator methods lack generalization across PDE families and require abundant training data for each PDE. MOFS aims to address these limitations by enabling few-shot learning for unseen PDE operators.

Method: MOFS integrates multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared FNO encoder, text-conditioned operator embeddings, and memory-augmented multimodal prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal attention. It uses a two-stage training paradigm for prompt-conditioned inference and contrastive fine-tuning.

Result: MOFS outperforms existing baselines in few-shot generalization on PDE benchmarks like Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants. Ablations confirm the contributions of each modality and training component.

Conclusion: MOFS provides a universal and data-efficient foundation for learning PDE operators across scientific domains, advancing the field of scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Learning solution operators for partial differential equations (PDEs) has
become a foundational task in scientific machine learning. However, existing
neural operator methods require abundant training data for each specific PDE
and lack the ability to generalize across PDE families. In this work, we
propose MOFS: a unified multimodal framework for multi-operator few-shot
learning, which aims to generalize to unseen PDE operators using only a few
demonstration examples. Our method integrates three key components: (i)
multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) encoder to reconstruct masked spatial fields and predict frequency
spectra, (ii) text-conditioned operator embeddings derived from statistical
summaries of input-output fields, and (iii) memory-augmented multimodal
prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal gradient-based attention. We adopt
a two-stage training paradigm that first learns prompt-conditioned inference on
seen operators and then applies end-to-end contrastive fine-tuning to align
latent representations across vision, frequency, and text modalities.
Experiments on PDE benchmarks, including Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants,
demonstrate that our model outperforms existing operator learning baselines in
few-shot generalization. Extensive ablations validate the contributions of each
modality and training component. Our approach offers a new foundation for
universal and data-efficient operator learning across scientific domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel spatial interpolation pipeline using GNNs and PNA-GPE integration improves reliability and visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data, including uncertainty encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional interpolation methods are unreliable due to limited sensor coverage, necessitating better techniques for accurate visualization.

Method: Leverages GNNs for imputation, integrates PNA and GPE for spatiotemporal learning, and introduces static visualization for uncertainty.

Result: Superior performance in data imputation, improved interpolant reliability, and effective uncertainty communication.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enhances spatiotemporal data visualization and decision-making with reliable interpolation and clear uncertainty representation.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as
environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed
decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall
short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and
irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation
pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel
heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage
imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance
visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal
Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our
model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based
heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various
sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our
model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the
interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization
design in communicating uncertainties.

### [142] [Soft Separation and Distillation: Toward Global Uniformity in Federated Unsupervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01251)
*Hung-Chieh Fang,Hsuan-Tien Lin,Irwin King,Yifei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Soft Separation and Distillation (SSD) to improve global uniformity in Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) by addressing inter-client uniformity issues caused by non-IID data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FUL methods achieve local uniformity but struggle with global uniformity due to decentralized data and non-IID distributions.

Method: SSD encourages client representations to spread in different directions, reducing aggregation interference, and includes a projector distillation module to align loss optimization with representation quality.

Result: SSD improves representation quality and task performance in cross-silo and cross-device federated settings.

Conclusion: Inter-client uniformity is crucial in FUL, and SSD effectively addresses this challenge.

Abstract: Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) aims to learn expressive
representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of
representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure
of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space.
However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local)
uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global)
uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the
decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation
and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity
by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions.
This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby
improving global uniformity while preserving local representation
expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector
distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and
representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device
federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation
quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results
highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as
an effective solution to this challenge. Project page:

### [143] [Exploitation Is All You Need... for Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01287)
*Micah Rentschler,Jesse Roberts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Greedy-trained meta-RL agents can exhibit exploratory behavior if environmental structure, agent memory, and long-horizon credit assignment are present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the need for explicit exploration incentives by showing that exploration can emerge naturally under specific conditions.

Method: Train agents on a greedy objective in environments with recurring structure, agent memory, and long-horizon credit assignment. Test in stochastic bandits and gridworlds.

Result: Agents showed exploratory behavior when all conditions were met, but not when structure or memory was missing. Long-horizon credit assignment was less critical.

Conclusion: Exploration can emerge from exploitation under the right conditions, suggesting a unified approach to reward maximization.

Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments.
Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit
incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained
solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless
exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1)
Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable
regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent
Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data;
and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over
a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform
current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and
temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory
are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits
information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through
controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either
environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).
Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not
always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the
pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right
prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal
objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedCD, a fairness-aware federated cognitive diagnosis framework, to address privacy and fairness challenges in online education by decoupling model parameters into personalized and shared components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The influx of distributed student learning data in online education platforms raises privacy and fairness concerns, especially due to data quality disparities between groups/schools.

Method: FedCD uses federated learning with a parameter decoupling strategy: locally personalized parameters for fair diagnosis and globally shared parameters updated via fairness-aware aggregation.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets show FedCD outperforms five FL approaches under three CD models in achieving precise and fair diagnosis.

Conclusion: FedCD effectively balances privacy preservation and fairness in cognitive diagnosis, demonstrating superior performance over existing FL methods.

Abstract: Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of
distributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities
for cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts
while also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope
with this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by
jointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their
original data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability
differences and educational context differences between different
groups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of
models. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware
federated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models
built upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,
preserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students
on each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the
students in each client based on its local student learning data, and each
client uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter
aggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The
main idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the
first is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic
function-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;
the second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,
containing exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware
aggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD
framework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under
three CD models.

*Joshua Dimasaka,Christian Geiß,Emily So*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphVSSM, a probabilistic spatiotemporal framework using machine learning to dynamically assess physical vulnerability in disaster resilience, validated through case studies and an open dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing physical vulnerability in disaster resilience are static and limited. The authors aim to leverage time-series satellite data and machine learning to improve this.

Method: GraphVSSM integrates graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference to analyze spatial-temporal data and expert beliefs in a weakly supervised manner.

Result: Case studies in Quezon City, Khurushkul, and Freetown demonstrate the method's effectiveness. An open dataset, METEOR 2.5D, is also introduced.

Conclusion: GraphVSSM advances disaster resilience assessment and offers a probabilistic deep learning approach for urban studies with weak supervision.

Abstract: Regional disaster resilience quantifies the changing nature of physical risks
to inform policy instruments ranging from local immediate recovery to
international sustainable development. While many existing state-of-practice
methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our
understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static,
costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and
inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of
time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we
focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk
equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that
flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal
observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal
inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model
(GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates
graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using
time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or
coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide
demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes
in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and
mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset,
METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset
for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster
resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk
reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning
approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data
analysis in weak supervision.

*Vamsi Sai Krishna Malineni,Suresh Rajendran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs address the challenge of sparse data in engineering by embedding physical principles, focusing on flow reconstruction from sparse datasets in 2D and 3D flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the high cost of large datasets in engineering by leveraging physics-informed approaches for flow reconstruction.

Method: Develop PINN models for 2D laminar and 3D turbulent flows, comparing training methods (Standard PINN, BC-PINN) and optimizing physics constraints and loss functions.

Result: PINNs effectively reconstruct flow fields from sparse data, demonstrating adaptability to complex scenarios like turbulent flows.

Conclusion: PINNs show promise for real-world engineering applications with limited data, offering accurate flow reconstruction and physics learning.

Abstract: The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and
engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn
intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models
in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such
datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive.
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine
Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within
neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving
diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is
limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data
under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on
forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop
models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets
mirroring real-world scenarios.
  This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar
flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent
flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the
effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible
PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic
relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function
components. The second case highlights the capability of PINN-based models to
learn underlying physics from sparse data while accurately reconstructing the
flow field for a highly turbulent flow.

*Christopher Godwin Udomboso,Caston Sigauke,Ini Adinya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fusion Sampling Validation (FSV), a hybrid model combining Simple Random Sampling (SRS) and K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV) to improve data partitioning in machine learning. FSV outperforms both SRS and KFCV in accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like KFCV and SRS have limitations in computational efficiency and representativeness, especially with imbalanced data. FSV aims to address these issues by merging their strengths.

Method: FSV integrates SRS and KFCV, using weighted factors and scaling to enhance performance. It was tested on datasets of 10K, 50K, and 100K samples with metrics like ME, VE, MSE, bias, and convergence rates.

Result: FSV showed superior performance with ME of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, and low bias (0.016288). It also demonstrated faster convergence rates compared to SRS and KFCV.

Conclusion: FSV provides a practical, efficient solution for data partitioning, especially in resource-constrained or large-scale scenarios, improving machine learning model robustness and generalisation.

Abstract: Effective data partitioning is known to be crucial in machine learning.
Traditional cross-validation methods like K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV)
enhance model robustness but often compromise generalisation assessment due to
high computational demands and extensive data shuffling. To address these
issues, the integration of the Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which, despite
providing representative samples, can result in non-representative sets with
imbalanced data. The study introduces a hybrid model, Fusion Sampling
Validation (FSV), combining SRS and KFCV to optimise data partitioning. FSV
aims to minimise biases and merge the simplicity of SRS with the accuracy of
KFCV. The study used three datasets of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 samples,
generated with a normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) and initialised with
seed 42. KFCV was performed with five folds and ten repetitions, incorporating
a scaling factor to ensure robust performance estimation and generalisation
capability. FSV integrated a weighted factor to enhance performance and
generalisation further. Evaluations focused on mean estimates (ME), variance
estimates (VE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, the rate of convergence for
mean estimates (ROC\_ME), and the rate of convergence for variance estimates
(ROC\_VE). Results indicated that FSV consistently outperformed SRS and KFCV,
with ME values of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, bias of 0.016288,
ROC\_ME of 0.005199, and ROC\_VE of 0.007137. FSV demonstrated superior
accuracy and reliability in data partitioning, particularly in
resource-constrained environments and extensive datasets, providing practical
solutions for effective machine learning implementations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A practical sub-optimality estimator is proposed to assess optimization limitations in deep RL, revealing that current methods exploit only half of the good experience they generate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL policies often underperform due to optimization difficulties, raising concerns about the effectiveness of improved exploration or reward objectives.

Method: Introduces a sub-optimality estimator to evaluate optimization gaps in deep RL, tested across environments and algorithms.

Result: Experiments show the best experience is 2-3x better than learned policies, indicating significant underutilization of generated experience.

Conclusion: Deep RL methods exploit only half of their good experience, highlighting a need for better optimization techniques.

Abstract: In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex,
as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future
exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning
policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal
performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if
the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives,
will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization
difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality
estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is
shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$
better than the policies' learned performance. This large difference indicates
that deep RL methods only exploit half of the good experience they generate.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes LoRA-based Federated Learning (FL), categorizing aggregation methods into Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS), and provides a unified convergence analysis with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing size of ML models in FL creates communication and computation challenges. LoRA reduces overhead, but effective aggregation of LoRA-updated models is understudied.

Method: The paper defines the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO), derives a general convergence condition, and presents sufficient conditions for global model convergence.

Result: SP and PS aggregation methods satisfy convergence conditions but differ in achieving optimal rates. Experiments validate the findings.

Conclusion: The study offers a principled understanding of LoRA-based FL aggregation, with theoretical and empirical support for SP and PS methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing
size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation
challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into
FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by
updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its
effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains
a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified
convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current
aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS).
Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a
general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present
several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model.
These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various
aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation
methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to
achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

### [150] [Quenched large deviations for Monte Carlo integration with Coulomb gases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01392)
*Rémi Bardenet,Mylène Maïda,Martin Rouault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Gibbs measures for randomized numerical integration, addressing challenges in tuning interaction kernels and confining potentials to match the target distribution. It leverages large deviations theory to show that random approximations of the potential maintain performance guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve numerical integration by exploiting repulsiveness in Gibbs measures, while overcoming the challenge of tuning the system to align with the target distribution.

Method: Uses large deviations theory (Garcia--Zelada, 2019) to analyze random approximations of the potential, ensuring performance guarantees for integration algorithms. For non-singular kernels, minimal assumptions are made; for Coulomb kernels, Gibbs-based approximations are required.

Result: Random approximations of the potential preserve the fast large deviation principle, ensuring the integration algorithm outperforms independent or Markov quadratures. Uniform convergence of the potential approximation is proven for Coulomb kernels.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient numerical integration by leveraging Gibbs measures, with theoretical guarantees for performance even when using random approximations of the potential.

Abstract: Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of
interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as
randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure
$\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between
particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach
is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure,
so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$.
Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the
\emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to
$\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we
show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large
deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to
outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction
kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be
the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the
Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another
Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of
the approximation of the potential.

*Stefan Bielmeier,Gerald Friedland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how feature correlations affect Dense Associative Memory (DAM) capacity, showing exponential scaling with pattern separation and slight capacity reduction due to correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current capacity analyses ignore feature-correlated data, which is common in practical machine learning.

Method: An empirical framework using Hamming distance and binary search to measure capacity under varying feature correlations.

Result: Capacity scales exponentially with separation; correlations slightly reduce it, especially at higher polynomial degrees.

Conclusion: The study links theory and practice for DAM, suggesting data-centric improvements.

Abstract: We investigate how feature correlations influence the capacity of Dense
Associative Memory (DAM), a Transformer attention-like model. Practical machine
learning scenarios involve feature-correlated data and learn representations in
the input space, but current capacity analyses do not account for this. We
develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on
capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary
in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from
information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity
using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory
capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space.
Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce
capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher
polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory
is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than
patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM,
and might inspire more data-centric methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CPformer is a Transformer model enhanced with concepts and physics for accurate, explainable forecasting, outperforming baselines on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate, explainable, and physically-credible forecasting for multivariate time-series with varying statistical properties across domains.

Method: CPformer integrates self-supervised, domain-agnostic concepts and enforces differentiable residuals from first-principle constraints, combining latent transparency with scientific guidance.

Result: Achieves lowest error in 8 of 12 MSE/MAE cells, reducing MSE by 23% on Electricity, 44% on Traffic, and 61% on Illness compared to FEDformer.

Conclusion: CPformer effectively combines explainability and physical credibility with strong performance, especially on non-periodic datasets.

Abstract: Accurate, explainable and physically-credible forecasting remains a
persistent challenge for multivariate time-series whose statistical properties
vary across domains. We present CPformer, a Concept- and Physics-enhanced
Transformer that channels every prediction through five self-supervised,
domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals drawn from
first-principle constraints. Unlike prior efficiency-oriented Transformers that
rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent
transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long
contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly
Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly
Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves
the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest
Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on
Electricity, 44% on Traffic and 61% on Illness, while matching performance on
strictly periodic Weather and ETT series.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses deep learning and machine learning to predict XRP/USDT closing prices, highlighting the importance of liquidity metrics like VVR and VWAP for accuracy. LSTM outperforms other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency price prediction often ignores liquidity, a key factor. This study aims to improve accuracy by incorporating liquidity metrics.

Method: Four models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) were trained with and without liquidity proxies (VVR, VWAP) to compare performance.

Result: LSTM consistently outperformed other models, showing liquidity metrics enhance prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating liquidity metrics is crucial for accurate cryptocurrency price forecasting, benefiting traders and developers.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing rapid growth, but this expansion
comes with significant challenges, particularly in predicting cryptocurrency
prices for traders in the U.S. In this study, we explore how deep learning and
machine learning models can be used to forecast the closing prices of the
XRP/USDT trading pair. While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models
focus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market
liquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we
introduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio
(VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a
clearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing
the accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning
models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks,
using historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and
evaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the
liquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with
and without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed
the others. These results underscore the importance of considering market
liquidity when predicting cryptocurrency closing prices. Therefore,
incorporating these liquidity metrics is essential for more accurate
forecasting models. Our findings offer valuable insights for traders and
developers seeking to create smarter and more risk-aware strategies in the U.S.
digital assets market.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting model, outperforms existing methods by addressing spectral disparity and hierarchical diversity in extreme events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to predict diversified extreme weather events due to their focus on general conditions or specific extremes, ignoring real-world atmospheric patterns.

Method: Proposes UniExtreme with two modules: Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) for spectral differences and Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) for hierarchical diversity.

Result: UniExtreme surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both extreme and general weather forecasting.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates superior adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios, addressing key limitations in current approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of
Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict
extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on
general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting
the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this
work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral
disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and
geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose
UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that
integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures
region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through
learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation,
and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates
region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity
and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior
adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

TL;DR: A GAN-based augmentation framework using Mahalanobis-GMM and nearest-neighbor matching to address imbalanced regression by identifying and enriching minority samples without preset thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced regression poses challenges as models struggle with underrepresented samples due to skewed target distributions. Existing methods rely on fixed thresholds, failing to capture true rare regions.

Method: Proposes a data-driven GAN-based framework with Mahalanobis-GMM for minority sample identification and deterministic nearest-neighbor matching to augment sparse regions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation methods on 32 benchmark imbalanced regression datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses imbalanced regression by dynamically identifying and enriching rare samples, improving model performance.

Abstract: Imbalanced regression arises when the target distribution is skewed, causing
models to focus on dense regions and struggle with underrepresented (minority)
samples. Despite its relevance across many applications, few methods have been
designed specifically for this challenge. Existing approaches often rely on
fixed, ad hoc thresholds to label samples as rare or common, overlooking the
continuous complexity of the joint feature-target space and fail to represent
the true underlying rare regions. To address these limitations, we propose a
fully data-driven GAN-based augmentation framework that uses
Mahalanobis-Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to automatically identify minority
samples and employs deterministic nearest-neighbour matching to enrich sparse
regions. Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine
which observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced
regression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

TL;DR: Proposes a method to reduce latency in AI-based CASP systems using speculative beam search and Medusa drafting, improving throughput for drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High latency in CASP systems limits their use in high-throughput synthesizability screening for drug design.

Method: Uses speculative beam search and Medusa drafting to accelerate SMILES-to-SMILES transformers in multi-step synthesis planning.

Result: Increases solved molecules by 26% to 86% under the same time constraints.

Conclusion: The method enhances CASP system performance, meeting latency needs for high-throughput screening and user experience.

Abstract: AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as
components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of
such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability
screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating
multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES
transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the
latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning
in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable
drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our
approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the
same time constraints of several seconds. Our method brings AI-based CASP
systems closer to meeting the strict latency requirements of high-throughput
synthesizability screening and improving general user experience.

*Ivan Karpukhin,Andrey Savchenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers underperform RNNs in sequence classification tasks due to lack of a compact state vector and poor local context capture. The paper introduces history tokens to address this, improving performance in various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers often lag behind RNNs in sequence classification tasks, and the reasons are unclear. The paper aims to explore and address this gap.

Method: The authors propose history tokens to accumulate historical information during pretraining, enhancing transformers' ability to capture local context and sequence representation.

Result: The approach significantly boosts transformer performance in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks.

Conclusion: History tokens effectively address transformers' limitations, making them competitive with RNNs in sequence classification tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data,
including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series.
Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks.
However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the
objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of
transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and
effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that
contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context,
which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we
introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of
historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach
significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results
in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on
GitHub.

TL;DR: AutochaosNet is a hyperparameter-free variant of Neurochaos Learning (NL) that eliminates training and parameter tuning, using a universal chaotic sequence for feature extraction. It achieves competitive or superior performance with reduced computational effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of NL, which requires hyperparameter tuning and high computational effort, by proposing a simpler, more efficient alternative.

Method: AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence from the Champernowne constant and uses input stimuli to define firing time bounds for feature extraction. Simplified variants (TM AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet) are also introduced.

Result: AutochaosNet achieves competitive or superior classification performance compared to ChaosNet, with significantly reduced training time and excellent generalization.

Conclusion: AutochaosNet is a scalable, efficient solution for real-world classification tasks, eliminating training and hyperparameter tuning. Future work will explore universal chaotic orbits to further enhance performance.

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) is a brain-inspired classification framework that
employs chaotic dynamics to extract features from input data and yields state
of the art performance on classification tasks. However, NL requires the tuning
of multiple hyperparameters and computing of four chaotic features per input
sample. In this paper, we propose AutochaosNet - a novel, hyperparameter-free
variant of the NL algorithm that eliminates the need for both training and
parameter optimization. AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence
derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define
firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM
AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL
architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves
competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing
training time due to reduced computational effort. In addition to eliminating
training and hyperparameter tuning, AutochaosNet exhibits excellent
generalisation capabilities, making it a scalable and efficient choice for
real-world classification tasks. Future work will focus on identifying
universal orbits under various chaotic maps and incorporating them into the NL
framework to further enhance performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the cooldown phase in the WSD learning rate scheduler for transformers, revealing a bias-variance trade-off and performance improvements with higher β₂ values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mechanisms behind the cooldown phase in transformer training are poorly understood, despite its critical role in performance.

Method: The study focuses on the cooldown phase of the WSD scheduler, analyzing different cooldown shapes and AdamW hyperparameters, and visualizes the loss landscape.

Result: Different cooldown shapes balance exploration and exploitation, with higher β₂ values improving performance. Visualizations support the river valley loss perspective.

Conclusion: Optimizing the cooldown phase is as crucial as traditional hyperparameter tuning for transformer training.

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is essential in transformer training, where the
final annealing plays a crucial role in getting the best performance. However,
the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in
loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive
analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD)
learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes
reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with
shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming
alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations
$\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection
$\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe
consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a
loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during
cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These
findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in
transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown
phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.

*Jiaxing Qiu,Dongliang Guo,Brynne Sullivan,Teague R. Henry,Tom Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InstructTime introduces instruction-based time series editing using natural language, enabling flexible and customizable edits with controllable strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based editors are rigid and lack flexibility in condition format and editing control.

Method: InstructTime embeds time series and natural language instructions into a shared multi-modal space, decoding them for edits. Multi-resolution encoders handle local and global edits.

Result: InstructTime achieves high-quality, controllable edits, generalizes to unseen instructions, and adapts to new conditions via few-shot learning.

Conclusion: InstructTime is a state-of-the-art, flexible, and accessible solution for time series editing.

Abstract: In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time
series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital
patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it
impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing
diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as
conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute-
and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks
customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended
edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of
edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first
instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and
instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then
decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a
structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between
embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits
together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use
synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art
time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable
strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to
unseen conditions through few-shot learning.

Result: Identifies strengths/weaknesses of surrogate models and key factors for accuracy, proposing a holistic framework.

Conclusion: The framework enhances hardware-aware NAS by optimizing latency prediction for GPU devices, balancing cost and efficiency.

Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is one of the most promising
techniques for designing efficient Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for
resource-constrained devices. Surrogate models play a crucial role in
hardware-aware NAS as they enable efficient prediction of performance
characteristics (e.g., inference latency and energy consumption) of different
candidate models on the target hardware device. In this paper, we focus on
building hardware-aware latency prediction models. We study different types of
surrogate models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We perform a
systematic analysis to understand the impact of different factors that can
influence the prediction accuracy of these models, aiming to assess the
importance of each stage involved in the model designing process and identify
methods and policies necessary for designing/training an effective estimation
model, specifically for GPU-powered devices. Based on the insights gained from
the analysis, we present a holistic framework that enables reliable dataset
generation and efficient model generation, considering the overall costs of
different stages of the model generation pipeline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashSVD is a novel framework for SVD-compressed LLMs, reducing peak activation memory by 70.2% without accuracy loss, addressing overlooked activation overhead in prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SVD-based LLM compression methods focus on weight reduction but ignore activation memory overhead, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: FlashSVD integrates rank-aware streaming inference, fusing low-rank projection kernels into self-attention and FFN pipelines to avoid full-size activation buffers.

Result: FlashSVD reduces peak activation memory by 70.2% and transient memory by 75% with no accuracy loss.

Conclusion: FlashSVD enables practical deployment of SVD-compressed LLMs by efficiently managing activation memory.

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a
simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a
growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal
accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing
the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional
activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated
factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this
activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,
prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in
peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,
on-device deployments.
  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference
framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.
FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based
methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly
into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD
avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the
truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the
fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra
latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak
activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all
while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a
practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.

*Menglin Kong,Vincent Zhihao Zheng,Lijun Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to improve long-term forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity using spectral initialization and frequency-constrained optimization, enhancing deep temporal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern deep forecasting models often fail to capture recurring periodic patterns due to spectral bias and lack of frequency-aware inductive priors.

Method: Extracts dominant low-frequency components via FFT-guided coordinate descent, initializes sinusoidal embeddings, and uses a two-speed learning schedule to preserve frequency structure.

Result: Consistent performance gains in real-world benchmarks, especially at long horizons, and accurate recovery of ground-truth frequencies in synthetic data.

Conclusion: Injecting spectral priors into deep temporal models improves robustness and interpretability in long-range forecasting.

Abstract: Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from
physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep
forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to
spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this
gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term
forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization
and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant
low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate
descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a
two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during
training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse
real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at
long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep
temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover,
on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies,
further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent
periodic patterns.

TL;DR: A generative optimization framework using fine-tuned diffusion models and reward-directed sampling improves engineering designs, achieving significant performance gains beyond training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating high-performance engineering designs where performance metrics rely on costly or non-differentiable simulations.

Method: Combines parametric design representation with reward-directed sampling in a Markov decision process, using soft-value guidance during training and inference.

Result: Achieves 25% resistance reduction in 3D ship hull design and over 10% lift-to-drag ratio improvement in 2D airfoil design.

Conclusion: The framework enhances designer productivity and design performance, extending beyond training data distributions.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework that builds on a
fine-tuned diffusion model and reward-directed sampling to generate
high-performance engineering designs. The framework adopts a parametric
representation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets
corresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of
the reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which
performance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models
(e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or
prohibitively expensive to differentiate. This work introduces the iterative
use of a soft value function within a Markov decision process framework to
achieve reward-guided decoding in the diffusion model. By incorporating
soft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed
approach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs,
even beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative
reward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion
models to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and
enhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed
framework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,
resulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and
over 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil
design. Successful integration of this model into the engineering design life
cycle can enhance both designer productivity and overall design performance.

of machine learning (ML) and remains hindered by the cost of coaching and
specialized equipment. This study presents a novel AI-based coaching system
that uses ML models trained on motion data and delivers stroke feedback via a
large language model (LLM). Participants were recruited through a collaboration
with the NYU Concrete Canoe Team. Motion data were collected across two
sessions, one with suboptimal form and one with corrected technique, using
Apple Watches and smartphones secured in sport straps. The data underwent
stroke segmentation and feature extraction. ML models, including Support Vector
Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees,
were trained on both raw and engineered features. A web based interface was
developed to visualize stroke quality and deliver LLM-based feedback. Across
four participants, eight trials yielded 66 stroke samples. The Extremely
Randomized Tree model achieved the highest performance with an F score of
0.9496 under five fold cross validation. The web interface successfully
provided both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. Sensor placement
near the wrists improved data quality. Preliminary results indicate that
smartwatches and smartphones can enable low cost, accessible alternatives to
traditional paddling instruction. While limited by sample size, the study
demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer devices and ML to support stroke
refinement and technique improvement.

*Ahmed Jaheen,Sarah Elsamanody,Hamada Rizk,Moustafa Youssef*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SimDeep is a Federated Learning framework designed to address non-IID data and device heterogeneity in indoor localization, achieving 92.89% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in deploying indoor localization due to non-IID data and device heterogeneity.

Method: SimDeep uses a Similarity Aggregation Strategy in Federated Learning to handle non-IID data.

Result: Achieves 92.89% accuracy, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: SimDeep is viable for real-world indoor localization deployment.

Abstract: Indoor localization plays a pivotal role in supporting a wide array of
location-based services, including navigation, security, and context-aware
computing within intricate indoor environments. Despite considerable
advancements, deploying indoor localization systems in real-world scenarios
remains challenging, largely because of non-independent and identically
distributed (non-IID) data and device heterogeneity. In response, we propose
SimDeep, a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework explicitly crafted to
overcome these obstacles and effectively manage device heterogeneity. SimDeep
incorporates a Similarity Aggregation Strategy, which aggregates client model
updates based on data similarity, significantly alleviating the issues posed by
non-IID data. Our experimental evaluations indicate that SimDeep achieves an
impressive accuracy of 92.89%, surpassing traditional federated and centralized
techniques, thus underscoring its viability for real-world deployment.

### [167] [The Vanishing Gradient Problem for Stiff Neural Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01519)
*Colby Fronk,Linda Petzold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes vanishing gradients in stiff neural ODEs, proving it's a universal issue for A-stable and L-stable integration schemes, limiting training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why parameter sensitivities vanish in stiff systems during training, hindering optimization.

Method: Analyzes the rational stability function of stiff integration schemes, providing explicit formulas and proving decay rates.

Result: Shows parameter sensitivities decay to zero in stiff regimes, with a slowest decay rate of O(|z|^-1).

Conclusion: All A-stable methods inherently suppress gradients in stiff systems, posing challenges for training stiff neural ODEs.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other
parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to
differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff
systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling
fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to
optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient
phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature
of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze
the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and
demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the
derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness.
Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which
illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the
slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is
$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping
methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a
significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural
ODEs.

*Sahil Sethi,David Chen,Michael C. Burkhart,Nipun Bhandari,Bashar Ramadan,Brett Beaulieu-Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prototype-based neural networks trained for ECG classification capture clinically meaningful patterns, showing strong associations with hospital discharge diagnoses beyond their original training objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if prototype-based models, trained for classification, can align with broader clinical phenotypes and provide interpretable insights into physiological data.

Method: A prototype-based deep learning model was trained on the PTB-XL dataset for ECG classification and tested on the MIMIC-IV database to assess associations with hospital discharge diagnoses (phecodes).

Result: Prototypes showed stronger associations with clinical outcomes than class predictions or NLP-extracted concepts, with high predictive performance (AUCs 0.89-0.91) for conditions like atrial fibrillation and heart failure.

Conclusion: Prototype-based models offer interpretable and transferable intermediate phenotypes, capturing clinically meaningful signatures from physiological data.

Abstract: Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing
inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data.
While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological
data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying
structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a
prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification
using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on
the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes,
trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge
diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual
prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations
with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions,
NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode
categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit
significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the
model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within
diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance
across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation
to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for
non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest
that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from
physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes
that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original
training objectives.

*Jingyi Chen,Xinyuan Zhang,Xinwu Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic method using an unsupervised graph neural network solves the NP-hard Elementary Shortest-Path Problem (ESPP) with near-optimal results by learning node values and edge probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ESPP is NP-hard due to negative-cost cycles, requiring efficient solutions.

Method: An unsupervised graph neural network learns node values and edge probabilities via a surrogate loss, reducing negative cycles and aligning with the algorithm. A decoding algorithm converts probabilities into paths.

Result: The method outperforms baselines and heuristics on graphs up to 100 nodes, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: The approach effectively solves ESPP with high performance and generalization.

Abstract: The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s
to t that visits each vertex at most once. The presence of negative-cost cycles
renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding
near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly
learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate
loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding
near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and
embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding
algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path.
Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method
surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while
exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on
unseen synthetic graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces KANMixer, a KAN-based model for LTSF, outperforming MLP-based methods by leveraging adaptive basis functions for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLP-based methods for LTSF lack hierarchical locality and sequential biases, leading to diminishing improvements. KAN's adaptive capabilities offer a potential solution.

Method: Proposes KANMixer, integrating KAN's adaptive basis functions into a multi-scale mixing backbone for LTSF.

Result: KANMixer achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16/28 experiments across seven datasets, demonstrating KAN's superiority over MLPs.

Conclusion: KAN's adaptive flexibility transforms structural prior influence, with critical design factors identified for effective LTSF use.

Abstract: In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have
demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF).
Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external
modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures.
Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality
and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent
studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these
limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed
model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation
of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new
modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise
architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages
KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven
benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we
systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison
with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive
flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the
influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore,
we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer
practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these
insights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively
leveraging KAN in LTSF. Code is available in the supplementary file.

### [171] [Dynamic Clustering for Personalized Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01580)
*Heting Liu,Junzhe Huang,Fang He,Guohong Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DC-PFL introduces dynamic clustering and model discrepancy for personalized federated learning, improving accuracy and reducing training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data heterogeneity in federated learning without exposing raw data.

Method: Dynamic clustering based on model discrepancy, layer-wise aggregation, and training loss curve analysis.

Result: Reduced training time and improved model accuracy compared to baselines.

Conclusion: DC-PFL effectively handles data heterogeneity and enhances federated learning performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a
global model, but it may not perform well when clients have high data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for
personalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data
heterogeneity. DC-PFL starts with all clients training a global model and
gradually groups the clients into smaller clusters for model personalization
based on their data similarities. To address the challenge of estimating data
heterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric
called model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on
the model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy
is strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as
a reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change
grouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period
of the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation
mechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to
reduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs. We conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate our proposed algorithm,
and our results show that DC-PFL significantly reduces total training time and
improves model accuracy compared to baselines.

*Euihyun Kim,Keun Park,Yeoneung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop diffusion framework improves topology optimization by integrating human feedback to detect and correct design flaws, enhancing realism and manufacturability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for topology optimization rely on surrogate predictors that may miss critical design flaws, necessitating human expertise for correction.

Method: A lightweight reward model trained on binary human feedback is used to modulate the reverse diffusion trajectory, suppressing unrealistic outputs without retraining the diffusion model.

Result: Preliminary results show reduced failure modes (e.g., floating components) and improved design realism across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: The framework bridges automated design generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable, trustworthy solution for generative design.

Abstract: Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation
of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often
rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to
capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or
boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we
propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the
generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human
feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling,
our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse
diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we
collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers
to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are
then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator,
guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but
also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and
requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show
substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across
diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design
generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy
generative design.

*Juyan Zhang,Rhys Newbury,Xinyang Zhang,Tin Tran,Dana Kulic,Michael Burke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper justifies the heuristic weighting function in denoising score matching by showing heteroskedasticity is inherent. It derives optimal weighting functions and reveals the heuristic's effectiveness in reducing variance for stable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work used heuristic weighting for denoising score matching without formal justification. This work aims to provide a principled derivation and understanding of optimal weighting functions.

Method: The study demonstrates heteroskedasticity in denoising score matching, derives optimal weighting functions for arbitrary-order losses, and compares heuristic and optimal weightings theoretically and empirically.

Result: The heuristic weighting function is shown to be a first-order Taylor approximation of the optimal weighting. It achieves lower variance in parameter gradients, aiding stable training.

Conclusion: The heuristic weighting, despite its simplicity, is effective for denoising score matching, offering practical advantages over optimal weighting in training stability and efficiency.

Abstract: Score matching enables the estimation of the gradient of a data distribution,
a key component in denoising diffusion models used to recover clean data from
corrupted inputs. In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used
for the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this
work, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the
denoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled
derivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order
denoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise
distribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant
to diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting
function arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the
expected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical
comparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity,
can achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter
gradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training.

*En Yu,Jie Lu,Kun Wang,Xiaoyu Yang,Guangquan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAMEL is a dynamic framework for learning from heterogeneous data streams, using specialized experts and a collaboration mechanism to handle concept drifts and improve generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with heterogeneous streams and static architectures, limiting adaptability in dynamic environments.

Method: CAMEL assigns independent systems to each stream, uses private experts for stream-specific patterns, and employs an assistance expert with multi-head attention for collaboration. An Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) manages expert lifecycles dynamically.

Result: CAMEL shows superior generalizability and resilience against concept drifts in diverse multistream scenarios.

Conclusion: CAMEL effectively addresses heterogeneity and concept drifts, offering a robust and adaptable solution for multistream learning.

Abstract: Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally
challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts.
Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static
architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability
in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a
dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by
assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor
and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private
experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially,
collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated
assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to
distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent
streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating
negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an
Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert
lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging
concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes
obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient
mechanism for online model capacity adaptation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CAMEL's superior generalizability across diverse multistreams and
exceptional resilience against complex concept drifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparency in state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs hinders replication and research progress.

Method: Developed EPRLI on the GRPO framework with difficulty-aware intervention for math problems, tested on a 1.5B-parameter LLM.

Result: Achieved 50.0% on AIME24, 89.2% on Math500, 77.1% on AMC, 35.3% on Minerva, and 51.9% on OBench, outperforming O1-Preview and matching O1-mini.

Conclusion: EPRLI demonstrates competitive performance, offering a replicable alternative to proprietary models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of large
language models, with reinforcement learning serving as the key technique to
draw out complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs, such as those in the OpenAI O series, Claude 3 series,
DeepMind's Gemini 2.5 series, and Grok 3 series, remain undisclosed, making it
difficult for the research community to replicate their reinforcement learning
training results. Therefore, we start our study from an Early Preview
Reinforcement Learning (EPRLI) algorithm built on the open-source GRPO
framework, incorporating difficulty-aware intervention for math problems.
Applied to a 1.5B-parameter LLM, our method achieves 50.0% on AIME24, 89.2% on

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Augmented Reinforcement Learning (ARL) framework to enhance decision-making in ML models by using external agents for feedback and data quality assurance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the 'Garbage-In, Garbage-Out' problem in reinforcement learning, ensuring better data inputs and actions.

Method: Uses two external agents: one for real-time feedback and another for curated feedback, applied to document identification and extraction.

Result: Human feedback improves model robustness and accuracy, especially in complex environments.

Conclusion: ARL offers a scalable way to boost model performance by combining machine efficiency with human insight.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning
framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine
learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on
model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated
scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the
priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs
or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates
two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality
data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time
evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model,
identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External
Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and
accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training
cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world
scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This
problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere.
The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done
correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback
significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness
and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of
machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly
in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that
human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a
scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

*Yandong Yan,Chenxi Li,Yu Huang,Dexuan Xu,Jiaqi Zhu,Zhongyan Chai,Huamin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TCDiff, a novel EHR generation framework, addresses limitations in synthesizing heterogeneous multimodal EHR data by cascading three diffusion networks, outperforming baselines by 10% in fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality EHRs and limitations of existing methods in handling heterogeneous, incomplete data, especially in Traditional Chinese Medicine, drive the need for TCDiff.

Method: TCDiff uses three cascaded diffusion networks (Reference Modalities Diffusion, Cross-Modal Bridging, Target Modality Diffusion) to model and generate EHR data.

Result: TCDiff outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 10% in data fidelity under various missing rates and maintains strong privacy.

Conclusion: TCDiff is effective, robust, and generalizable for real-world healthcare EHR synthesis.

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs)
remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large
foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial
volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has
emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series
of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of
heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual
modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle
pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex
Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades
three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data,
formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion,
Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate
our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and
introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking.
Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate,
while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the
effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world
healthcare scenarios.

*Xindi Fan,Jing Wu,Mingyi Zhou,Pengwei Liang,Dinh Phung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a method for selective data forgetting without needing the retain set, using gradient ascent and dynamic influence-based unlearning intensities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models' vulnerability to attacks and data memorization raises privacy concerns, necessitating machine unlearning (MU) methods that don't require retain set access.

Method: IMU uses gradient ascent and dynamically allocates unlearning intensities based on data point influences, requiring only the forget set.

Result: IMU outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods in vision and language tasks.

Conclusion: IMU is an effective, retain-data-free solution for machine unlearning, enhancing privacy and scalability.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks
and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about
privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),
i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points
upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full
fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the
original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and
storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but
some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain
set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this
paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet
effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU
employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of
unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.
This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while
maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate
that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAC-MoE addresses GPU memory and inference speed issues in MoE-LLMs via quantization and pruning, introducing QESC and PESF modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE-LLMs face high GPU memory usage and inefficient inference due to low activated parameters.

Method: Proposes QESC for quantization bias mitigation and PESF for pruning less-used experts.

Result: Reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: EAC-MoE effectively optimizes MoE-LLMs for practical deployment.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated promising potential in scaling
LLMs. However, it is hindered by two critical challenges: (1) substantial GPU
memory consumption to load all experts; (2) low activated parameters cannot be
equivalently translated into inference acceleration effects. In this work, we
propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which
deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of
quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two
challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit
quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in
MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection
Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating
the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not
crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore,
we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which
significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts
for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal
performance degradation.

*Wenzhuo Qian,Hailiang Zhao,Tianlv Chen,Jiayi Chen,Ziqi Wang,Kingsum Chow,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: USRFNet, a deep learning network, improves microservice performance monitoring by separating and modeling traffic-side and resource-side features, outperforming existing methods in predicting P95 tail latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microservices' distributed nature complicates performance monitoring. Traditional latency metrics are noisy and lack holistic insights, while existing methods fail to handle heterogeneous data or integrate complementary signals effectively.

Method: USRFNet uses GNNs for service interactions and gMLP for resource dynamics, fusing these into a unified system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency.

Result: USRFNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy under large-scale stress testing.

Conclusion: USRFNet addresses key challenges in microservice monitoring, offering a robust solution for accurate latency prediction by integrating traffic and resource features.

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building
scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces
significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management.
Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are
highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior
of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency
provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends
and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in
existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where
traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side
signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled
architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these
complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a
deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and
resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions
and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model
cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified
system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We
evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress
testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction
accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Tianpei Lu,Bingsheng Zhang,Lekun Peng,Bowen Zheng,Lichun Li,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme for secure multi-party computation (MPC) in machine learning, achieving significant speedups by optimizing secure evaluation of floating-point operations and nonlinear functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high communication and computation overhead in secure model inference, especially for privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare, by improving efficiency and privacy in quantized inference methods.

Method: Proposes a layer-wise quantization scheme, supports 1-bit weight layers, and introduces a multi-input lookup table protocol for secure softmax evaluation. Uses dual secret sharing and lookup tables for precision conversions.

Result: Achieves up to 8×, 9×, and 22× speedups compared to prior works, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements in secure inference.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances both privacy and efficiency in secure model inference, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in
privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services,
ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party
computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from
high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the
expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a
promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision
integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing
MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization
parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in
handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we
propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight
fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup
table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we
use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup
tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on
BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$
speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to
Gupta \emph{et al}. (PETS 24) and $22 \times$ speedup compared to Knott
\emph{et al}. (NeurIPS 21).

TL;DR: SPARTA leverages spike-timing dynamics for efficient sparse attention in SNNs, reducing complexity while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SNNs overlook precise spike-timing information, missing computational cues.

Method: SPARTA uses heterogeneous neuron dynamics and spike-timing to prioritize tokens, achieving 65.4% sparsity via competitive gating.

Result: Achieves SOTA on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%).

Conclusion: Exploiting spike timing improves computational efficiency and accuracy in SNNs.

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics
inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while
overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues.
We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal
Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and
spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA
prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike
timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive
gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention
complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and
competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating
that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency
and accuracy.

### [184] [Boosting Generalization Performance in Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning Using Variational Transposed Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01669)
*Ziru Niu,Hai Dong,A. K. Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-heterogeneous FL framework improves generalization by exchanging feature distributions (mean, covariance) instead of model parameters, using synthetic data from a VTC network for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity in FL reduces generalization; existing methods fail for heterogeneous model architectures.

Method: Clients share feature distributions; train a VTC network to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning.

Result: Higher generalization accuracy, lower communication costs, and memory usage compared to existing frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses data heterogeneity in FL without model aggregation.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a pioneering machine learning paradigm that
enables distributed clients to process local data effectively while ensuring
data privacy. However, the efficacy of FL is usually impeded by the data
heterogeneity among clients, resulting in local models with low generalization
performance. To address this problem, traditional model-homogeneous approaches
mainly involve debiasing the local training procedures with regularization or
dynamically adjusting client weights in aggregation. Nonetheless, these
approaches become incompatible for scenarios where clients exhibit
heterogeneous model architectures. In this paper, we propose a
model-heterogeneous FL framework that can improve clients' generalization
performance over unseen data without model aggregation. Instead of model
parameters, clients exchange the feature distributions with the server,
including the mean and the covariance. Accordingly, clients train a variational
transposed convolutional (VTC) neural network with Gaussian latent variables
sampled from the feature distributions, and use the VTC model to generate
synthetic data. By fine-tuning local models with the synthetic data, clients
significantly increase their generalization performance. Experimental results
show that our approach obtains higher generalization accuracy than existing
model-heterogeneous FL frameworks, as well as lower communication costs and
memory consumption

*Ali Forootani,Raffaele Iervolino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) to handle non-convex objectives and heterogeneous datasets, introducing staleness-aware aggregation and dynamic learning rates to improve convergence and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FL faces challenges like communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler effects, which AFL mitigates but lacks support for non-convex objectives and heterogeneous data.

Method: The paper proposes a staleness-aware aggregation method and dynamic learning rate schedule, along with rigorous convergence analysis for non-convex AFL.

Result: The framework improves stability and convergence in asynchronous, heterogeneous FL scenarios, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: The approach is practical for real-world applications, accommodating computational, data, and communication variations while enhancing performance and scalability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, traditional FL
suffers from communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler
effects. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) addresses these by allowing
clients to update independently, improving scalability and reducing
synchronization delays. This paper extends AFL to handle non-convex objective
functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We
present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected
gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and
heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware
aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate
schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability
and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power,
data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world
applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection
strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence.
Implemented in PyTorch with Python's asyncio, our approach is validated through
experiments demonstrating improved performance and scalability for
asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

### [186] [Generalized Kernelized Bandits: Self-Normalized Bernstein-Like Dimension-Free Inequality and Regret Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01681)
*Alberto Maria Metelli,Simone Drago,Marco Mussi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces generalized kernelized bandits (GKBs), combining kernelized and generalized linear bandits, and proposes GKB-UCB, an optimistic algorithm, with a novel self-normalized inequality for regret analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify and extend kernelized bandits (KBs) and generalized linear bandits (GLBs) by optimizing an unknown function in an RKHS with exponential family noise.

Method: Proposes GKB-UCB, an optimistic algorithm, and develops a new self-normalized Bernstein-like inequality for regret analysis.

Result: Derives a regret bound of order ~O(γ_T √(T/κ_*)), matching state-of-the-art bounds for KBs and GLBs.

Conclusion: The work provides a unified view of KBs and GLBs with tight regret guarantees.

Abstract: We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized
kernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$
belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples
generated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear
function $\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and
generalized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB,
and we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not
allow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel
self-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to
Freedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution
of independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB,
deriving a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$,
being $T$ the learning horizon, ${\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and
$\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our
result matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the
state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of
both settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid tokenisation method for tabular data is introduced, combining fixed tokens for structure and BPE for high-cardinality values, tested on a NetFlow dataset with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and LLMs to structured tabular data, which existing methods fail to cohesively encode.

Method: A hybrid tokenisation approach using fixed tokens for structural elements and BPE for high-cardinality/continuous values, applied to a NetFlow dataset.

Result: Processed 31M network flows in <5 hours with 6.18:1 compression, creating a 1B-token corpus for NIDS foundation models.

Conclusion: The method is efficient and generalisable for training foundation models on structured data.

Abstract: Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning,
particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and
Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods
often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features
or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel,
hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a
unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines
predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality
categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset
(CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient,
processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a
significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a
computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a
viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured
data.

### [188] [Explaining Time Series Classifiers with PHAR: Rule Extraction and Fusion from Post-hoc Attributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01687)
*Maciej Mozolewski,Szymon Bobek,Grzegorz J. Nalepa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHAR is a framework that converts numeric feature attributions into human-readable rules for time series classification, improving interpretability and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models for time series classification are hard to interpret due to raw data complexity and high dimensionality. PHAR aims to enhance transparency by transforming attributions into structured rules.

Method: PHAR transforms feature attributions from explainers like LIME or SHAP into interpretable rules. It includes a rule fusion step to consolidate rules and visualization techniques to balance specificity and generalization.

Result: PHAR performs comparably to rule-based methods like Anchor, scales efficiently for long sequences, and improves explanation fidelity and consistency.

Conclusion: PHAR enhances interpretability and transparency in time series classification, resolving conflicting explanations and providing domain-adaptable insights.

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification
remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and
the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc
Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature
attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into
structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals
that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model
transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as
Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving
broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets
using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing
key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures
each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both
explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization
techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived
rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect
of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights.
Comprehensive experiments on UCI datasets demonstrate that PHAR improves
interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS
classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HAR systems rely on single modalities, limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments.

Method: Uses FedTime-MAGNET with MAGNET for multimodal fusion and a T5 encoder for temporal dependencies.

Result: Achieves centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and federated F1 Score of 0.881.

Conclusion: Combining multimodal fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning improves HAR accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as
fitness tracking, smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. Traditional HAR
systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras,
limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents
FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances
HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and
accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert
Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a
Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across
modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder
only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive
experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance,
achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of
0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal
fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and
robust HAR systems.

*Yeongjong Kim,Yeoneung Kim,Minseok Kim,Namkyeong Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI) framework is proposed for solving stochastic optimal control problems using second-order HJB equations, with systematic error control and theoretical interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings and provide theoretical guarantees for policy quality evaluation during training.

Method: Trains a neural network to approximate the value function by minimizing the residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy, enabling systematic error control and explicit bounds on gradient errors.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on benchmark problems like stochastic cartpole, pendulum, and high-dimensional LQR problems up to 10D.

Conclusion: The PINN-PI framework successfully extends deterministic methods to stochastic problems, offering interpretability and convergence guarantees.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI)
framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by
second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a
neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the
residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure
enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and
allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value
gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides
a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method
extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings,
inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy
iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems
and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.

TL;DR: CcGAN-AVAR improves CcGAN by addressing data imbalance and computational inefficiency, offering faster inference and better generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like CcGAN and CCDM have limitations: CcGAN suffers from data imbalance, and CCDM is computationally expensive.

Method: CcGAN-AVAR introduces adaptive vicinity and a multi-task discriminator for better training, leveraging GAN's one-step generation.

Result: Achieves 300x-2000x faster inference and state-of-the-art generation quality on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: CcGAN-AVAR effectively overcomes prior limitations, balancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional
Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions
conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or
temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN
suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM
requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR,
an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the
GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling
bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel
components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism
that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that
constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density
ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across
eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves
state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OccamVTS distills 1% of essential predictive information from large vision models into lightweight networks, improving accuracy by eliminating irrelevant visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision models (LVMs) enhance time series forecasting but contain 99% unnecessary parameters, which can impair accuracy due to irrelevant high-level semantics.

Method: Proposes OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework using pyramid-style feature alignment and correlation distillation to transfer only beneficial patterns.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 1% of original parameters, excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Aggressive parameter reduction improves forecasting accuracy by focusing on essential temporal patterns and filtering out semantic noise.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent
approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns
through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance
forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time
series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with
low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair
forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework
that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into
lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS
employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature
distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic
noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves
accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while
preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters,
particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high energy costs of cloud GPUs due to low-latency demands of LLMs, coupled with dynamic workload volatility, create a need for efficient power management without sacrificing performance.

Method: AGFT employs online reinforcement learning to autonomously learn optimal frequency tuning policies, using real-time monitoring and fine-grained frequency control.

Result: AGFT saves 44.3% GPU energy with under 10% latency overhead, achieving a 40.3% Energy-Delay Product optimization.

Conclusion: AGFT enhances energy efficiency and economic benefits of LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.

Abstract: The explosive growth of interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) has placed
unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into
high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference
workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial
energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power
management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without
compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An
Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement
learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By
monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes
fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action
space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust,
automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an
environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The
experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU
energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of
under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay
Product (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework
can significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of
existing LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of energy-intensive computation, communication, and non-i.i.d. data in federated learning for resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Integrates diffusion-based data augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and adaptive power control. Uses Bayesian optimization to jointly tune these components.

Result: Achieves superior convergence speed and energy efficiency in experiments on representative CV tasks.

Conclusion: FedDPQ is the first framework to jointly optimize FL performance from data, computation, and communication perspectives under unreliable wireless conditions.

Abstract: Emerging real-time computer vision (CV) applications on wireless edge devices
demand energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning. Federated learning
(FL) enables on-device training without raw data sharing, yet remains
challenging in resource-constrained environments due to energy-intensive
computation and communication, as well as limited and non-i.i.d. local data. We
propose FedDPQ, an ultra energy-efficient FL framework for real-time CV over
unreliable wireless networks. FedDPQ integrates diffusion-based data
augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and transmission power
control to enhance training efficiency. It expands local datasets using
synthetic data, reduces computation through pruning, compresses updates via
quantization, and mitigates transmission outages with adaptive power control.
We further derive a closed-form energy-convergence model capturing the coupled
impact of these components, and develop a Bayesian optimization(BO)-based
algorithm to jointly tune data augmentation strategy, pruning ratio,
quantization level, and power control. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to jointly optimize FL performance from the perspectives of
data, computation, and communication under unreliable wireless conditions.
Experiments on representative CV tasks show that FedDPQ achieves superior
convergence speed and energy efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address semantic misalignment between generated trajectories and conditioning covariates in diffusion models under complex or multimodal conditions.

Method: Introduces a scoring network to evaluate semantic alignment and uses stepwise importance reweighting to adjust sampling paths without altering training.

Result: Consistent gains in predictive accuracy and covariate alignment, especially in complex conditioning scenarios.

Conclusion: SemGuide is a model-agnostic, plug-and-play method that enhances diffusion models' performance in forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series
forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated
trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or
multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a
plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in
conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to
assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future
covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance
reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without
altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and
compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world
forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and
covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex
conditioning scenarios.

Motivation: To replace manually defined gradient estimators (e.g., ADAM) with a trainable optimization strategy for better performance and efficiency.

Method: Proposes pseudo-linear TO, a linear approximation of full gradients, and two simplified variants. Jointly trains gradient estimators and model weights.

Result: TO methods converge faster than benchmarks (e.g., ADAM) in convex and non-convex settings, including LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Trainable optimizers like pseudo-linear TO offer efficient, high-performance alternatives to traditional gradient estimators.

Abstract: The concept of learning to optimize involves utilizing a trainable

gradient estimator and the trainable weights of the model. Specifically, we
prove that pseudo-linear TO (Trainable Optimizer), a linear approximation of
the full gradient, matches SGD's convergence rate while effectively reducing
variance. Pseudo-linear TO incurs negligible computational overhead, requiring
only minimal additional tensor multiplications. To further improve
computational efficiency, we introduce two simplified variants of Pseudo-linear
TO. Experiments demonstrate that TO methods converge faster than benchmark
algorithms (e.g., ADAM) in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, and
fine tuning of an LLM.

*Shiyan Liu,Bohan Tan,Yan Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAGPO, a novel method combining ResNet and Transformer for solving routing problems like TSP and CVRP, improving training efficiency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in training efficiency and generalization of data-driven methods for combinatorial optimization problems like TSP and CVRP.

Method: Proposes VAGPO, leveraging ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, with an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy.

Result: Achieves competitive solution quality and strong generalization to large-scale instances (up to 1000 nodes) without re-training.

Conclusion: VAGPO is effective in learning efficiency and scalability for routing problems.

Abstract: The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial
optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven
optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face
limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances.
In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference
Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging
ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO
captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that
significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient
methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed
VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits
strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without
re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and
scalability.

### [198] [Mitigating Persistent Client Dropout in Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01807)
*Ignacy Stępka,Nicholas Gisolfi,Kacper Trębacz,Artur Dubrawski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses persistent client dropout in asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) and introduces adaptive strategies for recovery, showing effectiveness in maintaining robustness despite limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Client dropout in asynchronous DFL complicates recovery due to obscured model updates and limited access to critical information like learning epochs and data distributions.

Method: Proposes adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction, evaluated on tabular and image datasets with three DFL algorithms and data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid).

Result: Adaptive strategies recover some performance loss caused by dropout, maintaining robustness without precise reconstruction of missing client data.

Conclusion: The strategies are effective but have limitations; future work is needed to further address client dropout challenges.

Abstract: We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization
obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making
recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning
epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely
reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that
obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce
adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these
strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our
work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs
substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed
methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three
data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid). Our
experiments show that the proposed adaptive strategies can be effective in
maintaining robustness of federated learning, even if they do not reconstruct
the missing client's data precisely. We also discuss the limitations and
identify future avenues for tackling the problem of client dropout.

### [199] [Neural Predictive Control to Coordinate Discrete- and Continuous-Time Models for Time-Series Analysis with Control-Theoretical Improvements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01833)
*Haoran Li,Muhao Guo,Yang Weng,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a continuous ODE-based optimal control approach for time-series analysis, combining discrete-time models for context and control-theoretical guarantees for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using unconstrained neural networks struggle with distributional shifts, prompting the need for a more reliable approach.

Method: Recast time-series problems as ODE-based optimal control, using discrete-time models to generate control actions and model predictive control for training.

Result: The method achieves exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions and shows superior generalization in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed coordinate model offers robust and generalizable performance, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis,
such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond
discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward
continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the
underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,
extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the
dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably
under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as
the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics
solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories
toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To
achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and
(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain
rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to
process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to
extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.
During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future
trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal
current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon
optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,
indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable
performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our
method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

### [200] [Causal Discovery in Multivariate Time Series through Mutual Information Featurization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01848)
*Gian Marco Paldino,Gianluca Bontempi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TD2C, a supervised learning framework for discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series by recognizing persistent asymmetries in information flow, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery methods struggle with non-linear dynamics and lack of clear conditional independencies, necessitating a new approach.

Method: Proposes TD2C, a supervised learning framework that uses information-theoretic and statistical descriptors to identify causal patterns in synthetic time series.

Result: TD2C achieves state-of-the-art performance, generalizing well to unseen dynamics and benchmarks, especially in high-dimensional and non-linear scenarios.

Conclusion: TD2C offers a robust and scalable solution for causal discovery in complex systems by shifting from statistical testing to pattern recognition.

Abstract: Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a
fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by
relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests
that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics.
This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to
pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and
learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal
graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce
Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that
operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal
signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical
descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time
series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen
dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C
achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established
methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing
the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for
uncovering causal structures in complex systems.

*Ning Yang,Pengyu Wang,Guoqing Liu,Haifeng Zhang,Pin Lyu,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCPO introduces a proactive penalty mechanism and constraint-aware intrinsic reward to improve stability and reduce constraint violations in Safe RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing issues like constraint violations and instability in Safe RL, which traditional Lagrangian methods fail to mitigate effectively.

Method: Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) with preemptive penalties and boundary-aware exploration.

Result: PCPO shows stability and robustness in experiments, with theoretical bounds on duality gap and performance.

Conclusion: PCPO offers a promising solution for constrained policy optimization, with potential for future research and applications.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as
constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained
policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to
specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems
are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that
may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a
novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that
incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier
items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a
cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide
boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches
the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for
the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the
method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization
performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is
that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental
results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy
optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research
and practical applications.

### [202] [How Does Controllability Emerge In Language Models During Pretraining?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01892)
*Jianshu She,Xinyue Li,Eric Xing,Zhengzhong Liu,Qirong Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how linear steerability in language models emerges during training and introduces the Intervention Detector (ID) to analyze and interpret this process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unclear conditions for effective interventions in language models and how steerability of concepts like emotion or truthfulness develops during training.

Method: The authors propose the Intervention Detector (ID), a unified framework to analyze linear steerability through hidden state and representation analysis, using metrics like heatmaps and cosine similarity.

Result: Linear steerability emerges during intermediate training stages, with closely related concepts showing distinct emergence patterns. ID reveals increasing linear separability of concepts in hidden space, correlating with steerability.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the dynamics of steerability in language models, demonstrating the utility of ID for interpreting and generalizing findings across model families.

Abstract: Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to
control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation.
However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are
often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we
demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e.,
the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states),
emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related
concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct
stages of training.
  To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt
existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the
"Intervention Detector" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear
steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and
representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly
separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates
with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based
metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help
interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we
apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our
findings on steerability dynamics.

### [203] [Revisiting Replay and Gradient Alignment for Continual Pre-Training of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01908)
*Istabrak Abbes,Gopeshh Subbaraj,Matthew Riemer,Nizar Islah,Benjamin Therien,Tsuguchika Tabaru,Hiroaki Kingetsu,Sarath Chandar,Irina Rish*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores continual pre-training for LLMs, comparing experience replay and gradient alignment to mitigate distribution shifts. Both methods stabilize learning without forgetting, with gradient alignment being effective for LLM pre-training. Efficient MER is proposed, and scaling analysis suggests replaying old examples is more valuable than increasing model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiency in retraining LLMs from scratch when new data arrives, the paper investigates continual pre-training methods to avoid performance degradation due to distribution shifts.

Method: The study evaluates experience replay and gradient alignment in continual pre-training of Llama models across languages with 100B tokens per language. It also proposes an efficient MER implementation.

Result: Both replay and gradient alignment stabilize learning without forgetting. Gradient alignment is effective for LLM pre-training, and MER combines replay benefits with gradient alignment efficiently.

Conclusion: Small replay rates are more valuable than scaling model size, but scaling model size is more compute-efficient than high replay rates. Gradient alignment and MER are promising for continual LLM pre-training.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on
massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes
available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual
pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining
from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution
shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this
paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this
distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay
and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the
Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100
billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and
gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This
conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and
diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness
of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose
an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues
experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible
compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay
rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a
more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more
compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of
replaying old examples.

*Xinting Huang,Michael Hahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neighbor Distance Minimization (NDM), an unsupervised method to identify interpretable subspaces in neural models, revealing organized representations of abstract concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how neural models organize and encode different aspects of inputs in separate subspaces, and whether these subspaces can be found unsupervised.

Method: Proposes NDM, an unsupervised technique to learn non-basis-aligned subspaces, validated through qualitative and quantitative analysis, including experiments on GPT-2 circuits.

Result: NDM successfully identifies interpretable subspaces, often corresponding to abstract concepts, and shows scalability in larger models like 2B models.

Conclusion: The findings provide a new approach to understanding model internals and constructing circuits, highlighting the potential of unsupervised subspace discovery.

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of
mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the
representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent
are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it
possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?
Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable
subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor
distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an
unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in
many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the
same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to
``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using
known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and
circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by
finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing.
Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding
model internals and building circuits.

*Zhuomin Chen,Jingchao Ni,Hojat Allah Salehi,Xu Zheng,Dongsheng Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel iterative framework improves GNN explanation robustness by aligning training and explanation graph distributions, enhancing reliability and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the mismatch between training and explanation graphs in GNNs, which leads to unreliable gradients and degraded explanation quality.

Method: An iterative framework alternating between explanation subgraph identification and model adaptation, refining subgraphs progressively.

Result: Consistent improvement in explanation quality across benchmarks and GNN architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively aligns distributions and enhances explanation robustness, adaptable to various GNN backbones.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide
range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions
remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the
graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most
existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight
important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on
which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients
and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse
subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation
framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's
training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during
explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph
identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large
explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this
subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and
non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This
process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative
refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets
using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results
show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be
flexibly integrated with different architectures.

*Yuly Wu,Jiamou Liu,Libo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Transition Machines (TMs) and Dual Behavior Mealy Machines (DBMMs) to address limitations in automaton-based approaches for POMDPs, proposing an efficient learning algorithm (DB-RPNI) with significant speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automaton representations for POMDPs focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem formulations and high computational costs.

Method: The authors introduce TMs to complement Reward Machines (RMs) and propose DBMMs to unify both. They develop DB-RPNI, a passive automata learning algorithm, with optimization techniques for minimal correct automata inference.

Result: DB-RPNI achieves speedups of up to three orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed DBMM and DB-RPNI effectively address the limitations of existing automaton-based methods, offering a unified and efficient solution for learning in partially observable environments.

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to
many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially
observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations.
Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective
approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations
focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem
formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For
the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement
existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for
both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that
subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata
learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly
reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques
and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.
Experimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of
magnitude over SOTA baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if gradient-based meta-learning can enhance neural networks' ability to learn abstract concepts efficiently from few examples.

Method: Comparison of meta-learning methods with supervised learning on Boolean tasks generated by a PCFG, varying concept dimensionality and compositionality.

Result: Meta-learners excel at compositional complexity, with improved performance and sample efficiency. Second-order methods and extended gradient adaptation enhance generalization.

Conclusion: Meta-learning is effective for few-shot concept learning, particularly for compositional tasks, and highlights the benefits of advanced optimization techniques.

Abstract: Rapidly learning abstract concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of
human intelligence. This work investigates whether gradient-based meta-learning
can equip neural networks with inductive biases for efficient few-shot
acquisition of discrete concepts. We compare meta-learning methods against a
supervised learning baseline on Boolean tasks generated by a probabilistic
context-free grammar (PCFG). By systematically varying concept dimensionality
(number of features) and compositionality (depth of grammar recursion), we
identify regimes in which meta-learning robustly improves few-shot concept
learning. We find improved performance and sample efficiency by training a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) across concept spaces increasing in dimensional and
compositional complexity. We are able to show that meta-learners are much
better able to handle compositional complexity than featural complexity and
establish an empirical analysis demonstrating how featural complexity shapes
'concept basins' of the loss landscape, allowing curvature-aware optimization
to be more effective than first order methods. We see that we can robustly
increase generalization on complex concepts by increasing the number of
adaptation steps in meta-SGD, encouraging exploration of rougher loss basins.
Overall, this work highlights the intricacies of learning compositional versus
featural complexity in high dimensional concept spaces and provides a road to
understanding the role of 2nd order methods and extended gradient adaptation in
few-shot concept learning.

TL;DR: OptiGridML is a neural framework for topology optimization in power grids, replacing NP-hard MIP with GNNs to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of solving NP-hard mixed-integer programs for large power grids motivates the need for a faster, scalable solution.

Method: Uses a two-stage neural architecture: LGNN for DC power flow approximation and HeteroGNN for breaker state prediction, linked by physics-informed loss.

Result: Achieves up to 18% power export improvement and reduces inference time from hours to milliseconds.

Conclusion: Structured, flow-aware GNNs can accelerate combinatorial optimization in physical networked systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete
topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation
breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem
typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and
computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated
MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network
(LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a
heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and
physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these
components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on
synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves
power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing
inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the
potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial
optimization in physical networked systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a latent variable model for Active Feature Acquisition to overcome limitations of Reinforcement Learning and greedy mutual information methods, showing superior performance on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the shortcomings of existing methods like Reinforcement Learning (training difficulties) and greedy mutual information approaches (myopic acquisitions) in Active Feature Acquisition.

Method: Proposes a supervised latent variable model that reasons about features across unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space.

Result: Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the approach reliably outperforms various baselines.

Conclusion: The introduced latent variable model effectively improves Active Feature Acquisition by addressing prior limitations and achieving better performance.

Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making
problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on
current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches
either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or
greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and
unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised
manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many
possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive
evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that
our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.

*Yixin Shen*

TL;DR: Kron-LoRA is a parameter-efficient adapter for fine-tuning large language models, combining Kronecker product factorization and low-rank compression to reduce parameters while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for adapters that are both parameter-efficient and expressive for fine-tuning large pre-trained language models across multiple tasks.

Method: Kron-LoRA factorizes linear updates as a Kronecker product and compresses one factor via low-rank decomposition, reducing parameters while retaining expressivity.

Result: Kron-LoRA matches or outperforms standard LoRA adapters with fewer parameters, supports efficient quantization, and shows competitive cross-task transfer performance.

Conclusion: Kron-LoRA provides a scalable and sustainable solution for multi-task adaptation of large language models, balancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands
adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce
\textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen
linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then
compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA
decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A
\otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the
expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters
than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize
to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further
memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT
and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,
ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an
840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a
5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a
3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy,
Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only
one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task
transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression,
quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis,
Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution
for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using Process Reward Models (PRMs) mid-generation to reject suboptimal reasoning steps early, reducing computational overhead without degrading performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the compute-efficiency of reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging intermediate signals from PRMs.

Method: Introduces the idea of PRMs as Partial Reward Models, using token-level signals for early rejection of suboptimal candidates.

Result: Achieves up to 1.4×-9× reduction in inference FLOPs on math reasoning benchmarks while maintaining final performance.

Conclusion: Early rejection via PRMs is an effective way to enhance compute-efficiency in LLM reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex
reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question
answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling
inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used
to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods
introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large
numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs
can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection
of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We
introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that
the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of
final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on
intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both
theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases
exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong
correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On
math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$
reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results
suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework integrates structured and unstructured EHR data using a two-stage LLM and graph-based retrieval method, achieving high AUC scores for clinical predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate clinical outcome prediction is vital for early intervention and improved patient care, leveraging multimodal EHR data.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) LLM extracts task-relevant info from notes, enhanced by graph-based retrieval; (2) combines unstructured and structured data for predictions.

Result: Achieves AUC scores of 0.84 (readmission) and 0.92 (mortality), outperforming baselines and clinical practices.

Conclusion: The framework enhances LLM-based predictions by integrating structured data, setting a new standard for clinical outcome prediction.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and
improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured
data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific
information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available
information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In
the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial,
task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based
retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus
like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both
unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to
generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical
tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and
in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework
achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,
respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with
positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it
outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including
established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of
the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an
LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with
structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.

*Ziyu Zhou,Yiming Huang,Yanyun Wang,Yuankai Wu,James Kwok,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAFNet, a compact architecture for irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) forecasting, retains Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) and outperforms graph-based models by efficiently handling pre-aligned series with modules for smoothing, compression, and low-cost correlation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMTS modeling is challenging due to uneven sampling and inter-variate asynchrony. CPA, though widely used, inflates series length with zero-padding, while graph-based models struggle with global correlations.

Method: KAFNet combines: (1) Pre-Convolution for smoothing, (2) Temporal Kernel Aggregation for compression, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention for low-cost correlation modeling.

Result: KAFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 7.2× fewer parameters and 8.4× faster training-inference.

Conclusion: Retaining CPA and optimizing its handling with KAFNet outperforms alternatives, offering efficiency and accuracy for IMTS forecasting.

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling
and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain
challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely
adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby
alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its
dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when
numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent
graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local
message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations.
Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series
properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art
graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a
compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1)
Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2)
Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of
intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the
low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain.
Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter
reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze and compare diffusion-based methods for inverse problems in imaging, identifying commonalities, trade-offs, and open challenges.

Method: Categorizes approaches into explicit approximations and others (variational inference, sequential Monte Carlo, decoupled data consistency), and reviews extensions for blind cases, high-dimensional data, and multimodal methods.

Result: Provides a structured overview of diffusion-based inverse problem solvers, clarifying assumptions, performance trade-offs, and open challenges.

Conclusion: The chapter distills mathematical connections, contrasts methods, and identifies unresolved theoretical and practical challenges in diffusion-based inverse problem solving.

Abstract: Using diffusion priors to solve inverse problems in imaging have
significantly matured over the years. In this chapter, we review the various
different approaches that were proposed over the years. We categorize the
approaches into the more classic explicit approximation approaches and others,
which include variational inference, sequential monte carlo, and decoupled data
consistency. We cover the extension to more challenging situations, including
blind cases, high-dimensional data, and problems under data scarcity and
distribution mismatch. More recent approaches that aim to leverage multimodal
information through texts are covered. Through this chapter, we aim to (i)
distill the common mathematical threads that connect these algorithms, (ii)
systematically contrast their assumptions and performance trade-offs across
representative inverse problems, and (iii) spotlight the open theoretical and
practical challenges by clarifying the landscape of diffusion model based
inverse problem solvers.

*Shutong Qiao,Wei Yuan,Junliang Yu,Tong Chen,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DLDA is a diffusion-based attack framework for recommender systems that balances strong adversarial promotion of target items with realistic fake user behavior to evade detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing shilling attack models fail to simultaneously achieve strong adversarial promotion and realistic behavior, leaving the true severity of such threats underappreciated.

Method: DLDA uses a conditional latent diffusion process in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding space to synthesize fake user profiles with precise target control, aided by dispersive regularization for realism.

Result: DLDA outperforms prior attacks in promoting target items while remaining harder to detect, as shown in experiments on three datasets and five RS models.

Conclusion: Modern recommender systems are more vulnerable to shilling attacks than previously thought, necessitating stronger defenses.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms,
but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to
shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users.
Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical
objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target
items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the
true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives
remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present
DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet
indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target
promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding
space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively
synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade
detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes
variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that,
compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion
while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are
more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for
more robust defenses.

*Hongze Sun,Wuque Cai,Duo Chen,Shifeng Mao,Jiayi He,Zhenxing Wang,Dezhong Yao,Daqing Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes lightweight spiking Transformer (ST) models by combining synapse pruning and synergistic learning, reducing parameters and computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ST-based models are resource-intensive, limiting deployment in constrained environments.

Method: Introduces unstructured L1P and structured DSP pruning strategies, along with a synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF) neuron for compensation.

Result: Significantly reduces model size and computational overhead without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies effectively create efficient and high-performing ST-based models.

Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer
has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance
across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models
require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs,
thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address
these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic
learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models.
Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce
redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured
$\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP
method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced
spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF)
neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic
learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining
competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and
high-performing ST-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance diverse advertiser goals and constraints in dynamic auto-bidding systems, overcoming limitations of generative methods like distribution shifts and action space exploration.

Method: GRAD combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse bidding actions and a Causal Transformer-based Value Estimator for constraint-aware optimization.

Result: GRAD increased Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) by 2.18% and ROI by 10.68% in real-world implementation at Meituan.

Conclusion: GRAD effectively addresses modern auto-bidding challenges, enhancing performance and advertiser satisfaction.

Abstract: Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with
diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and
evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative
models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory
generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative
to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative
methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between
offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and
the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return
on Investment (ROI). To tackle these challenges, we propose GRAD (Generative
Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model
for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse
bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for
constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments
demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its
effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern
advertisers. Furthermore, GRAD has been implemented in multiple marketing
scenarios at Meituan, one of the world's largest online food delivery
platforms, leading to a 2.18% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and
10.68% increase in ROI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method trains a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) to generate safety-critical scenarios for autonomous driving testing, improving efficiency and diversity without compromising fidelity or complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the generation of safety-critical scenarios in autonomous driving testing by leveraging cooperative adversarial driving characteristics between background vehicles (BVs).

Method: Uses MARL to train Dual-DM with non-adversarial and adversarial driving modalities, integrated into a continuous simulated traffic environment for evolving scenario generation.

Result: Dual-DM achieves high fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world scenarios), improved complexity (+32.35% and +12.5% over baselines), and significantly higher efficiency (+195%).

Conclusion: Dual-DM effectively enhances the generation of diverse and complex safety-critical scenarios, improving autonomous driving testing performance.

Abstract: In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the
construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers
of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in
generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative
adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient
generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper,
a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and
generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and
adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous
simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong
interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation
method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of
fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without
performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world
scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two
baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of
generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two
baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the
diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms
of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve
the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving
scenario generation method.

TL;DR: LLMs' reliability in qualitative coding is assessed using self-confidence and model diversity, achieving high accuracy and reducing manual effort by 65%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of assessing LLM reliability in qualitative coding where human experts often disagree.

Method: Analyzed 5,680 coding decisions from eight LLMs, using mean self-confidence and normalized Shannon entropy to measure inter-model agreement.

Result: A dual signal of confidence and diversity explains agreement almost completely (R^2=0.979), reducing manual effort by 65% with low error rates.

Conclusion: The study provides a generalizable, evidence-based criterion for calibrating AI judgment in qualitative research.

Abstract: LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing the reliability
of their output remains challenging in domains where human experts seldom
agree. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
ten thematic categories, we confirm that a model's mean self-confidence already
tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model
diversity-quantified as the normalised Shannon entropy of the panel's
votes-turns this single cue into a dual signal that explains agreement almost
completely (R^2=0.979). The confidence-diversity duo enables a three-tier
workflow that auto-accepts 35% of segments with <5% audit-detected error and
routes the remainder for targeted human review, cutting manual effort by up to
65%. Cross-domain replication on six public datasets spanning finance,
medicine, law and multilingual tasks confirms these gains (kappa improvements
of 0.20-0.78). Our results establish a generalisable, evidence-based criterion
for calibrating AI judgement in qualitative research.

TL;DR: A framework for source-free transfer learning reuses pre-trained models efficiently in white-box and black-box settings, enabling Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries for multi-source data-free supervised transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in source-free transfer learning due to data privacy concerns and unavailability of source data, which limits existing methods.

Method: Proposes a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient training, identifying subsets of related source models for reuse.

Result: Enables efficient transfer learning without source data, supporting MaaS providers in building pre-trained model libraries.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates multi-source data-free supervised transfer learning, overcoming practical limitations of source data unavailability.

Abstract: Increasing concerns for data privacy and other difficulties associated with
retrieving source data for model training have created the need for source-free
transfer learning, in which one only has access to pre-trained models instead
of data from the original source domains. This setting introduces many
challenges, as many existing transfer learning methods typically rely on access
to source data, which limits their direct applicability to scenarios where
source data is unavailable. Further, practical concerns make it more difficult,
for instance efficiently selecting models for transfer without information on
source data, and transferring without full access to the source models. So
motivated, we propose a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient
training of models that identifies subsets of related source models to reuse in
both white-box and black-box settings. Consequently, our framework makes it
possible for Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries of
efficient pre-trained models, thus creating an opportunity for multi-source
data-free supervised transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unexplored challenges of node unlearning in GNNs, avoiding retraining overhead while maintaining model utility.

Method: Proposes embedding reconstruction to reverse GNN aggregation and employs Range-Null Space Decomposition for node interaction learning.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles node unlearning in GNNs without retraining, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Graph unlearning is tailored for GNNs to handle widespread and various graph
structure unlearning requests, which remain largely unexplored. The GIF (graph
influence function) achieves validity under partial edge unlearning, but faces
challenges in dealing with more disturbing node unlearning. To avoid the
overhead of retraining and realize the model utility of unlearning, we proposed
a novel node unlearning method to reverse the process of aggregation in GNN by
embedding reconstruction and to adopt Range-Null Space Decomposition for the
nodes' interaction learning. Experimental results on multiple representative

TL;DR: Epi$^2$-Net, a physics-inspired neural network framework, improves epidemic forecasting by integrating physical constraints with neural modules, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current epidemic forecasting models (mechanism-based and data-driven) have limitations: mechanism-based models are too rigid, while data-driven models lack physical constraints, leading to biased results.

Method: Epi$^2$-Net redefines epidemic transmission from a physical transport perspective, introducing neural epidemic transport and integrating physical constraints with neural networks to model spatio-temporal dynamics.

Result: Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in real-world epidemic forecasting.

Conclusion: Epi$^2$-Net offers a promising solution for accurate epidemic forecasting by combining physical priors with neural representations.

Abstract: Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions
and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two
categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are
constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system
assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while
data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical
or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations.
Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge
into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical
priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce
Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired
Neural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic
transmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept
of neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep
learning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to
model spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world
datasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future
epidemic containment. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches for molecular reasoning lack domain-specific semantics, interpretability, and reasoning depth.

Method: 1. Mol-SFT: Uses GPT-4o-generated synthetic CoT samples for reasoning initialization. 2. Mol-RL: Applies reinforcement learning with chemical-aligned reward functions.

Result: MolReasoner improves interpretability, molecular understanding, and generalization, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MolReasoner shifts LLMs from memorization to robust chemical reasoning, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain
insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on
general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics,
while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with
interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce
MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from
memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which
initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT)
samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently,
Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions
designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions,
thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably
enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and
enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from
memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

TL;DR: A novel SNN architecture integrates graph structural learning and spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of SNNs in spatial modeling for multivariate time-series forecasting.

Method: The architecture includes embedding time features, an adaptive matrix, OBS Block for sequence learning, MSSA for multi-scale aggregation, and DSF Block for spatial-temporal fusion.

Result: The model surpasses iSpikformer and traditional temporal models, especially in long-sequence datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SNN architecture sets a new standard for efficient spatial-temporal modeling in time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of
biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities
of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate
time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly
integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for
multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time
features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph
structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation
(OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA)
hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers,
enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for
floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF)
Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a
spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking
self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence
datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art
SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal
models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient
spatial-temporal modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL) is a framework to prevent alignment drift in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs, using regularization and task-specific components, achieving up to 50% drift reduction without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minor LoRA updates can weaken safety and behavioral alignment in LLMs, necessitating a method to preserve alignment during fine-tuning.

Method: AGL combines primary task loss, Fisher Information Matrix-based regularization, task-specific regularization, and collision-aware regularization (Riemannian overlap and geodesic separation).

Result: AGL reduces alignment drift by up to 50% on safety benchmarks without degrading task performance, validated by the DriftCaps benchmark.

Conclusion: AGL effectively preserves alignment in LoRA fine-tuning, supported by empirical results and a derived scaling law for catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can
induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through
entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL),
a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL
introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher
Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in
alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize
the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware
regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise
interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update
geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and
unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.
Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on
safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.
Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to
preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling
law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning
loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally
grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal
trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source
our implementation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A mathematical framework for analyzing ML models via partition geometry, using Riemannian simplicial complexes and differential forms for tractable computations and geometric regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a geometric perspective for understanding and refining ML models by capturing spatial configurations and relationships in partitions.

Method: Represents partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, introduces differential forms for neural networks, and develops discrete curvature measures.

Result: Enables geometric regularization, model refinement tools, and new insights into learning dynamics through curvature measures.

Conclusion: The geometric framework offers novel approaches for model interpretation, regularization, and diagnostics.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing machine learning
  models through the geometry of their induced partitions. By representing
  partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, we capture not only adjacency
  relationships but also geometric properties including cell volumes, volumes
of
  faces where cells meet, and dihedral angles between adjacent cells. For
neural
  networks, we introduce a differential forms approach that tracks geometric
  structure through layers via pullback operations, making computations
  tractable by focusing on data-containing cells. The framework enables
  geometric regularization that directly penalizes problematic spatial
  configurations and provides new tools for model refinement through extended
  Laplacians and simplicial splines. We also explore how data distribution
  induces effective geometric curvature in model partitions, developing
discrete
  curvature measures for vertices that quantify local geometric complexity and
  statistical Ricci curvature for edges that captures pairwise relationships
  between cells. While focused on mathematical foundations, this geometric
  perspective offers new approaches to model interpretation, regularization,
and
  diagnostic tools for understanding learning dynamics.

Motivation: ANNS algorithms are crucial for AI applications like RAG and agent-based LLMs, but optimizing them manually is labor-intensive. CRINN aims to automate this process.

Method: CRINN treats ANNS optimization as a reinforcement learning problem, using execution speed as the reward signal to generate faster implementations.

Result: CRINN outperforms state-of-the-art ANNS algorithms on three benchmarks and ties on two others, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: CRINN's success shows that LLMs with reinforcement learning can automate complex algorithmic optimizations, extending beyond ANNS.

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become
increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

### [228] [Instance-Dependent Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning via Maximum Likelihood Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02103)
*Runze Zhao,Yue Yu,Ruhan Wang,Chunfeng Huang,Dongruo Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores instance-dependent behavior in continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL), introducing a model-based MLE algorithm that estimates state marginal density for adaptive learning. It provides regret bounds scaling with reward variance and measurement resolution, and proposes a randomized measurement schedule for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTRL's adaptability to varying problem difficulty is poorly understood. The work aims to address this gap by analyzing instance-dependent behavior and improving learning efficiency.

Method: A model-based algorithm using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator, focusing on state marginal density estimation instead of direct dynamics. Includes a randomized measurement schedule.

Result: The algorithm achieves regret bounds dependent on reward variance and measurement resolution, becoming independent of measurement strategy when observation frequency adapts to problem complexity.

Conclusion: The work advances CTRL by introducing adaptive learning behavior based on environmental difficulty, with potential for improved sample efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a natural framework
for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments where interactions
evolve continuously over time. While CTRL has shown growing empirical success,
its ability to adapt to varying levels of problem difficulty remains poorly
understood. In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of
CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing
approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the
state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent
performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total
reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes
independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency
adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve
performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that
enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost. These results
highlight a new direction for designing CTRL algorithms that automatically
adjust their learning behavior based on the underlying difficulty of the
environment.

### [229] [Real-Time Conflict Prediction for Large Truck Merging in Mixed Traffic at Work Zone Lane Closures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02109)
*Abyad Enan,Abdullah Al Mamun,Gurcan Comert,Debbie Aisiana Indah,Judith Mwakalonge,Amy W. Apon,Mashrur Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses an LSTM neural network to predict and reduce conflict risks for large trucks merging in work zones, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large trucks contribute significantly to work zone crashes due to their size and blind spots, necessitating safer merging strategies.

Method: An LSTM neural network predicts merging risks, ensuring safe gaps in the target lane for conflict-free merging.

Result: The LSTM method reduces conflict risk (lower TET and TIT values) and enables early merging without stopping, unlike baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The LSTM-based strategy enhances safety and efficiency for large truck merging in work zones compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily
due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large
trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures
caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of
large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated
with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging
based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into
a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is
critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a
minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free
merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in
response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is
compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based
merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based
merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower
conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and
Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can
perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete
stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly
observed with the baseline approaches.

*Ju Chen,Jun Feng,Shenyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PTBCC introduces prototype learning to improve annotator expertise estimation in multi-class classification, addressing data sparsity and class imbalance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing confusion-matrix-based methods fail in sparse or imbalanced data, and lack flexibility in capturing annotator expertise.

Method: PTBCC uses prototype confusion matrices and Dirichlet priors to model annotator expertise, enhancing reliability and flexibility.

Result: PTBCC improves accuracy by up to 15% and reduces computational cost by over 90% in experiments on 11 datasets.

Conclusion: PTBCC offers a robust, efficient solution for truth inference in noisy annotation scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-class classification annotations have significantly advanced AI
applications, with truth inference serving as a critical technique for
aggregating noisy and biased annotations. Existing state-of-the-art methods
typically model each annotator's expertise using a confusion matrix. However,
these methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators
label only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion
matrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains
inadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all
tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based
method, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to
introduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning.
Specifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion
matrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators.
Rather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended
as a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype
learning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance
issues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators.
Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves
up to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average
accuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.

TL;DR: The paper explores how architectural choices in deep networks impact learning dynamics, introducing enriched transformation layers to improve training stability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how internal structural choices influence learning behavior, moving beyond empirical tweaks to principled design.

Method: Introduces enriched transformation layers with constrained pathways and adaptive corrections, analyzing their effects on gradient flow and spectral sensitivity.

Result: Demonstrates improved robustness, smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior in synthetic and structured tasks.

Conclusion: Architectural design is key to shaping learning dynamics, offering interpretable and scalable solutions for neural systems.

Abstract: While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their
training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical
tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal
structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior
efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the
broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and
adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers
that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how
these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point
behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and
representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical
studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness,
smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing
fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer
learning behavior in interpretable ways. Our findings support a growing view
that architectural design is not merely a matter of performance tuning, but a
critical axis for shaping learning dynamics in scalable and trustworthy neural
systems.

TL;DR: Amber Pruner is a training-free N:M activation sparsity method for LLMs, improving efficiency without retraining. Combined with quantization, it maintains performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of weight and activation sparsity in LLMs, such as accuracy loss and training dependency.

Method: Introduces Amber Pruner for N:M activation sparsity in the prefill stage and integrates it with W8A8 quantization in Outstanding-sparse.

Result: Sparsifies and accelerates >55% of linear computations, preserving performance in downstream tasks, especially generative ones.

Conclusion: Pioneers activation sparsity for LLMs, guiding future AI system design with efficient, training-free methods.

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a
structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While
prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from
significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is
typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address
these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation
sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the
acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber
Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear
computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality
and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that
integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach
preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable
advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation
sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the
co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation
AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines how extreme weather events (frost, drought, extreme rainfall, heatwave) impact kiwifruit yields in New Zealand using Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, revealing variability in effects and limitations in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change has increased extreme weather events, posing challenges to agriculture, particularly kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.

Method: Isolation Forest, an unsupervised anomaly detection method, was used to analyze climate history, extreme events, and kiwifruit yields.

Result: The study found variability in how extreme events affect yields and identified limitations in detecting events like frost.

Conclusion: Future work will use ensemble methods to improve detection accuracy and integrate farm management strategies for better climate adaptation.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry
worldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.
We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events,
specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit
harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant
impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate
monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an
unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded
extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals
considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect
kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes
and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights
critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in
accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need
for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with
climate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble
methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station
features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of
extreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies.

*Qi Xiong,Hai Dong,Nasrin Sohrabi,Zahir Tari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLAD is a novel linear algebra-based method to detect and mitigate Sybil attacks in federated learning, outperforming existing defenses like Sherpa and Krum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sybil attacks, especially targeted data poisoning, threaten federated learning by allowing malicious nodes to dominate. Current methods fail when malicious nodes are in the majority.

Method: FedLAD models the aggregation process as a linear algebra problem, identifying attacks by extracting independent linear combinations and filtering malicious elements.

Result: FedLAD outperforms five baseline methods, maintaining low attack success rates (0.2-0.8 malicious ratio) and high model accuracy (0.2-0.5 ratio).

Conclusion: FedLAD enhances federated learning security and performance, proving robust across diverse tasks and malicious node ratios.

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to federated learning, as malicious
nodes can collaborate and gain a majority, thereby overwhelming the system.
Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures that ensure the security
of federated learning environments. We present a novel defence method against
targeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called
Linear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as
clustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious
nodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a
linear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.
This method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear
combinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out
redundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established
defence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks
from both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments
confirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application
settings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated
learning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to
baseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for
malicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it
preserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and
0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the
reliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data
poisoning attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over 96% of human proteins are undrugged, and current methods lack precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting therapeutic discovery.

Method: AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness.

Result: AuroBind outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieves 100,000-fold faster screening, and identifies potent compounds with hit rates of 7-69% in experimental screens.

Conclusion: AuroBind bridges the gap between structure prediction and therapeutic discovery, offering a generalizable framework for high-throughput molecular screening.

Abstract: Most human proteins remain undrugged, over 96% of human proteins remain
unexploited by approved therapeutics. While structure-based virtual screening
promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level
precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact.
We present AuroBind, a scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes a
custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data.
AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from
high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to
jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed
models outperform state-of-the-art models on structural and functional
benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large
compound libraries. In a prospective screen across ten disease-relevant
targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates of 7-69%, with top compounds
reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. For the orphan GPCRs GPR151 and
GPR160, AuroBind identified both agonists and antagonists with success rates of
16-30%, and functional assays confirmed GPR160 modulation in liver and prostate
cancer models. AuroBind offers a generalizable framework for structure-function
learning and high-throughput molecular screening, bridging the gap between
structure prediction and therapeutic discovery.

TL;DR: A robust knowledge distillation framework (RKD-SC) is proposed to enable efficient and noise-resistant semantic communication using large-scale models, addressing computational complexity and channel noise challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct deployment of large-scale models (LSMs) in semantic communication is hindered by high computational complexity and resource demands, necessitating a more efficient and robust solution.

Method: The framework includes a knowledge distillation-based lightweight architecture search (KDL-DARTS) and a two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm, enhanced by a channel-aware transformer (CAT) block for noise resilience.

Result: Simulations show RKD-SC reduces model parameters while maintaining performance and outperforming existing methods in robustness.

Conclusion: RKD-SC effectively addresses the challenges of LSMs in semantic communication, offering a lightweight, robust, and efficient solution.

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic
representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for
designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment
is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements.
In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic
communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and
\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM
(teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system
robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a
channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec,
trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs.
Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC
framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree
of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared
to existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of partial observability in safe reinforcement learning by utilizing privileged information.

Method: Proposes ACPOMDPs and a model-based approach with privileged representation alignment and asymmetric actor-critic structure.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in safety and performance, with easier training compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances RL safety and performance using privileged information.

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement
learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards.
Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate
the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes.
In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of
incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the
Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement
learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's
safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an
asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and
task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged
model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior
performance and ease of training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A trajectory prediction model combining MLP, MSCNN, and cross-attention reduces forecasting errors while maintaining acceptable inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in extracting global and local temporal patterns from trajectory data and capturing multi-scale user behavior.

Method: Uses MLP for global temporal information, MSCNN with varying kernel sizes for local temporal information, and cross-attention to fuse both.

Result: Reduces MSE by 5.04% and MAE by 4.35% compared to ModernTCN in 12-step prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively improves trajectory prediction accuracy without compromising inference speed.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that
anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to
reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable
inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data
contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the
extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs
over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral
patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on
multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN),
and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the
global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to
extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features
within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are
used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions,
enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally,
CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental
results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean
absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction,
while maintaining similar inference time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Treatment-DML, a framework for optimizing continuous, multi-dimensional loan treatments (e.g., credit limits, interest rates) using Double Machine Learning (DML) to address biases in observational data and enforce domain-specific monotonic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal methods are limited to binary/discrete treatments and fail in continuous, multi-dimensional settings, while financial domain knowledge requires provably monotonic treatment-outcome relationships.

Method: The proposed Multi-Treatment-DML leverages DML to debias observational data, handle continuous treatments, and enforce monotonic constraints.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks and real-world datasets show the framework's effectiveness, and online A/B testing confirms its practical superiority in loan operations.

Conclusion: Multi-Treatment-DML successfully addresses gaps in causal estimation for continuous, multi-dimensional treatments in personal loan platforms, proving its real-world applicability.

Abstract: Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for
managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform.
However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional
treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited
by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased
observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete
treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings.
Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic
treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To
address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework
leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for
causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous
treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and
outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments
on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a
realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of
Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.

TL;DR: Proposes a context-aware adaptive decoding method for improving truthfulness in LLMs, requiring minimal annotated data and no retraining, outperforming baselines on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of truthfulness in LLMs without costly retraining or extensive annotations.

Method: Uses a compact reference grounding space from few examples to shape logits during inference via retrieval and aggregation.

Result: Achieves 2.8% improvement on TruthfulQA and outperforms baselines on Biographies and WikiQA, showing cross-task generalization.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs, offering a scalable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Ensuring truthfulness in large language models remains a critical challenge
for reliable text generation. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial
amount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In
contrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without
model retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like
prompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model
states. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a
compact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples
and comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful
responses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each
decoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and
aggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits.
Across three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a
2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing
baselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate
cross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing
biography generation. Our model-agnostic, scalable, and efficient method
requires only a single generation pass, highlighting the potential of
context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs.

TL;DR: A networked LLM system with specialized models improves accuracy and timeliness by aggregating responses, outperforming individual LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of large LLMs (data, resources, energy) by leveraging smaller, specialized models.

Method: Use a networked system with users, a task processor, and topic-specialized LLM clusters to route and aggregate binary queries.

Result: Aggregated responses achieve higher accuracy, especially when LLMs have similar standalone performance.

Conclusion: Specialized LLM clusters offer a practical, efficient alternative to large LLMs, balancing accuracy and timeliness.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many
fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text
mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for
training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant
challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to
leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to
improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM
system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of
topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false)
queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$
LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final
aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy
and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization
problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations
demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy
than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant
when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.

Result: Achieves up to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction, with a 1.3x speedup in attention computation.

Conclusion: LeanK effectively optimizes LLM efficiency, offering insights into model channels and attention heads during long-context inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency
challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a
learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by
leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process,
LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity
ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and
accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up
to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel
enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into
model channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing
the learned importance distribution. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CellForge is an AI-driven multi-agent system that autonomously builds optimized computational models for virtual cells from raw single-cell multi-omics data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of biological systems and the need for multi-disciplinary expertise make autonomous virtual cell modeling challenging.

Method: CellForge uses a multi-agent framework with three modules: Task Analysis, Method Design (with specialized agents and a moderator), and Experiment Execution.

Result: CellForge outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell perturbation prediction across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing perspectives yields better solutions for virtual cell modeling.

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as
responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously
building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the
complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the
need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we
introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework
that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly
into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given
only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge
outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training
virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:
Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature
retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop
optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated
generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts
with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to
collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.
We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,
using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and
cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently
outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge
demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing
perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling
challenge. Our code is publicly available at

### [244] [Multi-Policy Pareto Front Tracking Based Online and Offline Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02217)
*Zeyu Zhao,Yueling Che,Kaichen Liu,Jian Li,Junmei Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking (MPFT) framework for MORL, improving efficiency by avoiding evolutionary methods and combining online/offline learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-policy MORL methods are sample-inefficient and computationally heavy due to reliance on evolutionary frameworks and large policy populations.

Method: The MPFT framework involves four stages: approximating Pareto-vertex policies, Pareto front tracking, filling sparse regions, and combining policies for Pareto front approximation.

Result: MPFT outperforms benchmarks in hypervolume performance with reduced interactions and hardware needs, tested on robotic control tasks.

Conclusion: MPFT offers a more efficient and scalable solution for MORL by eliminating evolutionary frameworks and leveraging both online and offline learning.

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in
addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The
multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto
front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only
rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary
framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency
and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the
evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking
(MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online
and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework
includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies,
whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front.
Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front,
starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse
regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight
adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the
policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front.
Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control
tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the
superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment
interactions and hardware requirements.

### [245] [Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner: An Efficient Neural Network Pruning Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02291)
*Chenqing Lin,Mostafa Hussien,Chengyao Yu,Mohamed Cheriet,Osama Abdelrahman,Ruixing Ming*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAIR-Pruner is a novel structured pruning method for neural networks, using Wasserstein distance and Taylor expansion to identify and remove insignificant units, achieving efficient compression without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable deployment of large neural networks on edge devices by reducing computational and memory overhead through pruning.

Method: FAIR-Pruner evaluates unit importance via Wasserstein distance (Utilization Score), computes Reconstruction Error via Taylor expansion, and uses Tolerance of Difference to identify superfluous units. It automatically determines layer-wise pruning rates.

Result: Achieves significant model compression while maintaining high accuracy on benchmarks like ImageNet and architectures like VGG, without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: FAIR-Pruner is effective for structured pruning, offering flexibility and efficiency in model compression.

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates
the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant
parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the
Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for
neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates
the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization
Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance
degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,
which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,
FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model
performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures
differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance
degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to
automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more
efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.
Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without
post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and
reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different
pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark
datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG)
demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while
maintaining high accuracy.

### [246] [Pigeon-SL: Robust Split Learning Framework for Edge Intelligence under Malicious Clients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02235)
*Sangjun Park,Tony Q. S. Quek,Hyowoon Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pigeon-SL is a novel split learning scheme that ensures robustness against malicious clients by partitioning them into clusters, training independently, and selecting the most honest cluster based on validation loss. Pigeon-SL+ further enhances efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split learning (SL) is vulnerable to malicious clients, which degrade model accuracy. Pigeon-SL aims to address this by isolating adversarial updates.

Method: Clients are partitioned into N+1 clusters, trained independently via SL, and evaluated on shared validation loss. The best-performing cluster advances, discarding malicious updates. Pigeon-SL+ repeats training on the selected cluster for efficiency.

Result: Pigeon-SL shows significant improvements in accuracy and resilience under label flipping, activation, and gradient manipulation attacks compared to baseline SL.

Conclusion: Pigeon-SL and Pigeon-SL+ provide robust, efficient solutions for secure split learning in wireless networks, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising
framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient distributed learning
at the network edge. However, SL's sequential update process is vulnerable to
even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy.
To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the
pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among
M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the
access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster
independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared
dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and
discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication
efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to
match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label
flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant
improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future
intelligent wireless networks.

### [247] [CAPO: Towards Enhancing LLM Reasoning through Verifiable Generative Credit Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02298)
*Guofu Xie,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Ting Yao,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAPO introduces fine-grained credit assignment in RLVR by using an LLM-as-GenPRM for step-wise critiques, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods lack precise credit assignment, leading to suboptimal policies. CAPO addresses this by providing verifiable token-level rewards.

Method: CAPO uses an LLM-as-GenPRM to generate step-wise critiques in one pass, enabling fine-grained credit assignment. A voting mechanism enhances robustness.

Result: CAPO outperforms supervised and RL-based methods on six math and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: CAPO improves RLVR by enabling efficient, verifiable, and fine-grained credit assignment, enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary
feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods
typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to
every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,
making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or
failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.
Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often
yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other
hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments
for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision
labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning
(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method
Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response
rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,
general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to
generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable
token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned
identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment
in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated
critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen
models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms
supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six
challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

*Tiantian Liu,Xiao Li,Huan Li,Hua Lu,Christian S. Jensen,Jianliang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning-based framework for shortest path search on generic graphs, using a skeleton graph and neural network to improve efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (Dijkstra's, A*, index-based, or learning-based) are inefficient, storage-heavy, or lack general applicability.

Method: Constructs a skeleton graph for multi-level distance/hop info, trains a Skeleton Graph Neural Network (SGNN) for embeddings, and uses guided search (LSearch/HLSearch) with pruning.

Result: Achieves strong performance on diverse real-world graphs, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: Proposes a flexible, effective solution for learning-based shortest path search without domain-specific features.

Abstract: Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet
existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as
Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while
index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage.
Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on
context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general
applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest
path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At
the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures
multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph
Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and
predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support
LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the
search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a
hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with
individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of
our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on
five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong
performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for
learning-based shortest path search.

*Wenyuan Liu,Haoqian Meng,Yilun Luo,Peng Zhang,Xindian Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MicroMix is a mixed-precision quantization algorithm and kernel for LLMs, optimized for NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture, improving speed and accuracy over INT4 and FP8 methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INT4-based kernels don't fully utilize the FP4 capabilities of Blackwell architecture, limiting performance gains.

Method: Proposes MicroMix, combining MXFP4/6/8 formats with BFloat16 outputs, using quantization thresholds to balance accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Achieves 20% faster execution than TensorRT-FP8, improves prefill latency, and maintains accuracy across tasks.

Conclusion: MicroMix effectively bridges the gap in exploiting Blackwell's FP4 capabilities, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models
(LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision
counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily
focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although
the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x
speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this
capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose
MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix
multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the
Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of
MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a
favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we
introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where
lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.
Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve
accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or
superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and
few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical
reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX
5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than
TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,
MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a
range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at
https://github.com/lwy2020/MicroMix.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel multistage focal loss function improves machine learning performance in imbalanced insurance fraud prediction by dynamically adjusting focus on hard-to-classify samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing class imbalance in insurance fraud prediction to enhance model performance and robustness.

Method: Proposes a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex focal loss mechanism to refine focus on hard samples across training epochs.

Result: Outperforms traditional focal loss in accuracy, precision, F1-score, recall, and AUC on a real-world auto insurance dataset.

Conclusion: The multistage focal loss enhances model robustness and predictive accuracy in skewed classification, with implications for fraud detection systems.

Abstract: In insurance fraud prediction, handling class imbalance remains a critical
challenge. This paper presents a novel multistage focal loss function designed
to enhance the performance of machine learning models in such imbalanced
settings by helping to escape local minima and converge to a good solution.
Building upon the foundation of the standard focal loss, our proposed approach
introduces a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism that
progressively adjusts the focus on hard-to-classify samples across training
epochs. This strategic refinement facilitates more stable learning and improved
discrimination between fraudulent and legitimate cases. Through extensive
experimentation on a real-world insurance dataset, our method achieved better
performance than the traditional focal loss, as measured by accuracy,
precision, F1-score, recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics on the auto
insurance dataset. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multistage
focal loss in boosting model robustness and predictive accuracy in highly
skewed classification tasks, offering significant implications for fraud
detection systems in the insurance industry. An explainable model is included
to interpret the results.

*Valeria Ruscio,Umberto Nanni,Fabrizio Silvestri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Attention sink (AS) in transformers is a fundamental geometric principle for establishing reference frames in high-dimensional spaces, not just an artifact. Three reference frame types (centralized, distributed, bidirectional) emerge early in training, influenced by architecture components like position encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the attention sink phenomenon in transformers and its underlying geometric principles, revealing how reference frames stabilize high-dimensional spaces.

Method: Analyzed transformer architectures, identified three reference frame types, and studied their emergence during training. Examined the role of position encoding in shaping these frames.

Result: Attention sink is tied to reference frames, which emerge early in training. Position encoding implementations influence the type of reference frame (centralized, distributed, bidirectional).

Conclusion: The study redefines transformer attention mechanisms, linking AS to geometric principles, and offers insights for architecture design and understanding AS.

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps
where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors)
disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in
transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation
of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames
that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and
identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and
bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that
they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the
problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces.
We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position
encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This
perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms
and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with
AS.

*Javier Fumanal-Idocin,Raquel Fernandez-Peralta,Javier Andreu-Perez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rule-based dynamic feature selection (DFS) method, enhancing interpretability and computational efficiency compared to opaque models like neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DFS methods lack transparency, limiting their use in critical applications like clinical decisions. This work aims to improve interpretability.

Method: The approach uses a rule-based system for DFS, providing interpretable decisions, uncertainty measures, and computational efficiency by constraining feature search.

Result: The method shows competitive performance against opaque state-of-the-art methods like greedy and RL approaches.

Conclusion: Rule-based DFS offers a transparent, efficient alternative to traditional opaque models, suitable for scenarios requiring decision interpretability.

Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to
traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each
individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set,
DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the
decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in
settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however,
existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in
real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a
rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances
decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this
method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query
and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by
constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of
conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that
minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally,
we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach
against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are
mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.

TL;DR: The paper explores using synthetic data to train machine learning models for aviation predictions, showing it retains 94-97% of real-data performance while preserving confidentiality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Restricted access to real aviation data hinders predictive model development, prompting the need for synthetic alternatives.

Method: Evaluated four synthetic data generators on three tasks using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) approach with 1.7M flight records.

Result: Transformer-based generators achieved 94-97% of real-data performance and preserved operational relationships.

Conclusion: High-quality synthetic data can enable aviation analytics while protecting confidentiality, though pre-tactical prediction accuracy remains limited by stochastic operations.

Abstract: Access to comprehensive flight operations data remains severely restricted in
aviation due to commercial sensitivity and competitive considerations,
hindering the development of predictive models for operational planning. This
paper investigates whether synthetic data can effectively replace real
operational data for training machine learning models in pre-tactical aviation
scenarios-predictions made hours to days before operations using only scheduled
flight information. We evaluate four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators
on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and
arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on
over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data
quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance
and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that
advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based
generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while
maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational
decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction
accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is
available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These
findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to
aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality,
though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical
prediction accuracy given the stochastic nature of flight operations.

Motivation: Existing PEFT strategies do not leverage MoE's dynamic routing, prompting investigation into whether adaptation modules should incorporate routing to align with MoE's architecture.

Method: Analyzes core components when applying PEFT to MoE models and examines routing strategies' impact on adaptation. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B validate the approach.

Result: Identifies optimal configurations for different scenarios, demonstrating performance and efficiency gains with routed PEFT.

Conclusion: Provides empirical insights to improve PEFT and MoE applications, emphasizing the benefits of routing mechanisms in adaptation.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) benefits from a dynamic routing mechanism among
their specialized experts, which existing Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategies fail to leverage. This motivates us to investigate whether
adaptation modules themselves should incorporate routing mechanisms to align
with MoE's multi-expert architecture. We analyze dynamics of core components
when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing
strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting
OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks
validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the
optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses
with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

*Siyi Liu,Yujia Zheng,Yongqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StructSynth integrates LLMs with structural control to generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data, outperforming existing methods in low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in specialized domains limits machine learning applications. Traditional generative models and LLMs fail to preserve tabular data structure, leading to low-quality synthetics.

Method: StructSynth uses a two-stage approach: (1) learns a DAG for structure discovery, (2) uses this structure to guide LLM generation, ensuring adherence to feature dependencies.

Result: StructSynth generates synthetic data with higher structural integrity and utility, excelling in low-data scenarios and balancing privacy with fidelity.

Conclusion: StructSynth effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering a robust solution for generating structured synthetic data.

Abstract: The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is
severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution,
traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data,
leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce
StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs
with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture.
First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a
high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to
adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated
data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher
structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It
proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully
navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.

*Boran Zhao,Haiduo Huang,Qiwei Dang,Wenzhe Zhao,Tian Xia,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm (DE-SNE) and near-memory computing (NMS) to reduce energy and improve generalization in edge device DNN training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing energy consumption and generalization issues in DNN training on edge devices caused by dataset compression methods.

Method: Introduces DE-SNE for DNN-free sample selection and NMS for near-memory computing to minimize DDR energy.

Result: NMS outperforms SOTA methods (DQ, DQAS, NeSSA) in model accuracy.

Conclusion: NMS effectively reduces energy and improves generalization, making DNN training on edge devices more practical.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing
attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain
adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large
datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making
the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have
been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and
dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating
representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two
significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate
the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive
bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training
images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,
leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by
the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a
DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the
generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory
computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images
need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR
energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system
with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge
devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free
near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization
issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The
experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art

TL;DR: The paper introduces TransRA, a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding model, to integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models, overcoming initial challenges with significant performance improvements in CTR and CVR predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage offsite conversion data and explore connections between onsite and offsite user activities for better Ads ranking models.

Method: Constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph from user activities and introduced TransRA, along with Large ID Embedding Table and attention-based KGE finetuning.

Result: Achieved significant AUC lift in CTR and CVR predictions, with a 2.69% CTR lift and 1.34% CPC reduction in deployment.

Conclusion: The techniques can benefit other large-scale industrial models, demonstrating practical impact.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry
recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage},
TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were
constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph
models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to
users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models
to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data
and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we
constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad
interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we
introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads
ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly
incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were
observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the
Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE
finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a
significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR)
prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's
Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC
reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged
by other large-scale industrial models.

### [258] [A Compression Based Classification Framework Using Symbolic Dynamics of Chaotic Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02330)
*Parth Naik,Harikrishnan N B*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel classification framework, ChaosComp, uses symbolic dynamics and chaotic maps to model classes, achieving competitive performance on datasets like Breast Cancer Wisconsin and Iris.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reinterpret classification through dynamical systems and compression, foundational perspectives in learning theory.

Method: Symbolic sequences from thresholded data are evolved via chaotic maps; transition probabilities form class-specific models. Testing involves symbolic encoding and shortest compressed representation determines the class.

Result: Competitive performance (e.g., macro F1-scores: Breast Cancer Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317).

Conclusion: The framework successfully merges dynamical systems, symbolic representations, and compression-based learning, offering a fresh perspective on classification.

Abstract: We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and
data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by
generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which
are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we
compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01',
`10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to
form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data
are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic
statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The
predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed
representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its
respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems,
symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the
proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning
algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer
Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317 etc.). Rather than aiming for
state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the
classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression,
which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information
processing.

TL;DR: AutoML-Med is an Automated Machine Learning tool designed to tackle common medical dataset challenges like missing values and class imbalance, achieving better accuracy and sensitivity than existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical datasets often have issues like missing values and class imbalance, hindering ML model performance. AutoML-Med aims to address these challenges with minimal user intervention.

Method: AutoML-Med uses Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for preprocessing exploration, trains models with selected metrics, and employs Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for optimization.

Result: AutoML-Med outperforms state-of-the-art tools in clinical settings, achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity.

Conclusion: AutoML-Med shows promise for improving ML applications in healthcare, especially for sparse and imbalanced medical datasets.

Abstract: Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values,
class imbalance, a heterogeneous feature types, and a high number of features
versus a relatively small number of samples, preventing machine learning models
from obtaining proper results in classification and regression tasks. This
paper introduces AutoML-Med, an Automated Machine Learning tool specifically
designed to address these challenges, minimizing user intervention and
identifying the optimal combination of preprocessing techniques and predictive
models. AutoML-Med's architecture incorporates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and
utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned
optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results
demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings,
achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for
identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools.
AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical
datasets with sparse data and class imbalance, highlights its potential to
streamline Machine Learning applications in healthcare.

*Joon-Hyun Park,Mujin Cheon,Dong-Yeun Koh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BOOST automates the selection of optimal kernel and acquisition function pairs in Bayesian optimization, improving performance over manual or heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO) heavily depends on hyperparameter selection, but joint and autonomous selection of kernel and acquisition functions has been overlooked, leading to inefficiency.

Method: BOOST uses an offline evaluation stage to test kernel-acquisition pairs on partitioned data, selecting the best configuration based on retrospective performance.

Result: BOOST outperforms standard BO with fixed hyperparameters in synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: BOOST is a robust and effective solution for automating hyperparameter selection in BO.

Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient
method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the
selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition
functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can
lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements
to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and
acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have
been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these
fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to
rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective
framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition
Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a
lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various
kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration
before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a
reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible
kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each
configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset,
evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in
the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best
retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both
synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks
demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with
fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse
problem landscapes.

*Väinö Yrjänäinen,Isac Boström,Måns Magnusson,Johan Jonasson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes scalable methods (Gibbs sampler with Polya-Gamma augmentation and Laplace approximation) for quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings, outperforming existing Bayesian methods like HMC and MFVI in accuracy and feasibility for large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bayesian methods for uncertainty quantification in word embeddings (HMC, MFVI) are either computationally expensive or rely on restrictive assumptions, limiting their practicality for large datasets.

Method: The authors introduce a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation and Laplace approximation, comparing them with MFVI and HMC. They also address non-identifiability in word embeddings.

Result: The Gibbs sampler and HMC accurately estimate uncertainties, while MFVI fails, and Laplace approximation works only for large samples. The Gibbs sampler is demonstrated on real datasets (US Congress, Movielens) and shows improved performance over MAP estimates.

Conclusion: Posterior sampling (e.g., via Gibbs sampler) is essential for reliable uncertainty quantification in word embeddings, especially for smaller datasets, as it outperforms MAP estimates in predictive performance.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings is crucial for reliable inference
from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either
computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions.
  We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as
Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings.
In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs
sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and
Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying
the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate
the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from
the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves
over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood,
especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for
posterior sampling of word embeddings.

### [262] [A Novel Sliced Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02364)
*Moritz Piening,Robert Beinert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel slicing technique for Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) and fused GW (FGW) distances is proposed, reducing computational effort while preserving isometric invariance and enabling comparison of arbitrary geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational challenge and limitations of existing sliced GW methods, such as Euclidean restriction and loss of isometric invariance, motivate the development of a more versatile and efficient approach.

Method: The method leverages a lower bound, hierarchical optimal transport (OT), and quadrature rules for 1D OT problems to create a sliced version of GW and FGW.

Result: The new sliced FGW is computationally efficient, isometric-invariant, and applicable to arbitrary geometries, outperforming original GW and FGW in robustness and reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed sliced distance acts as a pseudo-metric, bounds FGW from below, and offers improved performance in tasks like shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are
powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however,
challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal
transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been
proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version
is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries,
strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an
appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the
underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the
numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and
allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance
actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from
below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW.
Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is
numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance;
especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

*Adam Darmanin,Vince Vella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid system combining LLMs and RL improves algorithmic trading by addressing myopic behavior and lack of transparency in RL alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL's limitations in long-term alignment and policy transparency hinder its adoption in algorithmic trading. LLMs offer strategic reasoning and signal interpretation.

Method: LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents. Evaluated via expert review and financial metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown).

Result: LLM-guided agents outperform standard RL in return and risk metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown).

Conclusion: The hybrid LLM-RL approach enhances algorithmic trading by leveraging LLMs' strategic reasoning and RL's tactical execution.

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term
financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such
tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque
policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal
interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies
to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of
LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and
Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results
show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

### [264] [Beyond Manually Designed Pruning Policies with Second-Level Performance Prediction: A Pruning Framework for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02381)
*Zuxin Ma,Yunhe Cui,Yongbin Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPF is a novel pruning framework for LLMs that uses second-level performance prediction to automate pruning decisions, outperforming manual methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing non-uniform pruning methods rely on manual policies and are inefficient for dynamic pruning scenarios, with slow evaluation times.

Method: PPF employs an agent for real-time pruning actions and a lightweight predictor for fast policy evaluation, enabling dynamic and static pruning.

Result: PPF reduces perplexity by up to 33.4% (dynamic) and 84.78% (static), with prediction error < 0.0011 and 64x speedup in evaluation.

Conclusion: PPF automates and accelerates pruning, outperforming manual methods and adapting to dynamic requirements.

Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large
Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering
lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing
non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,
layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt
to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical
bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further
limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning
policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning
Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design
dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports
real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable
to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and
real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can
evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative
optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can
generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to
33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,
outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor
achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction
error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1
minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52
second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at

*Changjie Sheng,Zhichao Zhang,Wei Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEFRFE, a spectral graph embedding method using fractional Fourier transform to enhance feature capture and classification performance while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spectral embedding methods lack expressiveness in capturing latent structural features across transform domains.

Method: Extends GEFFE into fractional domains using graph fractional Fourier transform, incorporating filtering and nonlinear eigenvector composition. Introduces search-based optimization and ResNet18-based learning for fractional order determination.

Result: GEFRFE captures richer structural features and improves classification performance on six benchmark datasets, with comparable computational complexity to GEFFE.

Conclusion: GEFRFE effectively enhances spectral graph embedding by leveraging fractional domains, offering improved performance without added computational cost.

Abstract: Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation
learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph
spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral
embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively
capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To
address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the
existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE)
into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering
embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph
fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a
nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized
graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel
strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based
adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance
classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational
complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural
networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust
loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,
particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the
underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric
condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the
softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error
$\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for
the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the
loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve
noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss
function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly
reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one
symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and
effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is
available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASMR is a novel method for detecting and excluding malfunctioning clients in Federated Learning without needing hyperparameters or prior knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defense mechanisms in FL require impractical prerequisites, making them unsuitable for real-world applications. ASMR addresses this by dynamically excluding malfunctioning clients.

Method: ASMR uses angular distance to dynamically exclude malfunctioning clients, requiring no hyperparameters or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients.

Result: Experiments on a histopathological dataset demonstrate ASMR's effectiveness in detecting malfunctioning clients and adapting decision boundaries.

Conclusion: ASMR provides a practical and effective solution for improving FL robustness against malfunctioning clients.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a
distributed and privacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from
malfunctioning updates sent by the attending clients that cause global model
performance degradation. Reasons for this malfunctioning might be technical
issues, disadvantageous training data, or malicious attacks. Most of the
current defense mechanisms are meant to require impractical prerequisites like
knowledge about the number of malfunctioning updates, which makes them
unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these problems, we
introduce a novel method called Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client
Resilience (ASMR), that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on
their angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters
or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments
showcase the detection capabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on
a histopathological dataset, while also presenting findings on the significance
of dynamically adapting decision boundaries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using classical ML and PointNet to evaluate the quality of 3D liver shapes generated by diffusion models, offering interpretable and complementary insights to expert reviews.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the quality of 3D medical shapes generated by models like diffusion models is challenging due to the lack of ground truth and reliance on labor-intensive expert reviews.

Method: Point clouds are sampled from generated liver shapes, handcrafted geometric features are extracted, and supervised ML/PointNet models are trained to classify shapes as good or bad. These models then act as proxy discriminators.

Result: ML-based classifiers provide interpretable feedback and insights complementary to expert evaluation, suggesting their utility as lightweight quality metrics.

Conclusion: ML classifiers can serve as effective, interpretable tools for evaluating synthetic 3D organ shapes, enhancing transparency and clinical alignment in medical shape modeling.

Abstract: While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown
promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the
absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing
evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training
and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the
individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert
review.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML)
methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing
the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces
of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and
train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as
good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to
assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.
  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only
interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert
evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight,
task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more
transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape
modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework for Federated Graph Learning addresses selective and complete data removal, improving accuracy and unlearning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust data removal mechanisms in decentralized systems to comply with privacy rights like the right to be forgotten.

Method: Bifurcated strategy: fine-grained Meta Unlearning with prototype gradients and adversarial graphs for selective removal; adversarial graphs for complete client unlearning.

Result: Improved model prediction accuracy in both client and meta-unlearning scenarios, validated on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses unlearning challenges and enhances existing methods as a plug-in module.

Abstract: The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like
Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training.
However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the
right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two
distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and
their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a
user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully
address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data
removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work
introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution
to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy
tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,
it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,
which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any
remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client
unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to
purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The
framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across
both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where
it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness
of other established methods.

*Kunyu Zhang,Lin Gu,Liangchen Liu,Yingke Chen,Bingyang Wang,Jin Yan,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses label noise in medical image datasets caused by expert uncertainty in clinical notes, proposing a benchmark and label smoothing method to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore expert-driven uncertainty in clinical notes, leading to noisy labels in medical image datasets.

Method: The study examines the impact of expert uncertainty on label noise and introduces a clinical expert uncertainty-aware benchmark with a label smoothing method.

Result: The proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Incorporating expert-written uncertainty into medical image analysis improves label quality and model performance.

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical
notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,
these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the
clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to
make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or
``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these
nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for
handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the
problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important
issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better
incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image
analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of
clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert
uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which
significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art
approaches.

Motivation: To improve neural methods' performance in combinatorial optimization by learning from structured problem distributions.

Method: Generates large base problem instances and samples training/test instances from them, focusing on routing problems. Evaluates NCO methods and meta-heuristics on this setup.

Result: The performance gap between neural solvers and meta-heuristics narrows when learning from structured sub-samples.

Conclusion: Structuring problem instances enhances NCO's effectiveness, bridging the gap with specialized meta-heuristics.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization aims to learn to solve a class of
combinatorial problems through data-driven methods and notably through
employing neural networks by learning the underlying distribution of problem
instances. While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly
engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel
approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and,
more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In
application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that
represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training
instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the
routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large
problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized
Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the
performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized
meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed
base node distribution.

heavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring
critical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical
applications. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work
remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical
end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a
unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities
and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize
device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized
schematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning
LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal
diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform
images. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists,
AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the
formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for
simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve
the success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.

### [273] [Communication and Computation Efficient Split Federated Learning in O-RAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02534)
*Shunxian Gu,Chaoqun You,Bangbang Ren,Deke Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SplitMe, a split federated learning (SFL) framework, reduces communication costs and improves convergence in O-RAN by eliminating frequent data transfers and optimizing resource allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing model size in federated learning (FL) for O-RAN leads to longer training times, risking deadline violations for non- and near-RT RICs.

Method: SplitMe uses mutual learning to train models alternately at near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC, avoiding frequent transfers and optimizing resource allocation.

Result: SplitMe outperforms SFL, FedAvg, and O-RANFed in cost and convergence.

Conclusion: SplitMe effectively addresses communication and resource challenges in O-RAN, offering a scalable solution for FL.

Abstract: The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has
enabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data
from non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs).
However, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time,
jeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To
address this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by
offloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance
non-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent
data/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur
significant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of
computational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the
deadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL
framework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train
the near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating
frequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a
zeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint
optimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with
deadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our
numerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks
like SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.

*Xi Chen,Jianchuan Yang,Junjie Zhang,Runnan Yang,Xu Liu,Hong Wang,Ziyu Ren,Wenqi Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JacobiNet is a neural network-based method for solving PDEs with irregular boundaries, improving accuracy and efficiency over traditional PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs struggle with irregular boundaries due to normalization issues, boundary enforcement, and imbalanced loss terms. JacobiNet aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: JacobiNet uses lightweight MLPs to learn continuous, differentiable mappings from supervised point pairs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without meshing.

Result: JacobiNet reduces relative L2 error significantly (0.013-0.039 vs. 0.287-0.637) and improves accuracy by 18.3x, with 10x speedup in vessel-like domains.

Conclusion: JacobiNet offers a robust, efficient solution for PDEs with irregular boundaries, enhancing generalization, accuracy, and computational speed.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective for solving PDEs by
incorporating physical laws into the learning process. However, they face
challenges with irregular boundaries, leading to instability and slow
convergence due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement,
and imbalanced loss terms. A common solution is to map the domain to a regular
space, but traditional methods rely on case-specific meshes and simple
geometries, limiting their compatibility with modern frameworks. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce JacobiNet, a neural network-based coordinate
transformation method that learns continuous, differentiable mappings from
supervised point pairs. Utilizing lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet allows for direct
Jacobian computation via autograd and integrates seamlessly with downstream
PINNs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without the need for
meshing or explicit Jacobian computation. JacobiNet effectively addresses
normalization challenges, facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions,
and mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. It demonstrates
significant improvements, reducing the relative L2 error from 0.287-0.637 to
0.013-0.039, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.3*. In vessel-like
domains, it enables rapid mapping for unseen geometries, improving prediction
accuracy by 3.65* and achieving over 10* speedup, showcasing its
generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A large-scale validation of XAI methods in neuroimaging reveals failures in GradCAM and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, while SmoothGrad performs robustly, emphasizing the need for domain-specific XAI adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous validation for XAI methods in neuroimaging, ensuring trustworthy interpretations of deep learning models.

Method: A novel XAI validation framework was applied to ~45,000 structural brain MRIs, using tasks with known signal sources to establish verifiable ground truth.

Result: GradCAM failed to localize predictive features, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation produced artifactual explanations, while SmoothGrad was consistently accurate.

Conclusion: Domain-specific adaptation and validation of XAI methods are critical, and prior neuroimaging studies using standard XAI may need re-evaluation.

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for
neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack
rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

### [276] [Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02600)
*Xudong Wang,Tongxin Li,Chris Ding,Jicong Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARGNN introduces a framework for adaptive Riemannian metric learning in graphs, outperforming fixed-curvature GNNs by capturing diverse local geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometric GNNs fail to handle graphs with varying local curvature, necessitating a flexible approach.

Method: ARGNN learns a continuous, anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field per node, using a diagonal parameterization and Ricci flow-inspired regularization.

Result: Superior performance on homophilic and heterophilic datasets, with interpretable learned geometries.

Conclusion: ARGNN unifies prior GNNs, offers theoretical guarantees, and adaptively captures graph structure diversity.

Abstract: Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures
with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense
communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which
embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces,
struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph
Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and
anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node
to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to
the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient
parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable
diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining
computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training,
we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned
manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution
convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that
unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method
demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark
datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover,
the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying
graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.

*Ali Forootani,Mohammad Khosravi,Masoud Barati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepKoopFormer combines Transformers and Koopman theory for stable, interpretable time series forecasting, outperforming LSTMs and Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing interpretability and instability issues in Transformer-based models for high-dimensional, nonlinear time series forecasting.

Method: Modular encoder-propagator-decoder structure with a spectrally constrained linear Koopman operator, ensuring stability via spectral radius bounds and regularization.

Result: Outperforms LSTM and Transformer baselines in accuracy, noise robustness, and long-term stability across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DeepKoopFormer is a flexible, interpretable, and robust solution for forecasting in dynamic and high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and
environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and
nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved
state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from
interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical
uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting
framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the
theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular
encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a
spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose
structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy
regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and
interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic
dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface
pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation
dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all
experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline
Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term
forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible,
interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and
dynamical settings.

*Austin Rockman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 3x3 convolutional kernel trained on 200 audio samples produces emergent effects using Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK) and AuGAN, enabling unique audio transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how adversarial training can discover audio transformations from minimal data, offering new approaches to effect design.

Method: Uses CAK for identity-preserving transformations and AuGAN to verify control application instead of forgery detection.

Result: The kernel exhibits a diagonal structure, creating frequency-dependent temporal shifts for musical effects.

Conclusion: Adversarial training can effectively discover audio transformations from small datasets, opening new possibilities for effect design.

Abstract: We demonstrate that a single 3x3 convolutional kernel can produce emergent
audio effects when trained on 200 samples from a personalized corpus. We
achieve this through two key techniques: (1) Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK),
where output = input + (learned_pattern x control), with a soft-gate mechanism
supporting identity preservation at zero control; and (2) AuGAN (Audit GAN),
which reframes adversarial training from "is this real?" to "did you apply the
requested value?" Rather than learning to generate or detect forgeries, our
networks cooperate to verify control application, discovering unique
transformations. The learned kernel exhibits a diagonal structure creating
frequency-dependent temporal shifts that are capable of producing musical
effects based on input characteristics. Our results show the potential of
adversarial training to discover audio transformations from minimal data,
enabling new approaches to effect design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOST integrates low-rank and sparse structures for efficient LLM pre-training, achieving competitive performance with reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the prohibitive computational and memory costs of full-rank LLM pre-training by combining low-rank and sparse techniques effectively.

Method: Uses singular value decomposition to preserve low-rank components and constructs channel-wise sparse components for complementary expressiveness.

Result: LOST achieves competitive or superior performance to full-rank models while significantly reducing memory and compute overhead.

Conclusion: LOST is a promising method for efficient LLM pre-training, balancing performance and resource constraints.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive
computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies
have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing
model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a
complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank
compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,
existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a
simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance
degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for
LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures
to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency
constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices,
preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining
singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the
expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining
ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while
significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead. Moreover, Code is

### [280] [Revisiting Gossip Protocols: A Vision for Emergent Coordination in Agentic Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01531)
*Mansura Habiba,Nafiul I. Khan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper advocates for integrating gossip protocols into agentic AI systems to enhance decentralized, adaptive communication, addressing gaps in current structured protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current structured communication protocols lack the ability to support emergent, swarm-like intelligence in scalable, decentralized agent systems.

Method: The paper revisits gossip protocols, analyzing their potential for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI, and identifies unresolved challenges.

Result: Gossip protocols offer scalable, low-overhead knowledge dissemination but face challenges like semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness, and consistency.

Conclusion: Gossip protocols could complement structured protocols to enable resilient, self-organizing multi-agent systems, though open questions remain.

Abstract: As agentic platforms scale, agents are evolving beyond static roles and fixed
toolchains, creating a growing need for flexible, decentralized coordination.
Today's structured communication protocols (e.g., direct agent-to-agent
messaging) excel at reliability and task delegation, but they fall short in
enabling emergent, swarm-like intelligence, where distributed agents
continuously learn, adapt, and communicate to form collective cognition. This
paper revisits gossip protocols, long valued in distributed systems for their
fault tolerance and decentralization, and argues that they offer a missing
layer for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI. Gossip enables
scalable, low-overhead dissemination of shared knowledge, but also raises
unresolved challenges around semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness,
and consistency in high-stakes environments. Rather than proposing a new
framework, this work charts a research agenda for integrating gossip as a
complementary substrate alongside structured protocols. We identify critical
gaps in current agent-to-agent architectures, highlight where gossip could
reshape assumptions about coordination, and outline open questions around
intent propagation, knowledge decay, and peer-to-peer trust. Gossip is not a
silver bullet, but overlooking it risks missing a key path toward resilient,
reflexive, and self-organizing multi-agent systems.

*Gang Wang,Hongfang Han,Xiaowei Liu,Hanfeng Jiang,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Proposes GCBHA, a distributed algorithm for heterogeneous multi-task and multi-agent task allocation with time windows, improving accuracy and efficiency in automated warehouses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task allocation methods lack integration of multi-task, multi-attribute, and heterogeneous task allocation, and suffer from scenario constraints and high error rates.

Method: Decomposes tasks into subtasks, clusters similar tasks, allocates via auction, and evaluates path costs for accuracy.

Result: GCBHA reduces task allocation time and error rates, improving solution quality.

Conclusion: GCBHA effectively addresses heterogeneous task allocation challenges in automated warehouses.

Abstract: In scenarios like automated warehouses, assigning tasks to robots presents a
heterogeneous multi-task and multi-agent task allocation problem. However,
existing task allocation study ignores the integration of multi-task and
multi-attribute agent task allocation with heterogeneous task allocation. In
addition, current algorithms are limited by scenario constraints and can incur
significant errors in specific contexts. Therefore, this study proposes a
distributed heterogeneous multi-task and multi-agent task allocation algorithm
with a time window, called group consensus-based heterogeneous auction (GCBHA).
Firstly, this method decomposes tasks that exceed the capability of a single
Agent into subtasks that can be completed by multiple independent agents. And
then groups similar or adjacent tasks through a heuristic clustering method to
reduce the time required to reach a consensus. Subsequently, the task groups
are allocated to agents that meet the conditions through an auction process.
Furthermore, the method evaluates the task path cost distance based on the
scenario, which can calculate the task cost more accurately. The experimental
results demonstrate that GCBHA performs well in terms of task allocation time
and solution quality, with a significant reduction in the error rate between
predicted task costs and actual costs.

*Akshay Dodwadmath,Setareh Maghsudi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness in leader selection in Stackelberg games using multi-agent reinforcement learning with mediators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the unfairness in leader selection in Stackelberg games, especially when roles can be interchanged and agents are self-interested.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework integrating mediators for minimal control (leader selection).

Result: Mediators lead to fairer actions by self-interested agents, improving overall fairness in returns.

Conclusion: Mediators in Stackelberg games enhance fairness in leader selection and agent returns.

Abstract: Stackelberg games and their resulting equilibria have received increasing
attention in the multi-agent reinforcement learning literature. Each stage of a
traditional Stackelberg game involves a leader(s) acting first, followed by the
followers. In situations where the roles of leader(s) and followers can be
interchanged, the designated role can have considerable advantages, for
example, in first-mover advantage settings. Then the question arises: Who
should be the leader and when? A bias in the leader selection process can lead
to unfair outcomes. This problem is aggravated if the agents are
self-interested and care only about their goals and rewards. We formally define
this leader selection problem and show its relation to fairness in agents'
returns. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
that maximizes fairness by integrating mediators. Mediators have previously
been used in the simultaneous action setting with varying levels of control,
such as directly performing agents' actions or just recommending them. Our
framework integrates mediators in the Stackelberg setting with minimal control
(leader selection). We show that the presence of mediators leads to
self-interested agents taking fair actions, resulting in higher overall
fairness in agents' returns.
