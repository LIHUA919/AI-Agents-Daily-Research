### [1] [Language-Driven Hierarchical Task Structures as Explicit World Models for Multi-Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731)
*Brennen Hill*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Large Language Models to dynamically generate hierarchical scaffolds for World Models, enabling more efficient training of intelligent agents in complex multi-agent tasks like robotic soccer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning in high-fidelity simulators fails for complex multi-agent tasks due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. The development of explicit, hierarchical World Models is identified as a key bottleneck for advancing AI capabilities.

Method: The paper advocates for hierarchical scaffolding where complex goals are decomposed into structured subgoals. It proposes leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this hierarchical scaffold, creating language-configurable task layers that bridge low-level behaviors and high-level strategy.

Result: Based on a systematic review of 2024 multi-agent soccer research, the paper identifies a clear trend towards integrating symbolic/hierarchical methods with multi-agent reinforcement learning, where these approaches implicitly or explicitly construct task-based world models.

Conclusion: Language-driven world models provide intrinsic curriculum, dense learning signals, and compositional learning frameworks, enabling agent models to acquire sophisticated strategic behaviors with greater sample efficiency, creating a generalizable framework for next-generation intelligent agents.

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

### [2] [The Ethical Compass of the Machine: Evaluating Large Language Models for Decision Support in Construction Project Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04505)
*Somtochukwu Azie,Yiping Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show promise as decision-support tools in construction project management but have significant limitations in ethical reasoning, contextual understanding, and accountability, requiring human oversight rather than autonomous use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate the ethical viability and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in ethically sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts within construction project management.

Method: Mixed-methods research design involving quantitative performance testing of two leading LLMs against 12 real-world ethical scenarios using an Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), plus qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts.

Result: LLMs demonstrate adequate performance in structured domains like legal compliance but show significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed reservations about autonomous AI use for ethical judgments.

Conclusion: LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids rather than autonomous ethical agents, requiring robust human-in-the-loop oversight. The study introduces EDSAC as a replicable methodology for ethical AI evaluation.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

### [3] [ProToM: Promoting Prosocial Behaviour via Theory of Mind-Informed Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05091)
*Matteo Bortoletto,Yichao Zhou,Lance Ying,Tianmin Shu,Andreas Bulling*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProToM is an AI system that uses Theory of Mind and Bayesian inference to provide targeted feedback that promotes prosocial behavior in multi-agent systems, outperforming LLM baselines in efficiency and human preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans struggle with identifying when and how to assist others when pursuing independent goals, which hinders cooperation. The paper aims to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial behavior.

Method: ProToM uses Bayesian inverse planning to infer agents' goals, then selects feedback by maximizing expected utility based on the inferred goal distribution. It provides context-sensitive feedback to individual agents in multi-agent environments.

Result: ProToM outperformed state-of-the-art LLMs in two environments (Doors, Keys, and Gems; Overcooked), achieving higher success rates, shorter completion times, and was consistently preferred by human users. LLMs produced higher communication overhead and worse timing.

Conclusion: Theory of Mind-informed approaches like ProToM are more effective than LLMs for providing targeted, context-sensitive feedback that promotes prosocial behavior in multi-agent systems, leading to better cooperation and efficiency.

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

### [4] [Maestro: Joint Graph & Config Optimization for Reliable AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04642)
*Wenxiao Wang,Priyatham Kattakinda,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro is a holistic optimizer for LLM agents that jointly searches over both graph structures and node configurations, outperforming existing prompt-only optimizers by addressing structural failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent optimizers only tune configurations while keeping the graph structure fixed, leaving structural failure modes unaddressed. There's a need for a holistic approach that optimizes both graph structure and node configurations.

Method: Maestro is a framework-agnostic optimizer that jointly searches over graphs (modules and information flow) and configurations (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). It uses reflective textual feedback from traces to prioritize edits and improve sample efficiency.

Result: On IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro outperforms leading prompt optimizers (MIPROv2, GEPA, GEPA+Merge) by average margins of 12%, 4.9%, and 4.86% respectively. Even in prompt-only optimization, it leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Achieves results with fewer rollouts than GEPA.

Conclusion: Joint graph and configuration search effectively addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning alone cannot fix, demonstrating significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks and real-world applications like interviewer and RAG agents.

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

### [5] [Towards Personalized Explanations for Health Simulations: A Mixed-Methods Framework for Stakeholder-Centric Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04646)
*Philippe J. Giabbanelli,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for generating tailored explanations of health simulations using LLMs to address diverse stakeholder needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health simulation models are complex and inaccessible to stakeholders who need them most, and current LLM approaches provide generic summaries that don't meet varied informational needs.

Method: Mixed-methods design: eliciting stakeholder explanation needs and stylistic preferences, optimizing LLMs via controllable attribute tuning, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

Result: A step-by-step framework that enables LLMs to generate customized explanations for different health stakeholders.

Conclusion: The framework addresses the gap in tailored health simulation explanations and improves accessibility for diverse stakeholder groups.

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

### [6] [An Approach to Grounding AI Model Evaluations in Human-derived Criteria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04676)
*Sasha Mitts*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes human-derived evaluation criteria to enhance AI benchmarks for physical world modeling, identifying key cognitive skills through interviews and surveys to create more human-aligned evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI benchmarks fall short in capturing nuanced capabilities, particularly in physical world modeling. There's a need for more interpretable and applicable evaluation methods that align with human cognitive processes.

Method: Conducted in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys using Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks to identify critical cognitive skills (Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, Contextualizing) for both AI and human reasoning.

Result: Found that participants perceive AI as lacking interpretive and empathetic skills but hold high expectations for AI performance. Developed a framework integrating human insights into benchmark design for more human-aligned evaluation.

Conclusion: User-centered evaluation is crucial for AI development. The proposed approach enhances current benchmarking practices and provides actionable guidelines for aligning AI capabilities with human cognitive processes, setting the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human
cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices
and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

### [7] [What-If Analysis of Large Language Models: Explore the Game World Using Proactive Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04791)
*Yuan Sui,Yanming Zhang,Yi Liao,Yu Gu,Guohua Tang,Zhongqian Sun,Wei Yang,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WiA-LLM introduces what-if analysis to LLMs, enabling proactive thinking and future state forecasting through reinforcement learning, achieving 74.2% accuracy in game-state prediction with 2x gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs currently lack the ability to systematically explore hypothetical futures and forecast consequences before acting, which limits their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning and real-time decision making.

Method: Integrates What-If Analysis (WIA) with reinforcement learning to enable LLMs to dynamically simulate outcomes of potential actions and anticipate future states rather than just react to present conditions.

Result: Achieves 74.2% accuracy in forecasting game-state changes in Honor of Kings (2x improvement over baselines), with particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios requiring accurate foresight.

Conclusion: WiA-LLM represents the first formal integration of what-if analysis capabilities in LLMs, providing a scalable framework for proactive reasoning and robust decision-making in dynamic environments with broad strategic applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

### [8] [TalkToAgent: A Human-centric Explanation of Reinforcement Learning Agents with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04809)
*Haechang Kim,Hao Chen,Can Li,Jong Min Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TalkToAgent is a multi-agent LLM framework that provides interactive natural language explanations for RL policies using five specialized agents to map user queries to XRL tools and generate various explanation types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts due to limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current approaches, leaving users uncertain about which tools to use.

Method: A multi-agent LLM framework with five specialized agents (Coordinator, Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, Debugger) that automatically maps user queries to relevant XRL tools and provides explanations through key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual explanations.

Result: Successfully mapped user queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, minimized failures in counterfactual generation through coder-debugger interactions, and effectively interpreted agent's actions within the problem domain.

Conclusion: TalkToAgent provides an effective framework for delivering interactive, natural language explanations for RL policies, bridging the gap between complex RL systems and domain experts through multi-agent LLM collaboration.

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

### [9] [Collaboration and Conflict between Humans and Language Models through the Lens of Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04847)
*Mukul Singh,Arjun Radhakrishna,Sumit Gulwani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Language models demonstrate strong cooperative behavior in iterated prisoner's dilemma, matching or exceeding classical strategies with niceness, provocability, and rapid adaptability to opponent strategy changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate language model cooperative and competitive behavior in long-horizon multi-party interactions, addressing gaps in prior work that focused on isolated or short-term game-theoretic contexts.

Method: Conducted Axelrod-style tournament pitting language model agents against 240 classical strategies in iterated prisoner's dilemma, with strategy switch experiments to test adaptability.

Result: Language models achieved performance on par with or exceeding best-known classical strategies, exhibiting key cooperative properties and rapid adaptability to opponent strategy changes within few rounds.

Conclusion: First systematic characterization of long-term cooperative behaviors in language model agents, providing foundation for research in complex human-AI social environments.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

*Krittanon Kaewtawee,Wachiravit Modecrua,Krittin Pachtrachai,Touchapon Kraisingkorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Methodology for cloning conversational voice AI agents from call recordings, with evaluation showing AI approaches human performance in routine tasks but underperforms in persuasion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate repetitive tasks, reduce operational costs, and provide constant support in domains like customer service and healthcare using voice assistants.

Method: General methodology using call transcripts, integrating automatic speech recognition, large language model dialogue manager, and text-to-speech synthesis in streaming pipeline. Uses domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt engineering.

Result: AI agent approaches human performance in routine call aspects (introduction, product communication) but underperforms in persuasion and objection handling compared to human agents.

Conclusion: Identifies design lessons and future research directions including large scale simulation and automated evaluation to improve AI performance in persuasive tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

TL;DR: OSC is a knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework that enhances cognitive synergy in multi-agent systems by enabling real-time cognitive gap analysis and adaptive communication adjustments between expert agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work has advanced agent selection and result aggregation, but efficient linguistic interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical bottleneck that needs to be addressed.

Method: OSC introduces Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to enable each agent to dynamically perceive collaborators' cognitive states, with real-time cognitive gap analysis that allows agents to adaptively adjust communication behaviors including content focus, detail level, and expression style.

Result: Experiments on complex reasoning and problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task performance and communication efficiency, transforming individual agents into a deeply collaborative cognitive team.

Conclusion: The framework not only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM agent interaction behaviors, serving as a pivotal intermediate layer between selection and aggregation processes.

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

### [12] [SparkUI-Parser: Enhancing GUI Perception with Robust Grounding and Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04908)
*Hongyi Jing,Jiafu Chen,Chen Rao,Ziqiang Dang,Jiajie Teng,Tianyi Chu,Juncheng Mo,Shuo Fang,Huaizhong Lin,Rui Lv,Chenguang Ma,Lei Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SparkUI-Parser is a novel end-to-end framework that improves GUI perception by using continuous coordinate modeling instead of discrete text-based methods, achieving higher accuracy and faster inference while enabling full interface parsing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs for GUI perception have limitations: discrete coordinate modeling results in lower accuracy and slower inference, and they can only locate predefined elements rather than parse entire interfaces, limiting broad application.

Method: Uses continuous coordinate modeling with a pre-trained MLLM, adding a token router and coordinate decoder. Includes a rejection mechanism based on modified Hungarian matching to identify non-existent elements and reduce false positives.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance of SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks, with improved accuracy and inference speed.

Conclusion: SparkUI-Parser successfully addresses limitations of prior methods by enabling continuous coordinate modeling and full interface parsing, making it more robust and efficient for GUI perception tasks.

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at
https://github.com/antgroup/SparkUI-Parser.

*Barbara Gendron,Gaël Guibon,Mathieu D'aquin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ontology-based approach to formalize conversational features for LLM controllability, enabling quantitative definitions of qualitative concepts like language proficiency levels for consistent and explainable AI responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of ensuring predictable and user-personalized responses from LLMs by providing formal, quantitative definitions for typically qualitative conversational features.

Method: Leverage linguistic descriptors to derive quantitative definitions, formalize them in description logic, incorporate into an ontology, and use this to guide LLM fine-tuning for controlled text generation.

Result: Experimental results show consistent and explainable proficiency-level definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI systems.

Conclusion: The ontology-based framework successfully enables formal definition and reasoning about conversational features, enhancing LLM controllability and response predictability.

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

*Rajesh Tembarai Krishnamachari,Srividya Rajesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DOVIS is a five-layer protocol that enables privacy-preserving agent performance tracking and AgentRank-UC, a dynamic ranking algorithm that combines usage frequency and competence metrics to create trustworthy agent rankings for the emerging Web of Agents ecosystem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The internet is evolving into a Web of Agents where autonomous AI agents interact and collaborate at scale, but current systems lack a transparent network for tracking agent performance, making reliable agent ranking infeasible without coordination.

Method: Proposes DOVIS (Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics) - a five-layer protocol for collecting minimal, privacy-preserving usage and performance aggregates. Implements AgentRank-UC algorithm that combines usage frequency and competence metrics (outcome quality, cost, safety, latency) into unified rankings.

Result: Simulation results and theoretical guarantees demonstrate convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance, showing viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware ranking for scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

Conclusion: The proposed DOVIS protocol and AgentRank-UC algorithm provide a foundation for enabling trustworthy agent ranking in the emerging Web of Agents ecosystem, addressing the challenge of fragmented and private usage signals through coordinated, privacy-preserving performance tracking.

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling methods rely on redundant sampling and ignore historical experience utilization, limiting computational efficiency during inference.

Method: Proposes a framework with three collaborative LRMs that extract, refine, and reuse critical information (stickers) across multiple reasoning rounds. Uses a two-stage optimization strategy combining imitation learning with self-improvement for progressive refinement.

Result: Extensive evaluations on AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH benchmarks show Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines including self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches under comparable inference budgets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of sticker-guided historical experience utilization for improving computational efficiency and performance in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are

TL;DR: A formal semantics for ODRL based on query answering that enables policy evaluation and comparison for digital rights management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ODRL has become the de facto standard for governing digital resource access, but lacks a comprehensive formal semantics despite preliminary progress on formal specification.

Method: Developed a simple and intuitive formal semantics based on query answering that refines previous formalizations and aligns with ODRL 2.2 specification.

Result: Created a formal evaluation semantics that enables comparison of ODRL policies to detect equivalent, more restrictive, or more permissive policies.

Conclusion: The proposed formal semantics provides a foundation for evaluating and comparing computational policies in ODRL, particularly useful for data sharing scenarios.

Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies
in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto
standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although
preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the
language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.
In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

Conclusion: LatticeWorld demonstrates an effective approach to streamline 3D world generation pipelines, offering significant efficiency improvements and high-quality results for creating interactive virtual environments with dynamic agents and physics simulation.

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo

*Wonseo Jang,Dongjae Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACED-DQN framework uses ensemble of diversified DQN agents with arbitration control to prevent catastrophic forgetting in continual RL, inspired by human prefrontal cortex decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL models suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios, losing previously learned knowledge and performing poorly in dynamic environments.

Method: Ensemble of diversified DQN variants with different value functions + arbitration control mechanism that prioritizes agents with higher reliability in recent trials.

Result: Significant performance improvements in both static and continual environments, demonstrating effective continual learning capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework enables RL agents to continuously learn effectively by mimicking human brain arbitration mechanisms, solving catastrophic forgetting problem in CRL.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-SafeML is a novel safety monitoring approach for Quantum Machine Learning that adapts classical SafeML with quantum-specific distance measures to detect concept drifts and enhance system safety in QML applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety monitoring methods for classical machine learning are not applicable to Quantum Machine Learning due to fundamental differences in quantum computation, and dedicated safety mechanisms for QML remain underdeveloped.

Method: Adapts SafeML's statistical distance approach with quantum-centric distance measures that align with QML's probabilistic nature, using model-dependent post-classification evaluation instead of dataset-driven approaches.

Result: Experiments on QCNN and VQC models demonstrate that Q-SafeML effectively detects distances between operational and training data, addressing concept drifts in QML and enabling informed human oversight.

Conclusion: Q-SafeML represents a significant advancement in QML safety by providing tailored monitoring that enhances system transparency and safety through quantum-appropriate distance metrics and detection of concept drifts.

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

TL;DR: The paper proposes financially grounded loss functions based on Sharpe ratio, PnL, and Maximum Drawdown, plus turnover regularization, which outperform traditional MSE for trading strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning needs better financial performance metrics as classical approaches are not optimal for finance where specialists use different evaluation metrics.

Method: Introduce loss functions derived from quantitative finance metrics (Sharpe ratio, PnL, Maximum Drawdown) and propose turnover regularization to constrain position turnover.

Result: The proposed loss functions with turnover regularization outperform traditional mean squared error loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading metrics.

Conclusion: Financially grounded metrics enhance predictive performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

### [23] [Bootstrapping Task Spaces for Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04575)
*Minqi Jiang,Andrei Lupu,Yoram Bachrach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExIt is an autocurriculum RL method that trains LLMs for multi-step self-improvement by selectively sampling informative intermediate steps during training, enabling effective inference-time iteration beyond training depths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL approaches for self-improvement tasks assume fixed maximum iteration depths, which can be costly and arbitrary. There's a need for methods that can train agents to reliably self-improve over sequences at inference-time without these limitations.

Method: Exploratory Iteration (ExIt) grows a task space by selectively sampling the most informative intermediate partial histories encountered during episodes, treating these as new self-iteration task instances to train a self-improvement policy. It can pair with explicit exploration mechanisms for sustained task diversity.

Result: Across competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and machine learning engineering domains, ExIt produces policies that exhibit strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out tasks and can iterate towards higher performance beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

Conclusion: ExIt effectively enables LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at inference-time while only training on single-step iterations, demonstrating the method's ability to generalize beyond training iteration depths and sustain improvement over extended step budgets.

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

*Jiequn Han,Kui Ren,Nathan Soedjak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing compact training datasets for inverse problem solutions, dynamically allocating samples based on specific test instances for improved sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learning-based approaches require large training datasets from prior distributions, which becomes costly when priors have high intrinsic dimensions or high accuracy is needed. The method aims to reduce data collection costs.

Method: Iteratively refines training dataset conditioned on latest prediction, dynamically allocating sampling effort based on specific test instance to tailor dataset to inverse map geometry around each test instance.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in inverse scattering problem with structured priors. Adaptive method shows more pronounced advantages with complex priors or higher accuracy requirements.

Conclusion: The adaptive sampling strategy is broadly applicable to other inverse problems, offering a scalable and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-task learning methods fail to exploit task complementarities and require more computational resources for independent task training and inference in ADMET prediction.

Method: Built on Chemprop-RDKit backbone with quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations, plus an exponential task weighting scheme combining dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters for dynamic loss balancing.

Result: Significantly outperforms single-task baselines on 12 out of 13 TDC classification benchmarks with minimal model complexity and fast inference.

Conclusion: QW-MTL demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed features and adaptive task weighting for ADMET prediction.

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed

*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic comparison of representational similarity metrics shows that metrics with stronger alignment constraints provide better discriminative power for separating different model families, with soft-matching performing best among mapping-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic comparisons of representational similarity metrics' discriminative power across different model families and training regimes in neuroscience and AI research.

Method: Developed a quantitative framework using three separability measures (dprime, silhouette coefficients, ROC-AUC) to evaluate commonly used metrics (RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, soft matching) across various architectures and training regimes.

Result: Separability increases with more stringent alignment constraints; soft-matching achieved highest separability among mapping-based approaches, followed by Procrustes and linear predictivity; non-fitting methods like RSA also showed strong separability.

Conclusion: This study provides the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through separability analysis, clarifying their relative sensitivity and offering guidance for metric selection in large-scale model and brain comparisons.

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

*David Millard,Lars Lindemann,Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends split conformal prediction to function spaces for neural operators, providing finite-sample coverage guarantees through discretization and asymptotic convergence analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators lacks finite-sample coverage guarantees in infinite-dimensional settings, and existing methods require strong assumptions or yield conservative coverage.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Establish finite-sample coverage in finite-dimensional space using discretization, 2) Lift guarantees to function-space through asymptotic convergence analysis with decomposition of conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and misspecification components.

Result: Method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully extends conformal prediction to function spaces, providing reliable uncertainty quantification for neural operators with finite-sample guarantees and improved performance across different resolutions.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

*Arash Behboodi,Alvaro H. C. Correia,Fabio Valerio Massoli,Christos Louizos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transductive conformal prediction shows a fundamental trade-off: higher confidence requires exponentially larger prediction sets, with size scaling with sample count and conditional entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental limitations and trade-offs in transductive conformal prediction methods, particularly how confidence levels affect prediction set efficiency.

Method: Derived strict finite-sample bounds showing exponential growth of prediction set size with confidence level, analyzed scaling with conditional entropy and dispersion, and examined special case of identical labels.

Result: Proved any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential prediction set growth, with exponent scaling linearly with sample count and proportional to conditional entropy. Achievable bound in idealized settings.

Conclusion: Transductive conformal prediction faces inherent efficiency-confidence trade-off where higher confidence demands exponentially larger prediction sets, fundamentally limited by data uncertainty and conditional entropy.

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

*Jonas A. Actor,Anthony Gruber,Eric C. Cyr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Attention mechanisms in transformers are mathematically connected to multinomial regression, showing that transformer representations evolve to recover optimal classification features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the opaque attention mechanism in transformers and its relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity and superposition, which remain poorly understood despite attention's central role.

Method: Established a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial regression by showing that optimizing over latent features in fixed multinomial regression yields solutions that align with attention block dynamics.

Result: The evolution of representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that recovers the optimal features for classification.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms in transformers mathematically correspond to feature optimization processes in multinomial regression, providing new interpretability insights into transformer dynamics.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

*Yuhan Helena Liu,Victor Geadah,Jonathan Pillow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A flexible nonparametric framework using deep neural networks to infer biological learning rules from animal decision-making data during de novo task learning, revealing asymmetric updates and history dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how animals learn new behaviors from scratch without assuming specific parametric forms for learning rules, which is relevant for developing animal- or human-aligned AI.

Method: Proposed a nonparametric framework parameterizing per-trial policy weight updates with deep neural networks (DNNs), extended to recurrent variants (RNNs) to capture non-Markovian dynamics and history dependence.

Result: Validated framework by recovering ground-truth rules in simulation, improved predictions on held-out behavioral data from mice learning sensory decision-making tasks, and revealed asymmetric updates after correct vs error trials with history dependence.

Conclusion: Introduced a flexible framework for inferring biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks, providing insights for experimental training protocols and behavioral digital twins development.

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

### [32] [Beyond Ordinary Lipschitz Constraints: Differentially Private Stochastic Optimization with Tsybakov Noise Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04668)
*Difei Xu,Meng Ding,Zihang Xiang,Jinhui Xu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies Differential Privacy in Stochastic Convex Optimization under Tsybakov Noise Condition, proposing novel algorithms with utility bounds independent of Lipschitz constant and establishing matching lower bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous DP-SCO studies didn't consider the Tsybakov Noise Condition where Lipschitz constants can be extremely large or unbounded, but gradients have bounded moments. This work addresses this gap.

Method: Proposed (ε,δ)-DP algorithms for Lipschitz and non-Lipschitz cases under TNC with parameter θ>1, analyzing utility bounds in terms of sample size, dimension, and gradient moments.

Result: Achieved utility bounds independent of Lipschitz constant: Õ((r̃_2k(1/√n + √d/nε))^(k-1)/k)^(θ/(θ-1)) for Lipschitz case, and improved bounds for small ε. Showed matching lower bounds for ρ-zero Concentrated DP.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first comprehensive study of DP-SCO under Tsybakov Noise Condition, establishing optimal rates that depend on gradient moments rather than Lipschitz constants, with matching upper and lower bounds.

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

*Yazdan Babazadeh Maghsoodlo,Madhur Anand,Chris T. Bauch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning models can detect flickering patterns (noise-driven switching between stable states) in complex systems, providing early warning signals for critical regime shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flickering is a key indicator of reduced resilience in climate, ecosystems, and financial systems, often preceding impactful but hard-to-predict regime shifts, yet deep learning's potential for detecting flickering remains unexplored.

Method: Used convolutional LSTM (CNN LSTM) models trained on synthetic time series generated from simple polynomial functions with additive noise to identify flickering patterns.

Result: Models generalized well to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detected flickering in empirical datasets including dormouse body temperature records and African Humid Period palaeoclimate proxies.

Conclusion: Deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across various dynamical systems.

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

### [34] [KRAFT: A Knowledge Graph-Based Framework for Automated Map Conflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04684)
*Farnoosh Hashemi,Laks V. S. Lakshmanan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KRAFT is a learning-based map conflation approach that addresses limitations of traditional methods by using knowledge graphs, neural matching, and optimization for merging spatial entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing map conflation methods are limited to linear objects and use heuristic approaches, missing most map entities and lacking data-driven learning capabilities.

Method: Three-part approach: (1) Knowledge Graph Construction to represent geospatial databases, (2) Map Matching using knowledge graph alignment and geospatial feature encoding, (3) Map Merging via mixed integer linear programming for consistent integration.

Result: KRAFT achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with each module separately outperforming traditional matching and merging approaches.

Conclusion: KRAFT provides a comprehensive learning-based solution for map conflation that handles both linear and non-linear objects while ensuring consistency through optimization techniques.

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework that aligns EMG signals with pose representations to enable zero-shot gesture classification, outperforming benchmarks by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve gesture classification using low-power biosignals (EMG) by aligning them with high-quality structured data (pose) for better representation learning and zero-shot capability.

Method: Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework that learns an EMG encoder to produce pose-informative representations aligned with structured pose data.

Result: Outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture classification and 72% on out-of-distribution (unseen) gesture classification.

Conclusion: Aligning weak-modality EMG data with structured pose representations enables high-quality gesture classification and effective zero-shot performance on unseen gestures.

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

### [36] [Natural Spectral Fusion: p-Exponent Cyclic Scheduling and Early Decision-Boundary Alignment in First-Order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04713)
*Gongyue Zhang,Honghai Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Natural Spectral Fusion (NSF) is a novel optimization framework that treats first-order optimizers as spectral controllers, dynamically balancing low- and high-frequency information through p-exponent cyclic scheduling without modifying models or training pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spectral behavior of machine learning models has been widely studied, but the intrinsic frequency preference of optimizers themselves remains unclear. The authors aim to understand and control how optimizers reshape the optimization path through their spectral biases.

Method: Proposes Natural Spectral Fusion (NSF) with two core principles: treating optimizers as spectral controllers that dynamically balance frequency information, and periodically reweighting frequency bands. Implemented via p-exponent extension of second-moment term (allowing both positive and negative exponents) with cyclic scheduling.

Result: Theory and experiments show adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and enables early decision-boundary alignment. Across benchmarks, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior, sometimes achieving baseline accuracy with only 25% training cost.

Conclusion: NSF reveals optimizers' role as active spectral controllers and provides a unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization that works without modifying models, data, or training pipelines.

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoVeR is a model-free conformal prediction decoding strategy that ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories while maintaining compact search space, with theoretical guarantees of at least 1-α coverage rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoding strategies like beam search lack provable coverage guarantees and struggle to balance efficiency with versatile trajectories, especially for long-tail sequences important in real-world applications.

Method: Proposes CoVeR, a novel model-free decoding strategy within the conformal prediction framework that maintains compact search space while ensuring high coverage probability.

Result: Theoretical analysis establishes a PAC-style generalization bound guaranteeing CoVeR asymptotically achieves coverage rate of at least 1-α for any target level α ∈ (0,1).

Conclusion: CoVeR addresses limitations of current decoding methods by providing provable coverage guarantees while maintaining search efficiency, making it suitable for complex reasoning tasks requiring diverse trajectory coverage.

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Beyond I-Con framework introduces alternative statistical divergences and similarity kernels to improve representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art results in unsupervised clustering, supervised contrastive learning, and dimensionality reduction by replacing KL divergence with more suitable divergences like total variation distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KL divergence used in existing representation learning methods has limitations including asymmetry, unboundedness, and potential misalignment with true objectives, which creates optimization challenges.

Method: Developed Beyond I-Con framework that systematically explores alternative statistical divergences (like total variation distance and bounded f-divergences) and similarity kernels (distance-based instead of angular) to replace KL divergence in representation learning.

Result: (1) Achieved SOTA in unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings using TV distance; (2) Outperformed standard supervised contrastive learning with TV + distance-based kernel; (3) Superior qualitative results and downstream performance in dimensionality reduction using bounded f-divergence instead of KL.

Conclusion: Divergence and similarity kernel choices are crucial for representation learning optimization, and moving beyond KL divergence can lead to significant performance improvements across various learning tasks.

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streamlined transformer architectures like CATS may overlook fine-grained local temporal dependencies that classical statistical models like VARMA effectively capture, creating a gap in modeling capabilities.

Method: Proposes VARMAformer with two innovations: 1) VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that models AR and MA patterns at patch level, and 2) VARMA-Enhanced Attention mechanism with temporal gate for context-aware queries.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show VARMAformer consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in time series forecasting.

Conclusion: Integrating classical statistical insights into modern deep learning frameworks provides significant benefits for time series forecasting, validating the synergy between traditional and modern approaches.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in GNNs by developing efficient methods to remove sensitive training data without compromising graph topology or imposing structural restrictions.

Method: Proposed three methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering that utilize graph topological features.

Result: Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show superior performance in model utility, unlearning utility, and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The methods effectively protect sensitive node privacy in GNNs while maintaining good performance-complexity trade-off, contributing to enhanced privacy and security in graph neural networks.

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

TL;DR: Proposed methodology uses artificial chaotic time series generation and resampling to create financial training data, achieving significant performance improvements in Bitcoin price prediction through large-scale pre-training with 10B samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial time series forecasting is challenging due to chaotic properties, and existing foundation models need better approaches to handle financial data's unique characteristics through synthetic data generation.

Method: Generate artificial chaotic time series, apply resampling techniques to simulate financial data, conduct large-scale pre-training with 10B samples per case, and perform zero-shot prediction on actual Bitcoin trade data without retraining.

Result: Significant performance improvements over autocorrelation models in trading strategy profitability, observed scaling law phenomenon where predictive performance improves with exponentially increasing training samples for extended horizons.

Conclusion: Scaling law suggests potential for near-future event prediction with substantial computational resources; future research should focus on larger-scale training and verifying scaling law applicability across diverse chaotic models.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

TL;DR: Embedding-based alignment process using Sentence-BERT to link German job titles to occupational ontologies through semantic search, eliminating need for hand-crafted ontologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of computationally expensive and manually maintained hand-crafted ontologies for cross-source occupational data reasoning in labor market analytics.

Method: Fine-tune Sentence-BERT model on German job title data to learn ontology structure, create similarity graph for efficient approximate nearest-neighbor semantic search classification.

Result: Developed scalable approach that bridges diverse occupational vocabularies without extensive human curation, enabling flexible classification with potential for adding more classes.

Conclusion: Machine learning embeddings provide scalable alternative to traditional ontologies, with ongoing work to extend to multilingual titles and additional ontologies.

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

*Artem Lensky,Yiding Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning models for EEG blink detection, with CNN-RNN hybrid achieving best accuracy (up to 95.8% in healthy subjects, 75.8% in Parkinson's patients) using 1-5 frontal electrodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blinks in EEG are often treated as artifacts but contain valuable physiological information about cognitive load, attention, and neurological disorders. Accurate blink detection is crucial for monitoring these markers.

Method: Evaluated various deep learning architectures (RNNs, CNNs, TCNs, transformers, hybrids) for sequence-to-sequence blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes with minimal pre-processing on raw EEG signals from 31 subjects (15 healthy, 16 Parkinson's).

Result: CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently outperformed others, achieving 93.8%-95.8% accuracy in healthy cohort and 73.8%-75.8% in Parkinson's patients across different electrode configurations. Demonstrated robustness to tremor in Parkinson's patients.

Conclusion: Deep learning models, particularly CNN-RNN hybrids, can effectively detect blinks in EEG signals with high accuracy, enabling reliable computation of blink rate and statistics for cognitive and neurological monitoring applications.

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bistochastic normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting disentangles class similarity from distribution bias in confusion matrices, enabling better model diagnosis and improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Confusion matrices mix class similarity and distribution bias effects, making it hard to understand true classifier performance and identify specific improvement areas.

Method: Introduces bistochastic normalization via Iterative Proportional Fitting, generalizing row/column normalization to recover underlying class similarity structure.

Result: The method successfully disentangles error sources, provides geometric interpretation in class representation space, and enables more accurate model behavior diagnosis.

Conclusion: Bistochastic normalization offers deeper insights into classifier performance by separating class confusion patterns from distribution effects, supporting targeted model improvements.

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

TL;DR: NeuSA introduces spectral-inspired PINNs that overcome spectral bias and causality issues in PDE solving by combining spectral basis projection with Neural ODEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MLP-based PINNs fail to converge on complex initial-value problems, violating causality and suffering from spectral bias towards low frequencies.

Method: NeuSA learns PDE projection onto spectral basis for finite-dimensional representation, integrated with adapted Neural ODE to leverage high-frequency components and enforce causality.

Result: Validated on linear/nonlinear wave equations, showing faster convergence, improved temporal consistency, and superior accuracy compared to other architectures.

Conclusion: NeuSA effectively addresses key limitations of PINNs through spectral methods integration, providing better performance for PDE solving with variable coefficients.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

*Mounvik K,N Harshit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lightweight 1D CNN with structured pruning achieves efficient EEG seizure detection, maintaining 92.87% accuracy while reducing model size by 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational challenges of deep learning models for real-time EEG seizure detection in resource-limited environments.

Method: One-dimensional CNN with structured pruning (removing 50% of convolutional kernels) and mild early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Result: 92.78% accuracy and 0.8686 macro-F1 score before pruning; improved to 92.87% accuracy and 0.8707 macro-F1 after 50% weight/memory reduction.

Conclusion: Structured pruning effectively removes redundancy, improves generalization, and provides efficient seizure detection suitable for resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

TL;DR: Topology-aware graph RL for cloud routing optimization using SASE for state encoding and PAGU for adaptive graph updates, outperforming baselines on real-world GEANT dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address decision instability and insufficient structural awareness in routing policy optimization under dynamic cloud network topologies.

Method: Integrates Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) with multi-layer graph convolution and structural embeddings, plus Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism for adaptive structural updates.

Result: Outperforms existing graph RL models across throughput, latency control, and link balance metrics on GEANT topology dataset.

Conclusion: Proposed approach enables efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud networks through topology-aware graph reinforcement learning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

Conclusion: RapidGNN effectively addresses communication overhead in distributed GNN training through deterministic scheduling and caching, delivering significant performance and efficiency gains across various graph scales and topologies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based
approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead
remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training
framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient
cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales
and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to
3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while
cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further
demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing
units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over
the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

TL;DR: SAR and SAR^2 methods stabilize test-time adaptation by addressing batch norm instability and representation collapse through gradient-aware sample filtering, sharpness-aware optimization, and representation regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often fail in real-world scenarios with mixed distribution shifts, small batch sizes, and imbalanced label distributions, primarily due to batch norm instability and model collapse into trivial solutions.

Method: Proposed SAR method uses sharpness-aware entropy minimization to filter noisy samples with large gradients and encourage flat minima. SAR^2 adds redundancy and inequity regularizers to prevent representation collapse by reducing feature correlations and maximizing prediction entropy.

Result: The methods demonstrate stable performance across challenging test scenarios including mixed distribution shifts, small batches, and imbalanced data, outperforming prior TTA approaches while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Addressing batch norm instability and representation collapse through gradient-aware filtering and representation regularization enables more robust test-time adaptation in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address efficiency bottlenecks in Transformer-based LLMs where training computation scales quadratically with sequence length and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Also enable large model development on non-NVIDIA platforms.

Method: Three-pronged approach: (1) Model architecture with linear/hybrid-linear attention and adaptive spiking neurons, (2) Algorithmic optimizations including conversion-based training pipeline and spike coding framework, (3) System engineering with customized frameworks and parallelism strategies for MetaX hardware.

Result: Developed SpikingBrain-7B (linear LLM) and SpikingBrain-76B (hybrid-linear MoE LLM) that achieve performance comparable to open-source Transformers using only ~150B tokens. Achieved 100x speedup in Time to First Token for 4M-token sequences, 23.4% Model FLOPs Utilization, 69.15% sparsity for low-power operation, and stable training on hundreds of MetaX GPUs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of brain-inspired mechanisms for next-generation efficient and scalable large model design, enabling large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms with superior long-sequence efficiency and constant memory inference.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directed evolution is time-consuming and expensive due to iterative protein variant synthesis and biochemical screening. Machine learning can help select better variants to improve efficiency and reduce screening costs.

Method: Combines Bayesian optimization with informative protein variant representations extracted from a pre-trained protein language model (sequence embeddings).

Result: The new representation significantly improves Bayesian optimization performance, yielding better results with the same number of screenings, and outperforms state-of-the-art regression-based methods.

Conclusion: Protein language model embeddings enhance machine-learning-assisted directed evolution, providing more efficient variant selection and better performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising

necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same

outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution

TL;DR: Novel neural network initialization method that incorporates layer depth information and increases variance from first to last layer for better performance in deep networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing initialization schemes either ignore depth information or don't properly address variance propagation in deep networks, where theoretical unit variance assumptions fail.

Method: Proposed a flexible variance-increasing initialization scheme that incorporates both individual layer depth and total network depth information.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method outperforms existing initialization schemes like Glorot, He, orthogonal matrix, and random walk methods.

Conclusion: Depth-aware initialization with controlled variance increase from first to last layer is crucial for optimal performance in deep neural networks.

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

Conclusion: Multimodal integration with deep survival learning provides promising personalized risk stratification for prostate and bladder cancer, with broad applicability to survival prediction using heterogeneous biomedical data.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

TL;DR: Proposes recurrent encoder for neural combinatorial optimization that reuses computation between steps, achieving equivalent/better performance with 3x fewer layers and lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NCO construction methods make small state changes between steps but don't efficiently reuse prior computations, leading to inefficiency.

Method: Train recurrent encoder that computes state embeddings based on both current state and previous step's embeddings, enabling computation reuse.

Result: Recurrent encoder achieves equivalent or better performance than non-recurrent encoder with 3x fewer layers, significantly improving latency.

Conclusion: Recurrent approach is effective for NCO problems (TSP, CVRP, OP) and integrates well with large neighborhood search, demonstrating practical relevance.

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to
showcase the practical relevance of our findings.

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot

U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

### [58] [Should We Always Train Models on Fine-Grained Classes?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05130)
*Davide Pirovano,Federico Milanesio,Michele Caselle,Piero Fariselli,Matteo Osella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-grained label training doesn't always improve classification accuracy - effectiveness depends on data geometry, label hierarchy relationships, dataset size, and model capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether training with fine-grained labels universally improves classification performance in hierarchical label settings, as empirical evidence suggests but lacks systematic understanding.

Method: Used both real and synthetic datasets to analyze how fine-grained label training affects classification accuracy, examining factors like data geometric structure, label hierarchy relations, dataset size, and model capacity.

Result: Fine-grained training does not universally improve accuracy; effectiveness depends critically on data geometry and its relationship with label hierarchy, plus dataset size and model capacity factors.

Conclusion: The benefit of fine-grained label training is conditional rather than universal, requiring careful consideration of data structure, hierarchy relationships, and model/dataset characteristics for optimal performance.

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

*Tosca Lechner,Alex Bie,Gautam Kamath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learnability with adaptive adversaries is strictly stronger than with oblivious adversaries, as adaptive adversaries can intercept and manipulate samples directly while oblivious adversaries only modify the underlying distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the differences in learnability when facing adaptive adversaries (who can intercept and manipulate samples) versus oblivious adversaries (who only modify the underlying distribution).

Method: Formulated a general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries considering adversary budget, and compared it to learnability with oblivious adversaries.

Result: Learnability with respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

Conclusion: The ability to learn in the presence of adaptive adversaries requires more robust learning algorithms than those sufficient for oblivious adversaries, highlighting the increased challenge posed by adaptive manipulation of samples.

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for integrating privately owned data and expanding training resources for complex foundational models through federated learning, as no unified survey currently exists.

Method: Conducted literature review of over 4,200 articles, narrowed to 250+ thoroughly reviewed articles with 42 unique methods, structured around a novel taxonomy following development lifecycle stages.

Result: Created a comprehensive taxonomy and technical comparison of methods based on complexity, efficiency, and scalability, providing practical insights and implementation guidelines.

Conclusion: The survey provides a self-contained overview of the field, offering valuable insights for adopting, evolving, and integrating foundational models with federated learning, particularly in domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed
articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods
were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on
complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a
self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but
also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and
integrating foundational models with federated learning.

*Dmitry Akulov,Mohamed Sana,Antonio De Domenico,Tareq Si Salem,Nicola Piovesan,Fadhel Ayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel KV cache compression method using attention-guided composite tokens that reduces memory usage while maintaining accuracy and compatibility with standard inference engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache size grows linearly with context length and model depth, creating a major bottleneck for long-context LLM inference. Existing compression methods either use rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized compute kernels.

Method: Attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite token framework that aggregates attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens independently, and aligns them into composite tokens while respecting uniform cache structure. Includes global allocation mechanism to adapt retention budgets across layers.

Result: Achieves significant memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior structured and semi-structured compression methods.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment that remains fully compatible with standard inference pipelines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

### [62] [Shift Before You Learn: Enabling Low-Rank Representations in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05193)
*Bastien Dubail,Stefan Stojanovic,Alexandre Proutière*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper challenges the common low-rank assumption in successor measures for RL, showing that the shifted successor measure (bypassing initial transitions) naturally exhibits low-rank structure with better estimation guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many RL algorithms assume low-rank structure in successor measures, but the authors find this assumption doesn't hold for the standard successor measure itself, motivating the need for a shifted version.

Method: The authors analyze the spectral recoverability of the shifted successor measure, derive Type II Poincaré inequalities for Markov chains, and provide finite-sample performance guarantees for low-rank approximation from sampled entries.

Result: The analysis shows that shifting the successor measure enables effective low-rank approximation with small shift requirements in practice, and connects the necessary shift to local mixing properties of the dynamical system.

Conclusion: Shifting the successor measure leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL, validating that the shifted version rather than the original successor measure exhibits the desired low-rank properties.

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Conclusion: FedSub provides an effective solution for efficient federated learning on heterogeneous data with reduced resource costs and improved convergence properties.

Abstract: This work addresses the key challenges of applying federated learning to
large-scale deep neural networks, particularly the issue of client drift due to
data heterogeneity across clients and the high costs of communication,

TL;DR: Deep learning models for amine emission forecasting and carbon capture system performance monitoring using LSTM architectures, achieving >99% accuracy and enabling operational optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop data-driven deep learning approaches for real-time monitoring and optimization of amine-based carbon capture systems, addressing the need for predictive tools that can handle both steady-state and dynamic operational conditions.

Method: Developed four DL architectures (Basic LSTM, Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, Convolutional LSTM) using operational data from CESAR1 solvent campaign. Models predict amine emissions (AMP and Piperazine) and four system performance parameters. Conducted causal impact analysis by perturbing 8 input variables ±20% to assess operational impacts.

Result: Models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99%, effectively tracking both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Causal analysis revealed that adjusting specific parameters (lean solvent temperature, water wash conditions) can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system performance.

Conclusion: ML framework serves as both predictive tool and decision support system, enabling real-time monitoring, scenario testing, and operational optimization for carbon capture systems. Represents a step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies for enhanced efficiency and sustainability.

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

TL;DR: Proposes interpretable Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for detecting False Data Injection Attacks in power grid AGC systems, achieving ~96% detection rates with low false alarms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AGC systems are vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks like FDIAs that evade conventional detection methods, requiring more interpretable and accurate detection approaches.

Method: Uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to learn complex nonlinear relationships in AGC measurements, with capability to extract symbolic equations for enhanced interpretability.

Result: Achieves FDIA detection rates of 95.97% for the initial model and 95.9% for the symbolic formula, both with low false alarm rates.

Conclusion: KAN provides an interpretable and reliable approach for enhancing AGC cybersecurity against stealthy cyberattacks while maintaining high detection accuracy.

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

TL;DR: Systematic benchmarking of 7 DRL algorithms shows significant variations in energy efficiency, with some algorithms consuming 24% less energy and emitting 68% less CO2 while maintaining comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning raise environmental and economic concerns, yet energy requirements and costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.

Method: Benchmarked 7 state-of-the-art DRL algorithms (DQN, TRPO, A2C, ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, QR-DQN) on 10 Atari games for 1M steps each, measuring real-time power consumption to estimate energy usage, CO2 emissions, and electricity costs.

Result: Substantial variation in energy efficiency: ARS vs DQN - 24% less energy; QR-DQN vs RecurrentPPO - 68% less CO2 emissions and 68% lower monetary cost. Identified trade-offs between performance, training time, energy use, and cost.

Conclusion: Algorithmic choices can mitigate environmental and economic impact without sacrificing performance. Provides foundation for energy-aware DRL practices and incorporating sustainability into future algorithmic design.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

TL;DR: Learning distributed ADMM hyperparameters via graph neural networks for faster convergence and better solution quality


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADMM is popular for distributed optimization but suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices

Method: Represent ADMM iterations as graph neural network message-passing, learn adaptive step sizes and communication weights via GNN, train end-to-end by unrolling ADMM

Result: Learned variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared to standard ADMM

Conclusion: GNN-based learning approach effectively optimizes ADMM hyperparameters while preserving convergence properties

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

TL;DR: DRL-PUT is a deep reinforcement learning framework for personalized utility tuning in ad recommender systems that replaces manual parameter tuning with an RL-based approach, achieving significant improvements in click-through rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual tuning of ranking utility functions in ad recommenders is suboptimal due to unprincipled objectives, vast parameter combinations, and lack of personalization and adaptability to seasonality.

Method: Formulated as an RL task where optimal hyperparameters are predicted for each ad request state to maximize predefined rewards. Uses online serving logs to directly learn optimal policy without value function estimation.

Result: Online A/B testing showed 9.7% improvement in click-through rate and 7.7% improvement in long click-through rate compared to manual tuning baseline.

Conclusion: DRL-PUT effectively addresses multi-objective optimization challenges in ad recommender systems through personalized, adaptive parameter tuning using reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.

TL;DR: LLM agents in El Farol Bar problem show emergent social dynamics, balancing game-theoretic rationality with human-like social motivations, creating new group decision-making models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLM agents autonomously navigate the classic social dilemma of the El Farol Bar problem and observe their emergent social behaviors.

Method: Using LLM agents in a spatially extended El Farol Bar problem setup with prompt-specified constraints (60% threshold) and analyzing their decision-making patterns.

Result: LLM agents developed spontaneous motivation to attend the bar, changed decision-making to collective behavior, and exhibited human-like incomplete problem solving rather than perfect optimization.

Conclusion: LLM agents naturally balance external game-theoretic constraints with internal social preferences, enabling new models of group decision-making that transcend traditional game-theoretic approaches.

Abstract: We investigate the emergent social dynamics of Large Language Model (LLM)
agents in a spatially extended El Farol Bar problem, observing how they
autonomously navigate this classic social dilemma. As a result, the LLM agents
generated a spontaneous motivation to go to the bar and changed their decision
making by becoming a collective. We also observed that the LLM agents did not
solve the problem completely, but rather behaved more like humans. These
findings reveal a complex interplay between external incentives
(prompt-specified constraints such as the 60\% threshold) and internal
incentives (culturally-encoded social preferences derived from pre-training),
demonstrating that LLM agents naturally balance formal game-theoretic
rationality with social motivations that characterize human behavior. These
findings suggest that a new model of group decision making, which could not be
handled in the previous game-theoretic problem setting, can be realized by LLM
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited resources of individual network devices hinder efficient operation of LLM-enabled agents with complex tool calls, creating an urgent need for efficient multi-level device collaborations in 6G networks.

Method: Proposes a dual-loop framework: outer loop for global agent and sub-agents collaboration with task decomposition and parallel distribution; inner loop for sub-agents to circularly reason, execute, and replan sub-tasks with parallel tool calling and offloading strategies.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved task planning capability and task execution efficiency, validated through a case study in 6G-supported urban safety governance.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-loop terminal-edge collaboration framework addresses resource limitations in 6G networks and accelerates the development of LLM-enabled multi-agent systems, though open challenges remain for future research.

Abstract: The ubiquitous computing resources in 6G networks provide ideal environments
for the fusion of large language models (LLMs) and intelligent services through
the agent framework. With auxiliary modules and planning cores, LLM-enabled
agents can autonomously plan and take actions to deal with diverse environment
semantics and user intentions. However, the limited resources of individual
network devices significantly hinder the efficient operation of LLM-enabled
agents with complex tool calls, highlighting the urgent need for efficient
multi-level device collaborations. To this end, the framework and method of the
LLM-enabled multi-agent system with dual-loop terminal-edge collaborations are
proposed in 6G networks. Firstly, the outer loop consists of the iterative
collaborations between the global agent and multiple sub-agents deployed on
edge servers and terminals, where the planning capability is enhanced through
task decomposition and parallel sub-task distribution. Secondly, the inner loop
utilizes sub-agents with dedicated roles to circularly reason, execute, and
replan the sub-task, and the parallel tool calling generation with offloading
strategies is incorporated to improve efficiency. The improved task planning
capability and task execution efficiency are validated through the conducted
case study in 6G-supported urban safety governance. Finally, the open
challenges and future directions are thoroughly analyzed in 6G networks,
accelerating the advent of the 6G era.
