In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that\nenforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby\npromoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient\nentropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step\nfunction and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we\nterm it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major\napplications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably\nestimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and\nleverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context\nLearning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract\natomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature\nextraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to\navoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense\nfeatures while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among\nbaselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature\nextractor.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes Binary Autoencoder (BAE) with entropy minimization to extract sparse, independent features from LLM hidden states, addressing dense feature issues in existing methods.", "motivation": "Existing feature extraction methods for LLMs produce dense features due to lack of global sparsity guarantees, harming feature sparsity and atomization.", "method": "Uses autoencoder with entropy minimization on minibatches, discretizes activations to 1-bit via step function with gradient estimation for backpropagation.", "result": "BAE enables reliable entropy calculation for analyzing LLM inference dynamics and extracts more interpretable features than baselines while avoiding dense features.", "conclusion": "BAE effectively serves as a feature extractor by promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances through entropy minimization."}}

However, since the optimization\nproblem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),\nmost of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the\noptimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first\nprovably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized\nlinear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm.\nHowever, using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high\nprice. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes\ndefined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\\geq 1$ but $p\\neq \\infty$, and provide a\nnew algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for\ngeneralized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,\nwe demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of\nrecourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also\nexhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its\nvalidity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides\nmore sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to\npost-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents a new algorithm for computing optimal robust recourse in algorithmic decision-making systems that is resilient to model updates, using L^p norms instead of L^\u221e norm to achieve lower-cost recourses.", "motivation": "Current robust recourse methods using L^\u221e norm can lead to high-cost recourses, and existing approaches lack theoretical guarantees for optimality.
