Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:\ncausal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it\nbecomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.\nStudying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal\nabstraction should lead to exciting future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper critiques causal abstraction in interpretability, showing unrestricted alignment maps can trivialize it, and highlights the need for assumptions about information encoding.", "motivation": "To examine the limitations of causal abstraction in interpretability, especially when alignment maps are not constrained by linearity.", "method": "Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, including mapping randomly initialized models to algorithms.", "result": "Unrestricted alignment maps make causal abstraction trivial, and empirical tests show perfect mapping even for incapable models.", "conclusion": "Causal abstraction alone is insufficient for interpretability without assumptions about information encoding, suggesting future research directions."}}
