However, as the\nnetwork depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe,\ncausing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes\nthe mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization\nand introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.\nSpecifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after\nmultiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,\nsimilar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this\ncontext, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of\nlow-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of\nhigh-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we\nsystematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson\nlocalization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in\nGraph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed\nthe potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in\ninformation propagation."}

This\narticle highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust\nquantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically\nconsiders varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load\nbalancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent\nclient-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global\nexpert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these\nsystemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training\nmechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way\nfor the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in\nedge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency."}

Feature-based\nmethods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion\nimitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and\nstruggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in\ncontrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and\nadaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward\nsignals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of\nstructured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions,\ncontrollable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the\ndichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced:\nrather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by\ntask-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and\nadaptability. This work outlines the algorithmic trade-offs and design\nconsiderations that underlie method selection, offering a framework for\nprincipled decision-making in learning from demonstrations."}

Despite its remarkable empirical success,\nits theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works\npredominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent\nwith momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\\bm{x}_{t+1} = \\bm{x}_t -\n\\frac{\\gamma_t}{{\\sqrt{\\bm{v}_t}+\\epsilon}} \\circ \\bm{m}_t$. This perspective\nnecessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy\nand opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In\ncontrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like\noptimizer, expressed as $\\bm{x}_{t+1} = \\bm{x}_t - \\gamma_t\n\\frac{|\\bm{m}_t|}{{\\sqrt{\\bm{v}_t}+\\epsilon}} \\circ {\\rm Sign}(\\bm{m}_t)$.

We present the subspace-based approximate Hessian\n(ZO-SAH) method, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that mitigates these\ncosts by focusing on randomly selected two-dimensional subspaces.
