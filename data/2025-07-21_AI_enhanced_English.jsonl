Model tracing supports identifying consecutive\nproblem-solving steps taken by a student, whereas constraint-based modeling\nsupports student input diagnosis even when several steps are combined into one\nstep. We propose an approach that merges both paradigms. By defining\nconstraints as properties that a student input has in common with a step of a\nstrategy, it is possible to provide a diagnosis when a student deviates from a\nstrategy even when the student combines several steps. In this study we explore\nthe design of a system for multistep strategy diagnoses, and evaluate these\ndiagnoses. As a proof of concept, we generate diagnoses for an existing dataset\ncontaining steps students take when solving quadratic equations (n=2136). To\ncompare with human diagnoses, two teachers coded a random sample of deviations\n(n=70) and applications of the strategy (n=70).
