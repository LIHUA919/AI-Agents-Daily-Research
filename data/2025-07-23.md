### [1] [From Reasoning to Super-Intelligence: A Search-Theoretic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15865)
*Shai Shalev-Shwartz,Amnon Shashua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Diligent Learner, a new learning paradigm that models reasoning as depth-first search with validation and backtracking to overcome limitations of existing Chain-of-Thought approaches in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought reasoning methods (SFT, RL, ToT, MCTS) often fail on complex reasoning tasks due to core obstacles including distribution drift, lack of embedded search, and exponential inference costs. The theoretical foundations for learning from CoT data are also underdeveloped.

Method: The Diligent Learner paradigm explicitly models reasoning as a depth-first search process guided by a validator component and supports backtracking when failures occur. This approach addresses the identified obstacles in existing CoT learning methods.

Result: Under two mild and realistic assumptions, the authors prove that the Diligent Learner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to achieve the same effectiveness on complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The Diligent Learner framework provides a scalable path toward building reliable reasoning systems that can be trained on naturally occurring, incomplete data, potentially enabling the development of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with robust and interpretable problem-solving capabilities.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing
the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the
theoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped, and
existing approaches -- such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement
Learning (RL), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) --
often fail on complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we identify core obstacles
that hinder effective CoT learning, including distribution drift, lack of
embedded search, and exponential inference costs. We introduce the Diligent
Learner, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models reasoning as a
depth-first search guided by a validator and supports backtracking upon
failure. Under two mild and realistic assumptions, we prove that the Diligent
Learner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to do
so. This framework offers a path toward building scalable and reliable
reasoning systems trained on naturally occurring, incomplete data -- paving the
way for the development of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with robust,
interpretable problem-solving abilities.

### [2] [Purchase and Production Optimization in a Meat Processing Plant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15866)
*Marek Vlk,Premysl Sucha,Jaroslaw Rudy,Radoslaw Idzikowski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an optimization solution for meat processing companies to efficiently manage material purchasing and processing, addressing real-world constraints like minimum order quantities and percentage requirements that make the problem NP-hard, solved using an iterative integer linear programming approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The meat production industry faces escalating challenges due to the European energy crisis, making efficient use of input materials essential for company profitability. Existing literature focuses on supply chain management rather than the production stage optimization, and neglects important real-world constraints like minimum order quantities and minimum percentage requirements in alternative processing methods.

Method: The authors develop a simple iterative approach based on integer linear programming (ILP) to solve the optimization problem. The method addresses alternative material processing ways, stock management with different expiration dates, and incorporates previously neglected constraints (minimum order quantity and minimum percentage in alternatives). They use an open-source ILP solver to avoid numerical issues experienced with commercial solvers.

Result: The algorithm successfully finds optimal solutions within seconds for all considered real-life use cases using actual data from a meat processing company. The approach effectively handles the extensive range of data values and mitigates numerical issues that occurred with commercial solvers.

Conclusion: The paper proves that both minimum order quantity and minimum percentage constraints make the problem NP-hard, but demonstrates that the proposed iterative integer linear programming approach can efficiently solve real-world instances. The method provides a practical solution for meat processing companies to optimize their material purchasing and processing decisions under realistic operational constraints.

Abstract: The food production industry, especially the meat production sector, faces
many challenges that have even escalated due to the recent outbreak of the
energy crisis in the European Union. Therefore, efficient use of input
materials is an essential aspect affecting the profit of such companies. This
paper addresses an optimization problem concerning the purchase and subsequent
material processing we solved for a meat processing company. Unlike the
majority of existing papers, we do not concentrate on how this problem concerns
supply chain management, but we focus purely on the production stage. The
problem involves the concept of alternative ways of material processing, stock
of material with different expiration dates, and extra constraints widely
neglected in the current literature, namely, the minimum order quantity and the
minimum percentage in alternatives. We prove that each of these two constraints
makes the problem \mbox{$\mathcal{NP}$-hard}, and hence we design a simple
iterative approach based on integer linear programming that allows us to solve
real-life instances even using an open-source integer linear programming
solver. Another advantage of this approach is that it mitigates numerical
issues, caused by the extensive range of data values, we experienced with a
commercial solver. The results obtained using real data from the meat
processing company showed that our algorithm can find the optimum solution in a
few seconds for all considered use cases.

### [3] [Why Braking? Scenario Extraction and Reasoning Utilizing LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15874)
*Yin Wu,Daniel Slieter,Vivek Subramanian,Ahmed Abouelazm,Robin Bohn,J. Marius ZÃ¶llner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and classify driving scenarios, particularly focusing on identifying why vehicles brake in safety-critical situations, outperforming traditional rule-based methods in complex urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of ADAS driving data mostly captures routine behavior, making it challenging to identify safety-critical corner cases. Existing rule-based methods work well on highways but fail to generalize in complex urban settings. There's a need to understand "why does a vehicle brake?" to identify potentially hazardous situations.

Method: The authors propose a framework that leverages Large Language Models to bridge low-level numerical signals and natural language descriptions for scenario interpretation. They implement a dual-path scenario retrieval system supporting both category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based retrieval for unknown Out-of-Distribution scenarios.

Result: The method outperforms rule-based baselines and demonstrates good generalization to Out-of-Distribution scenarios. Experimental validation was conducted using curated scenario annotations on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset.

Conclusion: The LLM-based framework successfully addresses the limitations of rule-based approaches in complex urban environments, providing better scenario understanding and classification capabilities for safety-critical driving situations, particularly for identifying and reasoning about braking events.

Abstract: The growing number of ADAS-equipped vehicles has led to a dramatic increase
in driving data, yet most of them capture routine driving behavior. Identifying
and understanding safety-critical corner cases within this vast dataset remains
a significant challenge. Braking events are particularly indicative of
potentially hazardous situations, motivating the central question of our
research: Why does a vehicle brake? Existing approaches primarily rely on
rule-based heuristics to retrieve target scenarios using predefined condition
filters. While effective in simple environments such as highways, these methods
lack generalization in complex urban settings. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) for scenario
understanding and reasoning. Our method bridges the gap between low-level
numerical signals and natural language descriptions, enabling LLM to interpret
and classify driving scenarios. We propose a dual-path scenario retrieval that
supports both category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based
retrieval for unknown Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate
evaluation, we curate scenario annotations on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms rule-based baselines and
generalizes well to OOD scenarios.

### [4] [Differential Multimodal Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15875)
*Jerry Li,Timothy Oh,Joseph Hoang,Vardhit Veeramachaneni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper extends Differential Attention mechanism from text-only models to multimodal text-vision models (PaliGemma) to reduce noise and hallucinations in small language models with limited context windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models face challenges with limited context windows when incorporating additional modalities like vision, which introduces noise. Transformer attention mechanisms often focus disproportionately on irrelevant contexts, leading to hallucinations and poor information retrieval.

Method: The authors extended the Differential Attention mechanism (originally designed for text-only models) to the text-vision model PaliGemma 3B. They fine-tuned the model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and experimented with various parameter settings and configurations to integrate Differential Attention.

Result: The experiments demonstrated that Differential Attention can be successfully adapted and integrated into existing multimodal models during fine-tuning, leading to enhanced noisy information retrieval and improved question-answering capabilities.

Conclusion: Differential Attention mechanism can be effectively extended from text-only to text-vision models, providing a viable solution for reducing hallucinations and improving information retrieval in small multimodal language models with limited context windows.

Abstract: Small language models have gained significant popularity due to their
efficiency and growing capabilities. However, incorporating additional
modalities, such as vision, can exacerbate the challenge of limited context
windows by introducing noise. Recent studies have highlighted that Transformer
attention mechanisms often disproportionately focus on irrelevant contexts. In
this work, we extend the Differential Attention mechanism, originally designed
for text-only models, to the text-vision model PaliGemma. Our aim is to
evaluate its ability to mitigate noisy information retrieval and reduce
hallucinations. To this end, we fine-tuned the PaliGemma 3B model using LoRA,
incorporating Differential Attention, and experimented with various parameter
settings and configurations. We demonstrate that Differential Attention can be
adapted and integrated into the fine-tuning of existing models to enhance noisy
information retrieval and question-answering capabilities.

### [5] [Re-evaluating Short- and Long-Term Trend Factors in CTA Replication: A Bayesian Graphical Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15876)
*Eric Benhamou,Jean-Jacques Ohana,Alban Etienne,BÃ©atrice Guez,Ethan Setrouk,Thomas Jacquot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) by decomposing their returns into short-term trend, long-term trend, and market beta factors using Bayesian graphical models to understand how different time horizons affect risk-adjusted performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The relative merits and interactions between short-term versus long-term trend-following systems in CTA strategies remain controversial despite extensive research, creating a need to better understand how different time horizons contribute to overall performance.

Method: Dynamic decomposition of CTA returns using a Bayesian graphical model to separate contributions from short-term trend factors, long-term trend factors, and market beta factors.

Result: The study demonstrates how the blend of different time horizons (short-term vs long-term trends) influences the strategy's risk-adjusted performance, providing insights into the factor composition of CTA returns.

Conclusion: The research contributes to the trend-following debate by providing a systematic framework for understanding how different trend horizons interact and affect CTA performance, offering clearer insights into the structure of these trading strategies.

Abstract: Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) have historically relied on trend-following
rules that operate on vastly different horizons from long-term breakouts that
capture major directional moves to short-term momentum signals that thrive in
fast-moving markets. Despite a large body of work on trend following, the
relative merits and interactions of short-versus long-term trend systems remain
controversial. This paper adds to the debate by (i) dynamically decomposing CTA
returns into short-term trend, long-term trend and market beta factors using a
Bayesian graphical model, and (ii) showing how the blend of horizons shapes the
strategy's risk-adjusted performance.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Generalization in the ARC-AGI Domain: Comparing Execution-Guided Neural Program Synthesis and Test-Time Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15877)
*Simon Ouellette*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper compares neural program synthesis and test-time fine-tuning (TTFT) approaches on ARC-AGI, finding that execution-guided neural program synthesis better handles compositional generalization, while TTFT mainly helps by eliciting existing in-distribution knowledge from LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare different approaches for compositional generalization in the challenging ARC-AGI domain, which requires out-of-distribution generalization by design, and understand how neural program synthesis and test-time fine-tuning perform in open-world problem solving scenarios.

Method: The authors conducted a controlled compositional generalization experiment in the ARC-AGI domain, comparing neural program synthesis (specifically execution-guided approaches) against test-time fine-tuning methods and other reference algorithms.

Result: Execution-guided neural program synthesis outperformed all reference algorithms in composing novel solutions for out-of-distribution generalization. Test-time fine-tuning showed success primarily by helping LLMs access in-distribution knowledge they already possessed but couldn't directly utilize.

Conclusion: Neural program synthesis with execution guidance is more effective than test-time fine-tuning for true compositional generalization in open-world domains like ARC-AGI. TTFT's benefits appear limited to eliciting existing knowledge rather than enabling genuine out-of-distribution reasoning.

Abstract: We run a controlled compositional generalization experiment in the ARC-AGI
domain: an open-world problem domain in which the ability to generalize
out-of-distribution is, by design, an essential characteristic for success. We
compare neural program synthesis and test-time fine-tuning approaches on this
experiment. We find that execution-guided neural program synthesis outperforms
all reference algorithms in its ability to compose novel solutions. Our
empirical findings also suggest that the success of TTFT on ARC-AGI lies mainly
in eliciting in-distribution knowledge that the LLM otherwise fails to rely on
directly.

### [7] [The Recursive Coherence Principle: A Formal Constraint on Scalable Intelligence, Alignment, and Reasoning Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15880)
*Andy E. Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle (RCP), which states that intelligent systems require structural coherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. The authors propose the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only architecture capable of maintaining semantic coherence at scale, arguing that common AI problems stem from recursive coherence breakdown.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As complex AI systems grow in scale, maintaining coherence becomes increasingly fragile. Current AI systems experience issues like misalignment, hallucination, and instability, which the authors argue are symptoms of structural coherence loss. There's a need for a foundational principle that ensures semantic consistency across recursive reasoning processes in scalable intelligent systems.

Method: The paper formally defines the Recursive Coherence Principle (RCP) as a foundational constraint for reasoning systems. They introduce the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as a minimal, composable architecture with specific internal functions (evaluation, modeling, adaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions (storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning). The authors provide formal proofs demonstrating that systems lacking FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown at scale.

Result: The research establishes that the FMI is the only known operator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The authors prove that any system without FMI will suffer recursive coherence breakdown as it scales, linking common AI problems (misalignment, hallucination, instability) to structural coherence loss rather than just behavioral issues.

Conclusion: The work advocates for a paradigm shift from behavioral constraints to structural coherence in AI alignment. The RCP and FMI provide a pathway for developing safely generalizable and robustly coherent AI systems at scale. This approach uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics necessary for coherent, alignable intelligence, offering significant implications for AI alignment and scalable AI development.

Abstract: Intelligence-biological, artificial, or collective-requires structural
coherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. As complex
systems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures
semantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle
(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order
N, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic
coherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator
that spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this
coherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system
can reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We
formally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known
operator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,
composable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,
adaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions
(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving
semantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any
system lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it
scales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and
instability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other
foundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics
needed for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under
recursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift
from behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for
safely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale.

### [8] [Advancing Responsible Innovation in Agentic AI: A study of Ethical Frameworks for Household Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15901)
*Joydeep Chandra,Satyam Kumar Navneet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper surveys ethical challenges and design considerations for proactive AI agents in smart homes, with special focus on protecting vulnerable user groups through responsible innovation frameworks and human-centered design principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from reactive to proactive autonomous AI agents in household environments creates new ethical challenges around privacy, fairness, and user control, particularly for vulnerable populations like elderly, children, and neurodivergent individuals who face heightened risks of surveillance and bias.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive review of responsible innovation frameworks, human-centered design principles, and governance practices. They analyze applications of agentic AI and explore data-driven insights including social media analysis via Natural Language Processing to understand user needs and ethical concerns.

Result: The study identifies key design imperatives for ethical smart home systems including tailored explainability mechanisms, granular consent controls, robust override capabilities, and participatory/inclusive design methodologies. Specific vulnerabilities and risks for different user groups are characterized in detail.

Conclusion: The paper provides both conceptual foundations and practical guidance for developing transparent, inclusive, and trustworthy agentic AI in household automation, emphasizing the need for specialized protections for vulnerable users and comprehensive ethical frameworks in smart home design.

Abstract: The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in household environments,
especially in the form of proactive autonomous agents, brings about
possibilities of comfort and attention as well as it comes with intra or
extramural ethical challenges. This article analyzes agentic AI and its
applications, focusing on its move from reactive to proactive autonomy,
privacy, fairness and user control. We review responsible innovation
frameworks, human-centered design principles, and governance practices to
distill practical guidance for ethical smart home systems. Vulnerable user
groups such as elderly individuals, children, and neurodivergent who face
higher risks of surveillance, bias, and privacy risks were studied in detail in
context of Agentic AI. Design imperatives are highlighted such as tailored
explainability, granular consent mechanisms, and robust override controls,
supported by participatory and inclusive methodologies. It was also explored
how data-driven insights, including social media analysis via Natural Language
Processing(NLP), can inform specific user needs and ethical concerns. This
survey aims to provide both a conceptual foundation and suggestions for
developing transparent, inclusive, and trustworthy agentic AI in household
automation.

### [9] [ADEPTS: A Capability Framework for Human-Centered Agent Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15885)
*Pierluca D'Oro,Caley Drooff,Joy Chen,Joseph Tighe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ADEPTS, a capability framework that defines six core user-facing principles for developing human-centered AI agents, bridging the gap between technical development and user experience design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current guidance for AI agent development is fragmented across UX heuristics, engineering taxonomies, and ethics checklists, lacking a unified, user-facing vocabulary that defines what agents should fundamentally be able to do for human-centered design.

Method: The authors developed ADEPTS, a capability framework based on six principles for human-centered agent design that express minimal user-facing capabilities needed for agents to be understandable, controllable, and trustworthy in everyday use.

Result: ADEPTS provides a compact framework that sits at the interface between technical and experience development, offering actionable guidance for AI researchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers while complementing existing frameworks and taxonomies.

Conclusion: ADEPTS has the potential to accelerate improvement of user-relevant agent capabilities, ease the design of experiences that leverage those capabilities, and provide a shared language for tracking and discussing AI agent development progress.

Abstract: Large language models have paved the way to powerful and flexible AI agents,
assisting humans by increasingly integrating into their daily life. This
flexibility, potential, and growing adoption demands a holistic and
cross-disciplinary approach to developing, monitoring and discussing the
capabilities required for agent-driven user experiences. However, current
guidance on human-centered AI agent development is scattered: UX heuristics
focus on interface behaviors, engineering taxonomies describe internal
pipelines, and ethics checklists address high-level governance. There is no
concise, user-facing vocabulary that tells teams what an agent should
fundamentally be able to do. We introduce ADEPTS, a capability framework
defining a set of core user-facing capabilities to provide unified guidance
around the development of AI agents. ADEPTS is based on six principles for
human-centered agent design, that express the minimal, user-facing capabilities
an AI agent should demonstrate to be understandable, controllable and
trustworthy in everyday use. ADEPTS complements existing frameworks and
taxonomies; differently from them, it sits at the interface between technical
and experience development. By presenting ADEPTS, we aim to condense complex
AI-UX requirements into a compact framework that is actionable guidance for AI
researchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers alike. We believe
ADEPTS has the potential of accelerating the improvement of user-relevant agent
capabilities, of easing the design of experiences that take advantage of those
capabilities, and of providing a shared language to track and discuss progress
around the development of AI agents.

### [10] [Integrating Reason-Based Moral Decision-Making in the Reinforcement Learning Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15895)
*Lisa Dargasz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents Reason-Based Artificial Moral Agents (RBAMAs), an extension of reinforcement learning that enables AI agents to make ethical decisions through normative reasoning and case-based learning, addressing the need for moral behavior in autonomous systems approaching real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents like humanoid robots and autonomous cars transition from laboratory prototypes to real-world deployment, there is an urgent need to ensure they behave ethically. Current reinforcement learning approaches lack mechanisms for moral decision-making, creating a gap between technical capability and ethical requirements for autonomous systems operating in society.

Method: The paper develops RBAMAs by extending the reinforcement learning architecture with moral reasoning capabilities. The agents learn a "reason-theory" through case-based feedback that enables them to process morally relevant propositions and derive moral obligations. The architecture ensures agents adapt their behavior to conform to these moral obligations while pursuing their designated tasks.

Result: The study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and demonstrates its potential through initial experiments. The framework shows promise in enabling agents to make morally justifiable decisions, exhibiting moral robustness and trustworthiness in their actions.

Conclusion: RBAMAs provide a concrete and deployable framework for developing artificial moral agents that fulfill key ethical requirements. The extended reinforcement learning architecture successfully integrates normative reasoning capabilities, making it suitable for real-world deployment of autonomous systems that need to operate ethically while maintaining task performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a machine learning methodology that has
demonstrated strong performance across a variety of tasks. In particular, it
plays a central role in the development of artificial autonomous agents. As
these agents become increasingly capable, market readiness is rapidly
approaching, which means those agents, for example taking the form of humanoid
robots or autonomous cars, are poised to transition from laboratory prototypes
to autonomous operation in real-world environments. This transition raises
concerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the
requirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research
directed toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave
ethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a
range of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy.
This study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents
(RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning
architecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative
reasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn
a reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant
propositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback. They
are designed such that they adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these
obligations while they pursue their designated tasks. These features contribute
to the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and
their moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a
concrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key
ethical desiderata. This study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and
demonstrates the potential of RBAMAs in initial experiments.

### [11] [Does More Inference-Time Compute Really Help Robustness?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15974)
*Tong Wu,Chong Xiang,Jiachen T. Wang,Weichen Yu,Chawin Sitawarin,Vikash Sehwag,Prateek Mittal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines inference-time scaling in reasoning LLMs, finding that while it improves robustness when reasoning steps are hidden, it actually reduces robustness when intermediate steps are exposed to adversaries, creating an important security vulnerability that practitioners must consider.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work showed that increasing inference-time computation improves robustness in large proprietary reasoning LLMs, but this relied on the implicit assumption that intermediate reasoning steps remain hidden from adversaries. The authors wanted to test this assumption and examine the security implications when reasoning steps become accessible.

Method: The researchers applied budget forcing strategy to smaller-scale, open-source models (DeepSeek R1, Qwen3, Phi-reasoning) and systematically tested robustness under two conditions: hidden vs. exposed intermediate reasoning steps. They empirically verified an inverse scaling law and analyzed practical attack scenarios including tool-integrated reasoning and reasoning extraction attacks.

Result: Smaller open-source models benefit from inference-time scaling when reasoning is hidden. However, when intermediate reasoning steps are exposed to adversaries, increased inference-time computation consistently reduces model robustness, following an inverse scaling law. This creates significant security vulnerabilities in real-world deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: The robustness benefits of inference-time scaling are heavily dependent on the adversarial setting and deployment context. Practitioners must carefully consider the trade-offs between improved reasoning and potential security risks, especially in security-sensitive applications where reasoning steps might be exposed or extracted.

Abstract: Recently, Zaremba et al. demonstrated that increasing inference-time
computation improves robustness in large proprietary reasoning LLMs. In this
paper, we first show that smaller-scale, open-source models (e.g., DeepSeek R1,
Qwen3, Phi-reasoning) can also benefit from inference-time scaling using a
simple budget forcing strategy. More importantly, we reveal and critically
examine an implicit assumption in prior work: intermediate reasoning steps are
hidden from adversaries. By relaxing this assumption, we identify an important
security risk, intuitively motivated and empirically verified as an inverse
scaling law: if intermediate reasoning steps become explicitly accessible,
increased inference-time computation consistently reduces model robustness.
Finally, we discuss practical scenarios where models with hidden reasoning
chains are still vulnerable to attacks, such as models with tool-integrated
reasoning and advanced reasoning extraction attacks. Our findings collectively
demonstrate that the robustness benefits of inference-time scaling depend
heavily on the adversarial setting and deployment context. We urge
practitioners to carefully weigh these subtle trade-offs before applying
inference-time scaling in security-sensitive, real-world applications.

### [12] [Micromobility Flow Prediction: A Bike Sharing Station-level Study via Multi-level Spatial-Temporal Attention Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16020)
*Xi Yang,Jiachen Wang,Song Han,Suining He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BikeMAN is a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network that predicts bike station-level traffic for entire bike sharing systems, achieving high accuracy on NYC bike sharing data with over 10 million trips across 700+ stations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban bike sharing systems face challenges due to unbalanced station-level demand and supply, making system maintenance difficult. Existing efforts focus on traffic prediction but struggle with spatial-temporal complexity and the scale of predicting across entire systems with many stations.

Method: The authors propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network with an encoder-decoder architecture. It incorporates two attention mechanisms: one for spatial correlation between bike station features and another for temporal characteristics of bike station traffic.

Result: The network demonstrated high accuracy in predicting bike station traffic for all stations in New York City, validated on over 10 million trips across more than 700 bike stations in the bike sharing system.

Conclusion: BikeMAN successfully addresses the challenge of station-level bike traffic prediction for entire bike sharing systems by effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies through attention mechanisms, enabling better system efficiency and maintenance.

Abstract: Efficient use of urban micromobility resources such as bike sharing is
challenging due to the unbalanced station-level demand and supply, which causes
the maintenance of the bike sharing systems painstaking. Prior efforts have
been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and
return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level
traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of
bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike
sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations.
To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention
neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing
systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an
attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of
bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the
temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on
over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York
City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic
of all stations in the city.

### [13] [From Logic to Language: A Trust Index for Problem Solving with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16028)
*Tehseen Rug,Felix BÃ¶hmer,Tessa Pfattheicher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework to understand the fundamental differences between classical formal computation and Large Language Models (LLMs) in problem-solving, introducing metrics to evaluate the quality of solutions in ambiguous, subjective domains that LLMs can address but classical systems cannot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical computation excels at problems with unambiguous rules but fails to address a vast range of human problems characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments, and subjective context. The advent of LLMs enables computational engagement with these previously inaccessible domains, necessitating new frameworks to understand and evaluate these different problem-solving paradigms.

Method: The authors develop a unified framework that defines and delineates problem spaces addressable by formal versus natural language. They introduce a vector-valued trust index Q to measure solution quality, distinguishing binary correctness of formal solutions from the continuous adequacy spectrum of natural language solutions. Two statistical quality dimensions are proposed: normalized bi-semantic entropy (measuring robustness and conceptual diversity) and emotional valence (quantifying subjective valuation).

Result: The framework successfully distinguishes between formal language problems (evaluated with binary quality measures) and natural language problems (requiring nuanced evaluation accounting for vagueness, subjectivity, and ambiguity). The vector-valued trust index Q and the two statistical quality dimensions provide quantifiable metrics for evaluating LLM solution quality in ambiguous domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a more rigorous understanding of the capabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the LLM era, offering tools to evaluate and compare classical formal computation with natural language-based problem-solving approaches.

Abstract: Classical computation, grounded in formal, logical systems, has been the
engine of technological progress for decades, excelling at problems that can be
described with unambiguous rules. This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean
of human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments,
and subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language
Models (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to
engage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This
paper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these
problem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces
addressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the
former problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter
requires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking
into account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural
language. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects
solution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions
from the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language
solutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality
dimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual
diversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.
Emotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable
metric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures. The concepts
introduced in this work will provide a more rigorous understanding of the
capabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the age of
LLMs.

### [14] [A Unifying Framework for Semiring-Based Constraint Logic Programming With Negation (full version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16067)
*Jeroen Spaans,Jesse Heyninck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified extension of Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) that allows negation in clause bodies and uses semiring theory to unify various existing CLP extensions like fuzzy constraints and uncertainty handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLP extensions (fuzzy constraints, uncertainty, negation) have been developed separately using different semiring notions, but none allow negation in clause bodies. There's a need for a unifying framework that captures these approaches while supporting more expressive language features.

Method: The authors use approximation fixpoint theory to provide semantics for CLP programs with negation in clause bodies, and analyze how different semiring properties affect the resulting semantics to create a unifying framework.

Result: The paper successfully develops a unified framework that captures existing CLP extensions and enables them to support negation in clause bodies, providing detailed analysis of how semiring properties impact the semantics.

Conclusion: The work provides a unifying framework for CLP extensions that allows for more expressive language capabilities by supporting negation in clause bodies, while maintaining theoretical soundness through approximation fixpoint theory.

Abstract: Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a logic programming formalism used to
solve problems requiring the consideration of constraints, like resource
allocation and automated planning and scheduling. It has previously been
extended in various directions, for example to support fuzzy constraint
satisfaction, uncertainty, or negation, with different notions of semiring
being used as a unifying abstraction for these generalizations. None of these
extensions have studied clauses with negation allowed in the body. We
investigate an extension of CLP which unifies many of these extensions and
allows negation in the body. We provide semantics for such programs, using the
framework of approximation fixpoint theory, and give a detailed overview of the
impacts of properties of the semirings on the resulting semantics. As such, we
provide a unifying framework that captures existing approaches and allows
extending them with a more expressive language.

*Shengchao Liu,Hannan Xu,Yan Ai,Huanxin Li,Yoshua Bengio,Harry Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatBattery is an AI framework that uses large language models with chain-of-thought reasoning and domain knowledge to discover new battery materials, successfully identifying three novel lithium-ion cathode materials with 18-29% capacity improvements over existing materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs with chain-of-thought techniques have shown success in math and coding, their potential for domain-specific applications like battery discovery remains largely unexplored. The authors were inspired by the idea that reasoning mirrors guided search and saw an opportunity to apply LLM reasoning to materials design.

Method: The authors developed ChatBattery, an agentic framework that integrates domain knowledge to guide LLMs toward more effective reasoning in materials design. The framework implements a complete AI-driven cycle from design to synthesis to characterization of battery materials.

Result: ChatBattery successfully identified, synthesized, and characterized three novel lithium-ion battery cathode materials that achieved practical capacity improvements of 28.8%, 25.2%, and 18.5% respectively over the widely used NMC811 cathode material.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that LLM-driven reasoning can be successfully applied to materials discovery, establishing a new AI-driven platform for battery materials invention and showing the transformative potential of AI reasoning in revolutionizing materials discovery beyond traditional math and coding applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques to
tackle complex problems, representing a transformative breakthrough in
artificial intelligence (AI). However, their reasoning capabilities have
primarily been demonstrated in solving math and coding problems, leaving their
potential for domain-specific applications-such as battery discovery-largely
unexplored. Inspired by the idea that reasoning mirrors a form of guided
search, we introduce ChatBattery, a novel agentic framework that integrates
domain knowledge to steer LLMs toward more effective reasoning in materials
design. Using ChatBattery, we successfully identify, synthesize, and
characterize three novel lithium-ion battery cathode materials, which achieve
practical capacity improvements of 28.8%, 25.2%, and 18.5%, respectively, over
the widely used cathode material, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811). Beyond this
discovery, ChatBattery paves a new path by showing a successful LLM-driven and
reasoning-based platform for battery materials invention. This complete
AI-driven cycle-from design to synthesis to characterization-demonstrates the
transformative potential of AI-driven reasoning in revolutionizing materials
discovery.

### [16] [TaxCalcBench: Evaluating Frontier Models on the Tax Calculation Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16126)
*Michael R. Bock,Kara Molisee,Zachary Ozer,Sumit Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces TaxCalcBench, a benchmark to evaluate AI models' ability to calculate US personal income taxes, finding that state-of-the-art models succeed in less than one-third of cases due to errors in tax table usage, calculations, and eligibility determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the question of whether AI can handle complex real-world tasks like tax filing, which requires understanding vast amounts of English text and performing careful computations. Current capabilities of LLMs in this domain are unclear.

Method: The researchers created TaxCalcBench, a benchmark dataset for evaluating models' abilities to calculate personal income tax returns when provided with all necessary information. They tested state-of-the-art models on this simplified sample set and analyzed their performance patterns.

Result: State-of-the-art models achieved success rates of less than one-third on federal income tax return calculations. The analysis revealed consistent failure patterns: models frequently misuse tax tables, make computational errors, and incorrectly determine tax eligibility criteria.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate significant limitations in current LLMs for tax calculation tasks and highlight the need for additional infrastructure and improvements before LLMs can be reliably applied to personal income tax calculations.

Abstract: Can AI file your taxes? Not yet. Calculating US personal income taxes is a
task that requires building an understanding of vast amounts of English text
and using that knowledge to carefully compute results. We propose TaxCalcBench,
a benchmark for determining models' abilities to calculate personal income tax
returns given all of the necessary information. Our experiment shows that
state-of-the-art models succeed in calculating less than a third of federal
income tax returns even on this simplified sample set. Our analysis concludes
that models consistently misuse tax tables, make errors in tax calculation, and
incorrectly determine eligibility. Our findings point to the need for
additional infrastructure to apply LLMs to the personal income tax calculation
task.

### [17] [SpiroLLM: Finetuning Pretrained LLMs to Understand Spirogram Time Series with Clinical Validation in COPD Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16145)
*Shuhao Mei,Yongchao Long,Shan Cao,Xiaobo Han,Shijia Geng,Jinbo Sun,Yuxi Zhou,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SpiroLLM is the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirograms for COPD diagnosis, combining respiratory curve analysis with LLM capabilities to generate comprehensive diagnostic reports with 89.8% AUROC accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for COPD diagnosis lack explainability and only provide classification results without rationale, while existing LLMs cannot understand spirograms, limiting clinical trust and adoption in respiratory disease diagnosis.

Method: The model uses a SpiroEncoder to extract morphological features from respiratory curves, aligns them with PFT numerical values using a SpiroProjector in a unified latent space, and integrates this with a large language model to generate comprehensive diagnostic reports. Training was conducted on 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank.

Result: SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132) and maintained 100% valid response rate in robustness tests with missing data, significantly outperforming text-only models (13.4% valid response rate).

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of integrating physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools in respiratory disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory
disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of
disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely
collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the
early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over
time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to
outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their
diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot
understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and
adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals
from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large
language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological
features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT
numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately
empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic
report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC
of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data,
it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a
text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This
work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological
signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next
generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.

### [18] [Emergent Cognitive Convergence via Implementation: A Structured Loop Reflecting Four Theories of Mind (A Position Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16184)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers discovered that their AI agent architecture (Agentic Flow) unintentionally converged with four major theories of mind (Kahneman's dual-system, Friston's predictive processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind), achieving 95.8% task success vs 62.3% for baseline LLMs, and propose PEACE as a meta-architecture to describe these emergent structural patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by limitations in large language models (LLMs) and seeks to understand how practical AI agent design choices can lead to structural convergence with established cognitive theories, rather than top-down theoretical implementation.

Method: The researchers designed Agentic Flow, a five-module AI architecture (Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, Action) arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop, then conducted comparative experiments with baseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks to assess performance and theoretical alignment.

Result: Agentic Flow achieved 95.8% task success rate with strong constraint adherence compared to 62.3% for baseline systems. The architecture retrospectively aligned with computational motifs from four influential theories of mind, including predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that theoretical structures can emerge through practical design choices rather than deliberate top-down implementation. The authors introduce PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture and position this as exploratory work showing how implementation can surface latent structural echoes of cognitive theory without claiming theoretical unification.

Abstract: We report the discovery of a structural convergence across four influential
theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive
processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind-emerging
unintentionally within a practical AI agent architecture called Agentic Flow.
Designed to address limitations in large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow
comprises five interdependent modules such as Retrieval, Cognition, Control,
Memory, and Action arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop. Although originally
inspired only by Minsky and Clark, the system's structure retrospectively
aligns with computational motifs found in all four theories, including
predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.
  To assess this convergence, we conducted comparative experiments with
baseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks. The structured agent
achieved 95.8% task success and exhibited strong constraint adherence, while
the baseline system succeeded 62.3% of the time. These results were not aimed
at proving superiority, but at illustrating how theoretical structures may
emerge through practical design choices rather than top-down theory.
  We introduce PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that captures
design-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow. Not intended as a new
theory, PEACE provides a shared vocabulary for understanding architectures
shaped by real-world implementation demands. This paper should be read as a
position paper - an exploratory reflection on how implementation can surface
latent structural echoes of cognitive theory, without asserting theoretical
unification.

### [19] [CHIMERA: Compressed Hybrid Intelligence for Twin-Model Enhanced Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Functional RIS-Assisted Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16204)
*Li-Hsiang Shen,Jyun-Jhe Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) enhanced with multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) that can reflect, amplify, and harvest energy. A novel CHIMERA deep reinforcement learning framework is developed to optimize the complex system parameters for maximizing long-term energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses energy shortages in low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in shadowed regions and the need for energy-efficient optimization in complex multi-layer network architectures that integrate space, air, and ground components with advanced reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.

Method: The authors develop CHIMERA (Compressed Hybrid Intelligence for Twin-model Enhanced Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning), which integrates semantic state-action compression and parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to jointly optimize MF-RIS parameters (signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, active element selection) and SAGIN parameters (beamforming, HAPS deployment, user association, computing capability).

Result: Simulation results show that the proposed CHIMERA scheme significantly outperforms conventional benchmarks including fixed-configuration MF-RIS, traditional RIS, no-RIS cases, and other deep reinforcement learning baselines in terms of energy efficiency. The SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture achieves superior performance compared to standalone satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.

Conclusion: The proposed SAGIN architecture empowered by MF-RIS and optimized through the CHIMERA framework successfully addresses energy challenges in multi-layer networks, demonstrating substantial improvements in energy efficiency through complementary coverage and intelligent resource optimization across space, air, and ground components.

Abstract: A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture is proposed,
empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS)
capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless
energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of
low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in shadowed regions, while
explicitly accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption
across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE), we
formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including
signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element
selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude
platform station (HAPS) deployment, user association, and computing capability.
The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed
discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid
intelligence for twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and
parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore
suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the
proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks,
including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and
no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed
SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture achieves superior EE performance due to its
complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone
satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.

### [20] [Distilled Large Language Model in Confidential Computing Environment for System-on-Chip Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16226)
*Dong Ben,Hui Feng,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for circuit design, finding that distilled and quantized models can run efficiently in secure environments, with DeepSeek models showing superior performance in resource-constrained TEE implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in circuit design but require protection of confidential intellectual property (IP) including trained models and training data. Existing TEE implementations are not optimized for resource-intensive LLMs, creating a need to evaluate and optimize LLM performance within secure computing environments.

Method: The authors conducted comprehensive experiments comparing LLM performance across three environments: TEE-based (Intel TDX), CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations. They evaluated various models including distilled models (DeepSeek) and quantized models (4-bit and 8-bit quantization) measuring performance in tokens per second. Results were validated using a testbench for SoC design tasks.

Result: Distilled models like DeepSeek outperformed other models due to smaller parameter counts. Quantized models (Q4 and Q8) achieved up to 3x performance gains compared to FP16 models. For smaller parameter sets like DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperformed CPU-only versions while maintaining security. The approach successfully demonstrated efficient deployment of lightweight LLMs in resource-constrained secure environments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of deploying lightweight LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained systems within secure TEE environments for semiconductor CAD applications. Distilled and quantized models offer promising solutions for maintaining both performance and security in confidential computing scenarios for circuit design tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in circuit design tasks
and have typically undergone multiple rounds of training. Both the trained
models and their associated training data are considered confidential
intellectual property (IP) and must be protected from exposure. Confidential
Computing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, existing TEE implementations
are not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently.
In this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a
TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel
Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three
environments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and
evaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second.
  Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other
models in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for
resource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit
quantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain
of up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer
parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms
the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We
further validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks.
These validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying
lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD
applications.

*Bo Wen,Chen Wang,Qiwei Han,Raquel Norel,Julia Liu,Thaddeus Stappenbeck,Jeffrey L. Rogers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents Agent PULSE, an LLM-powered voice assistant for healthcare monitoring, demonstrating through a pilot study with 33 IBD patients that AI voice agents can provide cost-effective healthcare services with 70% patient acceptance, offering potential for bridging accessibility gaps in underserved populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to bridge economic and accessibility gaps in digital health delivery, particularly for underserved populations where human healthcare intervention is economically unfeasible, using voice-based AI agents as a transformative solution.

Method: The authors developed Agent PULSE (Patient Understanding and Liaison Support Engine) through collaboration between IBM Research, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and Morehouse School of Medicine, conducted a pilot study with 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients, and created an economic model to analyze cost-effectiveness of AI-driven healthcare services.

Result: The pilot study showed 70% patient acceptance of AI-driven monitoring, with 37% preferring it over traditional modalities. The cost-utility analysis demonstrated significant potential savings for routine monitoring tasks, while technical challenges in real-time processing, system integration, and privacy compliance were identified.

Conclusion: Voice-based AI agents can enhance healthcare scalability, efficiency, patient engagement, and accessibility. When properly aligned with ethical and regulatory frameworks and addressing current technical limitations, these agents can serve as critical entry points for equitable and sustainable digital healthcare solutions.

Abstract: The integration of voice-based AI agents in healthcare presents a
transformative opportunity to bridge economic and accessibility gaps in digital
health delivery. This paper explores the role of large language model
(LLM)-powered voice assistants in enhancing preventive care and continuous
patient monitoring, particularly in underserved populations. Drawing insights
from the development and pilot study of Agent PULSE (Patient Understanding and
Liaison Support Engine) -- a collaborative initiative between IBM Research,
Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and Morehouse School of Medicine -- we present an
economic model demonstrating how AI agents can provide cost-effective
healthcare services where human intervention is economically unfeasible. Our
pilot study with 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients revealed that 70\%
expressed acceptance of AI-driven monitoring, with 37\% preferring it over
traditional modalities. Technical challenges, including real-time
conversational AI processing, integration with healthcare systems, and privacy
compliance, are analyzed alongside policy considerations surrounding
regulation, bias mitigation, and patient autonomy. Our findings suggest that
AI-driven voice agents not only enhance healthcare scalability and efficiency
but also improve patient engagement and accessibility. For healthcare
executives, our cost-utility analysis demonstrates huge potential savings for
routine monitoring tasks, while technologists can leverage our framework to
prioritize improvements yielding the highest patient impact. By addressing
current limitations and aligning AI development with ethical and regulatory
frameworks, voice-based AI agents can serve as a critical entry point for
equitable, sustainable digital healthcare solutions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ResearcherBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Deep AI Research Systems (DARS) on frontier AI scientific research questions, featuring 65 expert-selected questions across 35 AI subjects with a dual evaluation framework combining rubric and factual assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks only evaluate AI research systems as agents for web retrieval and report generation, overlooking their potential to discover novel insights on the frontiers of scientific research. There was a need for a standardized evaluation platform specifically focused on assessing advanced AI systems' capabilities in conducting frontier AI scientific research.

Method: The authors compiled a dataset of 65 research questions from real-world scientific scenarios (laboratory discussions and interviews) spanning 35 AI subjects, categorized into three types: technical details, literature review, and open consulting. They developed a dual evaluation framework combining rubric assessment (expert-designed criteria for insight quality) and factual assessment (citation accuracy and coverage).

Result: OpenAI Deep Research and Gemini Deep Research significantly outperformed other commercial DARS and baseline systems, with particular strength in open-ended consulting questions. The evaluation demonstrated these systems' capabilities represent a meaningful step toward AI self-improvement.

Conclusion: ResearcherBench provides a standardized platform for evaluating next-generation AI research assistants on frontier scientific questions, fostering a new perspective in AI research evaluation and enabling a novel pattern of scientific collaboration between humans and AI systems.

Abstract: The emergence of deep research systems presents significant capabilities in
problem-solving, extending from basic queries to sophisticated research tasks.
However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate these systems as agents for web
retrieval and report generation, overlooking their potential to discover novel
insights on the frontiers of scientific research. To address this gap, we
introduce ResearcherBench, the first benchmark focused on evaluating the
capabilities of these advanced, agentic systems - which we refer to as Deep AI
Research Systems (DARS) - on frontier AI scientific questions. We compiled a
dataset of 65 research questions expertly selected from real-world scientific
scenarios such as laboratory discussions and interviews, spanning 35 different
AI subjects and categorized into three types: technical details, literature
review, and open consulting. Our dual evaluation framework combines rubric
assessment, which uses expert-designed criteria to evaluate insight quality,
with factual assessment, which measures citation accuracy (faithfulness) and
coverage (groundedness). We evaluated several leading commercial DARS and
baseline systems. Results show that OpenAI Deep Research and Gemini Deep
Research significantly outperform other systems, with particular strength in
open-ended consulting questions. Such capabilities represent a meaningful step
toward AI self-improvement, aligning with the vision of ASI for AI. We
open-source ResearcherBench to provide a standardized platform for promoting
the development of next-generation AI research assistants, hoping to foster a
new perspective in AI research evaluation for a novel pattern of scientific

### [23] [Cross-Modal Distillation For Widely Differing Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16296)
*Cairong Zhao,Yufeng Jin,Zifan Song,Haonan Chen,Duoqian Miao,Guosheng Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cross-modal distillation framework that uses soft constraints and quality-based adaptive weighting to transfer knowledge from multi-modal teacher models to single-modal student models, addressing the challenge of limited multi-modal data access during deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning performance improvement through model scaling is becoming inefficient. Multi-modal learning can provide richer information but faces the challenge of limited multi-modal data availability during actual use. Existing cross-modal knowledge distillation suffers from overfitting due to large domain gaps between different modalities.

Method: The authors develop a cross-modal distillation framework with: (1) soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at both feature and classifier levels to replace hard constraints like L2 loss that cause overfitting, and (2) a quality-based adaptive weights module that quantifies data quality to assign appropriate weights to input samples for robust training.

Result: Experiments on speaker recognition and image classification tasks demonstrate effective knowledge transfer between image, text, and speech modalities. The proposed soft constraints and adaptive weighting successfully mitigate overfitting issues in cross-modal distillation.

Conclusion: The cross-modal distillation framework with soft constraints and quality-based adaptive weighting effectively transfers discriminative knowledge from multi-modal teachers to single-modal students, enabling robust cross-modal learning despite domain gaps between modalities.

Abstract: Deep learning achieved great progress recently, however, it is not easy or
efficient to further improve its performance by increasing the size of the
model. Multi-modal learning can mitigate this challenge by introducing richer
and more discriminative information as input. To solve the problem of limited
access to multi-modal data at the time of use, we conduct multi-modal learning
by introducing a teacher model to transfer discriminative knowledge to a
student model during training. However, this knowledge transfer via
distillation is not trivial because the big domain gap between the widely
differing modalities can easily lead to overfitting. In this work, we introduce
a cross-modal distillation framework. Specifically, we find hard constrained
loss, e.g. l2 loss forcing the student being exact the same as the teacher, can
easily lead to overfitting in cross-modality distillation. To address this, we
propose two soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at the feature
level and classifier level respectively. In addition, we propose a
quality-based adaptive weights module to weigh input samples via quantified
data quality, leading to robust model training. We conducted experiments on
speaker recognition and image classification tasks, and the results show that
our approach is able to effectively achieve knowledge transfer between the
commonly used and widely differing modalities of image, text, and speech.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study reveals that existing medical LLM benchmarks poorly represent African disease burdens and healthcare contexts, and introduces Alama Health QA - a new benchmark based on Kenyan clinical guidelines that better captures neglected tropical diseases and regional healthcare needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical LLM benchmarks primarily reflect high-income country disease profiles and examination syllabi, potentially making them invalid for African healthcare deployment where diseases like malaria, HIV, TB, and sickle cell disease dominate the burden and national guidelines drive clinical care.

Method: The researchers systematically reviewed 31 quantitative LLM evaluation papers to identify 19 English medical QA benchmarks, developed Alama Health QA using retrieval augmented generation anchored on Kenyan Clinical Practice Guidelines, and conducted harmonized semantic profiling and blinded expert evaluation of six benchmark sets across clinical relevance, guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and cultural fit.

Result: Alama Health QA captured >40% of all neglected tropical disease mentions and showed highest frequencies for malaria (7.7%), HIV (4.1%), and TB (5.2%) compared to other benchmarks. Global benchmarks showed minimal representation of African diseases, with sickle cell disease absent in three major sets. Alama scored highest for clinical relevance and guideline alignment in expert evaluation.

Conclusion: Current medical LLM benchmarks significantly underrepresent African disease burdens and regulatory contexts, creating risks for misleading performance claims. Guideline-anchored, regionally curated resources like Alama Health QA are essential for safe and equitable AI model evaluation and deployment in African health systems.

Abstract: Introduction: Existing medical LLM benchmarks largely reflect examination
syllabi and disease profiles from high income settings, raising questions about
their validity for African deployment where malaria, HIV, TB, sickle cell
disease and other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) dominate burden and
national guidelines drive care. Methodology: We systematically reviewed 31
quantitative LLM evaluation papers (Jan 2019 May 2025) identifying 19 English
medical QA benchmarks. Alama Health QA was developed using a retrieval
augmented generation framework anchored on the Kenyan Clinical Practice
Guidelines. Six widely used sets (AfriMedQA, MMLUMedical, PubMedQA, MedMCQA,
MedQAUSMLE, and guideline grounded Alama Health QA) underwent harmonized
semantic profiling (NTD proportion, recency, readability, lexical diversity
metrics) and blinded expert rating across five dimensions: clinical relevance,
guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and language/cultural
fit. Results: Alama Health QA captured >40% of all NTD mentions across corpora
and the highest within set frequencies for malaria (7.7%), HIV (4.1%), and TB
(5.2%); AfriMedQA ranked second but lacked formal guideline linkage. Global
benchmarks showed minimal representation (e.g., sickle cell disease absent in
three sets) despite large scale. Qualitatively, Alama scored highest for
relevance and guideline alignment; PubMedQA lowest for clinical utility.
Discussion: Quantitative medical LLM benchmarks widely used in the literature
underrepresent African disease burdens and regulatory contexts, risking
misleading performance claims. Guideline anchored, regionally curated resources
such as Alama Health QA and expanded disease specific derivatives are essential
for safe, equitable model evaluation and deployment across African health
systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Higher Gauge Flow Models, which extend ordinary Gauge Flow Models using Lâ-algebra to incorporate higher geometry and higher symmetries, demonstrating improved performance on Gaussian Mixture Model datasets compared to traditional Flow Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Generative Flow Models by extending beyond ordinary Gauge Flow Models through the integration of higher geometry and higher symmetries associated with higher groups, leveraging the mathematical framework of Lâ-algebra to capture more complex structural relationships.

Method: The paper develops Higher Gauge Flow Models by building upon ordinary Gauge Flow Models and incorporating Lâ-algebra as an extension of Lie Algebra. This mathematical framework enables the integration of higher geometry and higher symmetries from higher groups into the generative flow modeling framework.

Result: Experimental evaluation on a Gaussian Mixture Model dataset demonstrated substantial performance improvements of the proposed Higher Gauge Flow Models compared to traditional Flow Models.

Conclusion: Higher Gauge Flow Models successfully extend the capabilities of ordinary Gauge Flow Models by incorporating higher-order mathematical structures through Lâ-algebra, resulting in improved generative modeling performance and opening new possibilities for leveraging higher geometry in machine learning applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces Higher Gauge Flow Models, a novel class of Generative
Flow Models. Building upon ordinary Gauge Flow Models (arXiv:2507.13414), these
Higher Gauge Flow Models leverage an L$_{\infty}$-algebra, effectively
extending the Lie Algebra. This expansion allows for the integration of the
higher geometry and higher symmetries associated with higher groups into the
framework of Generative Flow Models. Experimental evaluation on a Gaussian
Mixture Model dataset revealed substantial performance improvements compared to
traditional Flow Models.

*Arpan Dasgupta,Mizhaan Maniyar,Awadhesh Srivastava,Sanat Kumar,Amrita Mahale,Aparna Hedge,Arun Suggala,Karthikeyan Shanmugam,Aparna Taneja,Milind Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study developed and tested a collaborative bandit algorithm to optimize call timing for India's Kilkari maternal health program, showing statistically significant improvements in call pick-up rates compared to random scheduling among 6,500 participants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current random call scheduling in India's Kilkari maternal health program often results in missed calls and reduced message delivery to mothers, limiting the effectiveness of this mobile health intervention that serves millions of mothers with vital maternal health information.

Method: A collaborative bandit algorithm was designed to learn individual mothers' preferred call times and optimize call scheduling. The algorithm was deployed in a field trial with approximately 6,500 Kilkari participants, comparing its performance against the baseline random calling approach.

Result: The bandit algorithm achieved statistically significant improvement in call pick-up rates compared to the random scheduling baseline, demonstrating better message delivery effectiveness.

Conclusion: Personalized scheduling through machine learning can significantly enhance mobile health interventions. The collaborative bandit algorithm shows potential to improve maternal health outreach at scale, potentially benefiting millions of mothers across India by increasing the delivery of crucial health information.

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) programs utilize automated voice messages to deliver
health information, particularly targeting underserved communities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of using mobile technology to disseminate
crucial health information to these populations, improving health outcomes
through increased awareness and behavioral change. India's Kilkari program
delivers vital maternal health information via weekly voice calls to millions
of mothers. However, the current random call scheduling often results in missed
calls and reduced message delivery. This study presents a field trial of a
collaborative bandit algorithm designed to optimize call timing by learning
individual mothers' preferred call times. We deployed the algorithm with around
$6500$ Kilkari participants as a pilot study, comparing its performance to the
baseline random calling approach. Our results demonstrate a statistically
significant improvement in call pick-up rates with the bandit algorithm,
indicating its potential to enhance message delivery and impact millions of
mothers across India. This research highlights the efficacy of personalized
scheduling in mobile health interventions and underscores the potential of
machine learning to improve maternal health outreach at scale.

### [27] [Canonical Representations of Markovian Structural Causal Models: A Framework for Counterfactual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16370)
*Lucas de Lara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes counterfactual models as an alternative to structural causal models for representing counterfactual reasoning in Pearl's causal framework, allowing analysts to choose different counterfactual conceptions without altering observational and interventional constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many counterfactual statements cannot be falsified even by randomized experiments, yet they underpin fundamental concepts like individual-wise fairness. There's a need for better models to formalize and implement counterfactual beliefs in causal reasoning, particularly in Pearl's Markovian causal framework.

Method: The authors introduce counterfactual models (canonical representations of structural causal models) that use random-process probability distributions with preassigned marginals to characterize counterfactual equivalence classes. They also present a normalization procedure to describe and implement various counterfactual conceptions.

Result: The proposed counterfactual models allow specification of many counterfactual conceptions without altering observational and interventional constraints. The counterfactual layer content doesn't need estimation - only requires making a choice. The approach is demonstrated on theoretical and numerical examples.

Conclusion: Counterfactual models provide a flexible alternative to structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning, enabling analysts to choose appropriate counterfactual conceptions while maintaining compatibility with causal graphical models and preserving observational/interventional constraints.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning aims at answering contrary-to-fact questions like
''Would have Alice recovered had she taken aspirin?'' and corresponds to the
most fine-grained layer of causation. Critically, while many counterfactual
statements cannot be falsified -- even by randomized experiments -- they
underpin fundamental concepts like individual-wise fairness. Therefore,
providing models to formalize and implement counterfactual beliefs remains a
fundamental scientific problem. In the Markovian setting of Pearl's causal
framework, we propose an alternative approach to structural causal models to
represent counterfactuals compatible with a given causal graphical model. More
precisely, we introduce counterfactual models, also called canonical
representations of structural causal models. They enable analysts to choose a
counterfactual conception via random-process probability distributions with
preassigned marginals and characterize the counterfactual equivalence class of
structural causal models. Then, we present a normalization procedure to
describe and implement various counterfactual conceptions. Compared to
structural causal models, it allows to specify many counterfactual conceptions
without altering the observational and interventional constraints. Moreover,
the content of the model corresponding to the counterfactual layer does not
need to be estimated; only to make a choice. Finally, we illustrate the
specific role of counterfactuals in causality and the benefits of our approach
on theoretical and numerical examples.

### [28] [LLM-Driven Collaborative Model for Untangling Commits via Explicit and Implicit Dependency Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16395)
*Bo Hou,Xin Tan,Kai Zheng,Fang Liu,Yinghao Zhu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ColaUntangle is a multi-agent LLM framework that uses collaborative consultation to untangle commits by modeling both explicit and implicit dependencies, achieving 44-100% improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers frequently create tangled commits that mix unrelated changes, which negatively impacts code review and maintenance. Existing commit untangling approaches rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish between explicit dependencies (control/data flow) and implicit ones (semantic/conceptual relationships).

Method: ColaUntangle uses a multi-agent LLM architecture with three agents: one specializing in explicit dependencies, another in implicit dependencies, and a reviewer agent that synthesizes their perspectives through iterative consultation. The framework constructs multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG) to capture both symbolic and semantic contextual information.

Result: ColaUntangle was evaluated on two datasets (1,612 C# and 14k Java tangled commits) and outperformed the best baseline with 44% improvement on C# dataset and 100% improvement on Java dataset.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit untangling tasks by effectively modeling both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes.

Abstract: Atomic commits, each of which addresses a single development concern, are a
best practice in software development. However, developers frequently produce
tangled commits that mix unrelated changes due to practical constraints or
unclear boundaries, negatively impacting code review and maintenance. Although
prior commit untangling approaches: rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based,
have made progress, they often rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish
between explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) and implicit ones
(e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose
ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling
that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes.
ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a
multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies,
another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives
through iterative consultation. To capture explicit and implicit contextual
information, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG),
enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and
semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C#
and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle
outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on
the C# dataset and 100% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the
potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit
untangling tasks.

### [29] [Self-Supervised Inductive Logic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16405)
*Stassa Patsantzis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Poker, a new Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) system that can learn recursive logic programs from only positive examples without requiring expert-selected negative examples or problem-specific background theories, automatically generating training examples during learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ILP approaches like MIL require carefully curated negative examples and problem-specific background theories with expert knowledge. This limits their applicability when such resources are unavailable, creating a need for self-supervised learning methods that can work with minimal supervision.

Method: The authors develop a new MIL algorithm implemented in Prolog called Poker that learns from positive labeled examples and unlabeled data, automatically generating and labeling new positive and negative examples during training. They introduce Second Order Definite Normal Form (SONF) for principled selection of general second-order background theories.

Result: Poker outperforms the state-of-the-art Louise system on grammar learning tasks for Context-Free and L-System languages. Poker's performance improves with more automatically generated examples, while Louise over-generalizes without negative examples. The approach successfully learns from just terminal vocabulary and positive example strings.

Conclusion: The self-supervised ILP setting enables learning recursive logic programs without expert-curated negative examples or problem-specific background theories. The automatic example generation approach in Poker provides a viable solution for ILP in scenarios with limited supervision, demonstrating improved generalization compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) approaches like Meta \-/ Interpretive
Learning (MIL) can learn, from few examples, recursive logic programs with
invented predicates that generalise well to unseen instances. This ability
relies on a background theory and negative examples, both carefully selected
with expert knowledge of a learning problem and its solutions. But what if such
a problem-specific background theory or negative examples are not available? We
formalise this question as a new setting for Self-Supervised ILP and present a
new MIL algorithm that learns in the new setting from some positive labelled,
and zero or more unlabelled examples, and automatically generates, and labels,
new positive and negative examples during learning. We implement this algorithm
in Prolog in a new MIL system, called Poker. We compare Poker to
state-of-the-art MIL system Louise on experiments learning grammars for
Context-Free and L-System languages from labelled, positive example strings, no
negative examples, and just the terminal vocabulary of a language, seen in
examples, as a first-order background theory. We introduce a new approach for
the principled selection of a second-order background theory as a Second Order
Definite Normal Form (SONF), sufficiently general to learn all programs in a
class, thus removing the need for a backgound theory tailored to a learning
task. We find that Poker's performance improves with increasing numbers of
automatically generated examples while Louise, bereft of negative examples,
over-generalises.

### [30] [Identifying Pre-training Data in LLMs: A Neuron Activation-Based Detection Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16414)
*Hongyi Tang,Zhihao Zhu,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces NA-PDD, a novel algorithm for detecting whether specific data was included in large language models' pre-training by analyzing differential neuron activation patterns, significantly outperforming existing methods that rely on superficial features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face legal and ethical concerns due to copyrighted material and private information in training data, plus issues with dataset contamination and bias internalization. Existing Pre-Training Data Detection (PDD) methods perform poorly because they rely on superficial features like prediction confidence and loss rather than deeper analysis.

Method: The authors propose NA-PDD (Neuron Activation-based Pre-Training Data Detection), which analyzes differential neuron activation patterns between training and non-training data during LLM inference. They also introduce CCNewsPDD, a temporally unbiased benchmark with rigorous data transformations to ensure consistent time distributions between training and non-training data.

Result: NA-PDD significantly outperforms existing PDD methods across three benchmarks and multiple LLMs, demonstrating superior performance in identifying whether specific data was included in pre-training corpora.

Conclusion: The differential neuron activation approach provides a more effective solution for pre-training data detection compared to existing superficial feature-based methods, offering better tools to address legal, ethical, and quality concerns in LLM development.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to their
training data, which can include copyrighted material or private information,
raising legal and ethical concerns. Additionally, LLMs face criticism for
dataset contamination and internalizing biases. To address these issues, the
Pre-Training Data Detection (PDD) task was proposed to identify if specific
data was included in an LLM's pre-training corpus. However, existing PDD
methods often rely on superficial features like prediction confidence and loss,
resulting in mediocre performance. To improve this, we introduce NA-PDD, a
novel algorithm analyzing differential neuron activation patterns between
training and non-training data in LLMs. This is based on the observation that
these data types activate different neurons during LLM inference. We also
introduce CCNewsPDD, a temporally unbiased benchmark employing rigorous data
transformations to ensure consistent time distributions between training and
non-training data. Our experiments demonstrate that NA-PDD significantly
outperforms existing methods across three benchmarks and multiple LLMs.

### [31] [From model-based learning to model-free behaviour with Meta-Interpretive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16434)
*Stassa Patsantzis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid autonomous agent that combines model-based and model-free capabilities by using Meta-Interpretive Learning to train a model-based Solver, which then trains a model-free Controller that can solve the same planning problems without requiring complete environment observation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents need to operate independently in novel environments, but existing approaches are limited: model-based agents can plan but require complete environment knowledge, while model-free agents can act without full observation but cannot plan ahead. There's a need for agents that combine both capabilities to handle diverse, unknown environments effectively.

Method: The authors use Meta-Interpretive Learning to create a model-based Solver that learns to understand the environment and plan actions. This Solver is then used to train a model-free Controller that can solve the same planning problems as the Solver but without requiring a complete model or full environment observation. The approach creates equivalent problem-solving capabilities across both agent types.

Result: The researchers demonstrated equivalence between the model-based Solver and model-free Controller on grid navigation problems across two environment types: randomly generated mazes and lake maps with wide open areas. All navigation problems solved by the Solver were also successfully solved by the Controller, confirming their equivalent problem-solving abilities.

Conclusion: The study successfully shows that it's possible to create autonomous agents that combine model-based planning capabilities with model-free execution abilities. The equivalence demonstrated between the Solver and Controller indicates that agents can maintain planning effectiveness while gaining the flexibility to operate without complete environment knowledge, making them more suitable for real-world autonomous applications.

Abstract: A "model" is a theory that describes the state of an environment and the
effects of an agent's decisions on the environment. A model-based agent can use
its model to predict the effects of its future actions and so plan ahead, but
must know the state of the environment. A model-free agent cannot plan, but can
act without a model and without completely observing the environment. An
autonomous agent capable of acting independently in novel environments must
combine both sets of capabilities. We show how to create such an agent with
Meta-Interpretive Learning used to learn a model-based Solver used to train a
model-free Controller that can solve the same planning problems as the Solver.
We demonstrate the equivalence in problem-solving ability of the two agents on
grid navigation problems in two kinds of environment: randomly generated mazes,
and lake maps with wide open areas. We find that all navigation problems solved
by the Solver are also solved by the Controller, indicating the two are
equivalent.

### [32] [Improving ASP-based ORS Schedules through Machine Learning Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16454)
*Pierangela Bruno,Carmine Dodaro,Giuseppe GalatÃ ,Marco Maratea,Marco Mochi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper combines machine learning and Answer Set Programming (ASP) to solve Operating Room Scheduling problems by predicting surgery durations and generating more robust provisional schedules using confidence-based encoding updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASP-based solutions for operating room scheduling can only verify schedules against actual data and suggest alternatives, but cannot generate provisional schedules or ensure robustness. There's a need to integrate predictive capabilities with deductive reasoning to create practical scheduling systems.

Method: The authors integrate inductive and deductive techniques: (1) Use machine learning algorithms to predict surgery durations from historical data for provisional schedule computation, (2) Incorporate prediction confidence as additional input to the ASP encoding, (3) Update the encoding to compute more robust schedules based on uncertainty quantification.

Result: The integrated approach successfully generates provisional schedules and improves robustness. Results on historical data from ASL1 Liguria in Italy demonstrate the viability of combining machine learning predictions with ASP-based scheduling optimization.

Conclusion: The integration of machine learning for duration prediction with ASP-based optimization effectively addresses the limitations of purely deductive approaches, enabling provisional schedule generation and improved robustness in operating room scheduling systems.

Abstract: The Operating Room Scheduling (ORS) problem deals with the optimization of
daily operating room surgery schedules. It is a challenging problem subject to
many constraints, like to determine the starting time of different surgeries
and allocating the required resources, including the availability of beds in
different department units. Recently, solutions to this problem based on Answer
Set Programming (ASP) have been delivered. Such solutions are overall
satisfying but, when applied to real data, they can currently only verify
whether the encoding aligns with the actual data and, at most, suggest
alternative schedules that could have been computed. As a consequence, it is
not currently possible to generate provisional schedules. Furthermore, the
resulting schedules are not always robust.
  In this paper, we integrate inductive and deductive techniques for solving
these issues. We first employ machine learning algorithms to predict the
surgery duration, from historical data, to compute provisional schedules. Then,
we consider the confidence of such predictions as an additional input to our
problem and update the encoding correspondingly in order to compute more robust
schedules. Results on historical data from the ASL1 Liguria in Italy confirm
the viability of our integration.

*Chang Li,Yaren Zhang,Haoran Lv,Qiong Cao,Chao Xue,Xiaodong He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for efficient implicit reasoning in LLMs by modeling latent thoughts as hierarchical reinforcement learning options, avoiding the computational cost of explicit Chain-of-Thought text generation while maintaining reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models with Chain-of-Thought prompting show strong reasoning but are computationally expensive and slow due to explicit step-by-step text generation. The authors aim to develop efficient implicit reasoning where models "think" in latent space without generating text for every reasoning step.

Method: The approach models latent thoughts as temporally-extended abstract actions (options) in hierarchical reinforcement learning. Key components include: (1) Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC) algorithm using variational inference for learning diverse option libraries, (2) extended theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms to provide theoretical foundation, and (3) cold-start procedure using supervised fine-tuning data to distill human reasoning into latent option space.

Result: Extensive experiments show strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness for learning abstract skills in both language and control domains.

Conclusion: The framework successfully provides a principled method for learning abstract reasoning skills that maintains optimality while being computationally more efficient than explicit Chain-of-Thought approaches, validated across both language reasoning and control tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through
explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step
textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this,
we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the
model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every
step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as
temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical
reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of
options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian
Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference
within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these
options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP
homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract
latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the
solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start
procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human
reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich
initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical
reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework
as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and
control.

### [34] [ACT: Bridging the Gap in Code Translation through Synthetic Data Generation & Adaptive Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16478)
*Shreya Saxena,Siva Prasad,Zishan Ahmad,Vishal Vaddina*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACT is an automated framework that improves code translation by fine-tuning open-source LLMs using synthetic data generation, dynamic hyperparameter adjustment, and execution-level evaluation, providing a secure alternative to proprietary solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional code translation methods rely on inflexible handcrafted rules, while advanced language models are often proprietary and raise data security concerns. There's a need for an open-source solution that can match the performance of closed-source alternatives while maintaining data security and accessibility.

Method: ACT employs an automated pipeline with three key components: (1) a synthetic data generation module that creates high-quality datasets from initial code samples with unit tests, (2) an evaluation framework with execution-level checks, and (3) a controller module that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters and orchestrates iterative data generation and fine-tuning based on real-time evaluations.

Result: ACT consistently enhances the effectiveness of open-source models, narrowing the performance gap with closed-source solutions. The framework has been successfully applied to industry-scale migration projects, resulting in notable increases in developer acceleration.

Conclusion: ACT provides businesses and developers with a secure, reliable, and accessible alternative to proprietary code translation solutions by enabling effective fine-tuning of open-source LLMs through automated synthetic data generation and intelligent pipeline management.

Abstract: Code translation is a crucial process in software development and migration
projects, enabling interoperability between different programming languages and
enhancing software adaptability and thus longevity. Traditional automated
translation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which
often lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models
present promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based
implementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this
paper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative
framework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling
in-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's
automated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models,
narrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of
closed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation
module, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code
samples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.
ACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a
comprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its
controller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting
hyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based
on real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to
continue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the
process. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the
effectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a
secure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation
pipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in
developer acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RAG systems fail on complex queries in knowledge-intensive domains, providing only limited extractive answers and struggling with multiple targeted retrievals or navigating intricate entity relationships, creating a critical gap in specialized scientific fields.

Method: The paper introduces INRAExplorer, which employs an LLM-based agent with multi-tool architecture that dynamically engages a rich knowledge base through a comprehensive knowledge graph derived from open access INRAE publications, enabling iterative and targeted queries.

Result: INRAExplorer successfully conducts iterative, targeted queries, retrieves exhaustive datasets (such as all publications by an author), performs multi-hop reasoning, and delivers structured, comprehensive answers for scientific data exploration.

Conclusion: INRAExplorer demonstrates how agentic RAG systems can enhance knowledge interaction in specialized fields by overcoming the limitations of conventional RAG through sophisticated agent-based architectures and comprehensive knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) but often fall short on complex queries, delivering
limited, extractive answers and struggling with multiple targeted retrievals or
navigating intricate entity relationships. This is a critical gap in
knowledge-intensive domains. We introduce INRAExplorer, an agentic RAG system
for exploring the scientific data of INRAE (France's National Research
Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment). INRAExplorer employs an
LLM-based agent with a multi-tool architecture to dynamically engage a rich
knowledge base, through a comprehensive knowledge graph derived from open
access INRAE publications. This design empowers INRAExplorer to conduct
iterative, targeted queries, retrieve exhaustive datasets (e.g., all

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive risk assessment framework for frontier AI models, evaluating seven critical risk areas using color-coded zones (green/yellow/red) based on threat thresholds, finding that current AI models remain in manageable to moderate risk zones without crossing critical red lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI models poses unprecedented risks that need systematic identification and assessment. There is an urgent need for a structured framework to understand and categorize these frontier risks to enable appropriate risk management and deployment decisions.

Method: The authors employ the E-T-C analysis framework (deployment environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk Management Framework v1.0. They define risk zones using "red lines" (intolerable thresholds) and "yellow lines" (early warning indicators), creating a three-tier system: green (manageable), yellow (controlled deployment needed), and red (suspension required). Seven critical risk areas are evaluated: cyber offense, biological/chemical risks, persuasion/manipulation, uncontrolled AI R&D, strategic deception, self-replication, and collusion.

Result: All recent frontier AI models remain in green and yellow zones without crossing red lines. No models cross yellow lines for cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R&D. Most models stay in green zones for self-replication and strategic deception, except some reasoning models in yellow. Most models fall in yellow zones for persuasion/manipulation due to effective human influence capabilities. For biological/chemical risks, most models potentially reside in yellow zones, though further assessment is needed.

Conclusion: Current frontier AI models present manageable to moderate risks across evaluated categories, with no models reaching critical threat levels. However, the assessment highlights areas requiring continued monitoring and strengthened mitigations, particularly in persuasion/manipulation and biological/chemical domains. The work calls for collective action to address these evolving AI safety challenges.

Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing
artificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive
assessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment
environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk
Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks
in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and
manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\&D, strategic deception and
scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the "AI-$45^\circ$ Law,"
we evaluate these risks using "red lines" (intolerable thresholds) and "yellow
lines" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk
for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring
strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating
suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that
all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without
crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for
cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\&D risks. For self-replication, and
strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except
for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and
manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective
influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule
out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although
detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further
claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and
urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

### [37] [Novel Multi-Agent Action Masked Deep Reinforcement Learning for General Industrial Assembly Lines Balancing Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16635)
*Ali Mohamed Ali,Luca Tirel,Hashim A. Hashim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach using Markov Decision Process modeling to optimize industrial assembly line scheduling, featuring action-masking and multi-agent techniques for improved training efficiency and real-time decision making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Integer Programming solutions for assembly line planning become computationally infeasible for large-scale scenarios, while heuristic methods like Genetic Algorithms often produce suboptimal solutions. There's a need for an efficient, scalable approach that can handle complex industrial assembly line optimization without restrictive assumptions.

Method: The paper formulates a generic industrial assembly line as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents for optimization. Two key innovations are introduced: (1) an action-masking technique to ensure only feasible actions are selected, and (2) a multi-agent approach where each workstation has its own agent. A centralized training with decentralized execution framework is adopted for scalable learning.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed DRL approach achieves significantly faster convergence to optimal solutions compared to comparable model-based approaches. The action-masking and multi-agent techniques successfully reduce training time and computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL framework with MDP modeling, action-masking, and multi-agent architecture provides an effective solution for industrial assembly line optimization that is both computationally efficient and scalable, offering real-time decision making capabilities through offline-trained neural networks.

Abstract: Efficient planning of activities is essential for modern industrial assembly
lines to uphold manufacturing standards, prevent project constraint violations,
and achieve cost-effective operations. While exact solutions to such challenges
can be obtained through Integer Programming (IP), the dependence of the search
space on input parameters often makes IP computationally infeasible for
large-scale scenarios. Heuristic methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, can also
be applied, but they frequently produce suboptimal solutions in extensive
cases. This paper introduces a novel mathematical model of a generic industrial
assembly line formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), without imposing
assumptions on the type of assembly line a notable distinction from most
existing models. The proposed model is employed to create a virtual environment
for training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to optimize task and
resource scheduling. To enhance the efficiency of agent training, the paper
proposes two innovative tools. The first is an action-masking technique, which
ensures the agent selects only feasible actions, thereby reducing training
time. The second is a multi-agent approach, where each workstation is managed
by an individual agent, as a result, the state and action spaces were reduced.
A centralized training framework with decentralized execution is adopted,
offering a scalable learning architecture for optimizing industrial assembly
lines. This framework allows the agents to learn offline and subsequently
provide real-time solutions during operations by leveraging a neural network
that maps the current factory state to the optimal action. The effectiveness of
the proposed scheme is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating
significantly faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to a
comparable model-based approach.

### [38] [Adaptive Inventory Strategies using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Agri-Food Supply Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16670)
*Amandeep Kaur,Gyan Prakash*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study proposes a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm that combines value-based and policy-based approaches to optimize inventory management in agri-food supply chains under demand and lead time uncertainties, addressing seasonal fluctuations and perishability while maximizing overall supply chain profitability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural products face seasonal production and demand fluctuations, leading to inventory management challenges including excess inventory or stockouts. Existing literature lacks consideration of coordination among stakeholders across different levels of the food supply chain, and traditional approaches struggle with uncertainties and product shelf-life constraints.

Method: The study develops a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm that combines benefits of both value-based and policy-based DRL approaches. The algorithm uses continuous action space for optimal order quantity selection and incorporates a shared optimization goal to incentivize stakeholder collaboration while simultaneously considering perishability, demand uncertainty, and lead time uncertainty.

Result: Experimental results using empirical data from fresh agricultural products supply chain demonstrate improved performance of the proposed inventory replenishment policy under stochastic demand patterns and lead time scenarios. The algorithm effectively addresses inventory optimization challenges and maximizes profitability throughout the agri-food supply chain.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL-based inventory management approach successfully handles uncertainties in agri-food supply chains while promoting stakeholder collaboration. The research provides managerial implications for policymakers to more effectively manage agricultural product inventories under uncertainty, offering a practical solution to complex inventory optimization problems in perishable goods supply chains.

Abstract: Agricultural products are often subject to seasonal fluctuations in
production and demand. Predicting and managing inventory levels in response to
these variations can be challenging, leading to either excess inventory or
stockouts. Additionally, the coordination among stakeholders at various level
of food supply chain is not considered in the existing body of literature. To
bridge these research gaps, this study focuses on inventory management of
agri-food products under demand and lead time uncertainties. By implementing
effective inventory replenishment policy results in maximize the overall profit
throughout the supply chain. However, the complexity of the problem increases
due to these uncertainties and shelf-life of the product, that makes
challenging to implement traditional approaches to generate optimal set of
solutions. Thus, the current study propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) algorithm that combines the benefits of both value- and policy-based DRL
approaches for inventory optimization under uncertainties. The proposed
algorithm can incentivize collaboration among stakeholders by aligning their
interests and objectives through shared optimization goal of maximizing
profitability along the agri-food supply chain while considering perishability,
and uncertainty simultaneously. By selecting optimal order quantities with
continuous action space, the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the
inventory optimization challenges. To rigorously evaluate this algorithm, the
empirical data from fresh agricultural products supply chain inventory is
considered. Experimental results corroborate the improved performance of the
proposed inventory replenishment policy under stochastic demand patterns and
lead time scenarios. The research findings hold managerial implications for
policymakers to manage the inventory of agricultural products more effectively
under uncertainty.

*Ran Wang,Xiaoxuan Liu,Hao Ren,Gang Chen,Fanchao Qi,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces wgrammar, a lightweight decoding engine that achieves up to 250x speedup for structured output generation in large language models by decomposing constraints into static and dynamic components and using compositional operators instead of pushdown automata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structured decoding methods for LLMs suffer from efficiency bottlenecks due to grammar compilation, state tracking, and mask creation, which limits their practical application in downstream systems requiring specific output formats like HTML or JSON.

Method: The paper proposes decomposing constraints into static and dynamic components - precompiling static structures offline and instantiating dynamic arguments at runtime using grammar snippets. They replace pushdown automata with compositional operators to model regular formats and integrate domain-aware simplification, constraint decomposition, and mask caching.

Result: The wgrammar system achieves up to 250x speedup over existing structured decoding systems while maintaining the ability to generate outputs in required formats for downstream applications.

Conclusion: The proposed wgrammar engine successfully addresses efficiency bottlenecks in structured decoding by leveraging prior knowledge about output structure and using a novel constraint decomposition approach, resulting in significant performance improvements for LLM structured output generation.

Abstract: Structured decoding enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs
in formats required by downstream systems, such as HTML or JSON. However,
existing methods suffer from efficiency bottlenecks due to grammar compilation,
state tracking, and mask creation. We observe that many real-world tasks embed
strong prior knowledge about output structure. Leveraging this, we propose a
decomposition of constraints into static and dynamic components -- precompiling
static structures offline and instantiating dynamic arguments at runtime using
grammar snippets. Instead of relying on pushdown automata, we employ a
compositional set of operators to model regular formats, achieving lower
transition latency. We introduce wgrammar, a lightweight decoding engine that
integrates domain-aware simplification, constraint decomposition, and mask
caching, achieving up to 250x speedup over existing systems. wgrammar's source

### [41] [ChatChecker: A Framework for Dialogue System Testing and Evaluation Through Non-cooperative User Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16792)
*Roman Mayr,Michel Schimpf,Thomas BohnÃ©*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatChecker is an automated framework for testing complex dialogue systems that uses LLMs to simulate diverse user interactions and detect dialogue breakdowns, improving upon previous approaches by not requiring reference dialogues and including error taxonomy and non-cooperative user personas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern dialogue systems integrate multiple LLMs, external tools, and databases, making them complex systems that need holistic evaluation beyond just testing the underlying LLM. Previous work focused mainly on turn-level analysis rather than integrated dialogue-level quality assurance, creating a major challenge for comprehensive testing of these complex systems.

Method: ChatChecker uses LLMs to simulate diverse user interactions, identify dialogue breakdowns, and evaluate quality. The framework includes an error taxonomy in prompts to improve breakdown detection and proposes a novel non-cooperative user simulator based on challenging personas. The design is generalizable and decoupled from target system implementation, requiring no reference dialogues.

Result: ChatChecker improves breakdown detection performance over prior LLM-based approaches by incorporating error taxonomy. The non-cooperative user simulator with challenging personas more effectively uncovers weaknesses in dialogue systems compared to previous methods. The framework reduces setup effort while being generalizable across different dialogue system implementations.

Conclusion: ChatChecker enables thorough and scalable testing of complex dialogue systems, contributing to the acceleration of robust dialogue system development for both researchers and practitioners. The framework addresses the gap in dialogue-level quality assurance by providing automated evaluation without requiring reference dialogues or system-specific implementation details.

Abstract: While modern dialogue systems heavily rely on large language models (LLMs),
their implementation often goes beyond pure LLM interaction. Developers
integrate multiple LLMs, external tools, and databases. Therefore, assessment
of the underlying LLM alone does not suffice, and the dialogue systems must be
tested and evaluated as a whole. However, this remains a major challenge. With
most previous work focusing on turn-level analysis, less attention has been
paid to integrated dialogue-level quality assurance. To address this, we
present ChatChecker, a framework for automated evaluation and testing of
complex dialogue systems. ChatChecker uses LLMs to simulate diverse user
interactions, identify dialogue breakdowns, and evaluate quality. Compared to
previous approaches, our design reduces setup effort and is generalizable, as
it does not require reference dialogues and is decoupled from the
implementation of the target dialogue system. We improve breakdown detection
performance over a prior LLM-based approach by including an error taxonomy in
the prompt. Additionally, we propose a novel non-cooperative user simulator
based on challenging personas that uncovers weaknesses in target dialogue
systems more effectively. Through this, ChatChecker contributes to thorough and
scalable testing. This enables both researchers and practitioners to accelerate
the development of robust dialogue systems.

### [42] [Uncertainty-Aware Knowledge Transformers for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16796)
*Mian Ibad Ali Shah,Enda Barrett,Karl Mason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel P2P energy trading framework that combines uncertainty-aware prediction using a Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) model and multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize trading strategies while explicitly accounting for prediction uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current P2P energy trading systems rely on deterministic forecasts which fail to account for prediction uncertainty, creating a critical gap in robust decision-making for the stochastic environment of energy trading. There is a need for uncertainty-aware approaches that can better handle risk and variability in energy markets.

Method: The framework integrates a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The KTU model uses domain-specific features and a custom loss function to provide reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals. These uncertainty-aware predictions are then integrated into a Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework to enable agents to optimize trading strategies with explicit risk understanding.

Result: The uncertainty-aware DQN achieved significant improvements: reduced energy purchase costs by 5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, increased electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7% respectively, and reduced peak hour grid demand by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P trading. The benefits were more pronounced when P2P trading was enabled.

Conclusion: The integration of uncertainty-aware forecasting with multi-agent reinforcement learning creates synergistic effects that significantly improve the economic efficiency and resilience of energy communities. The approach demonstrates that explicitly modeling prediction uncertainty leads to better trading decisions and enhanced performance, particularly when combined with P2P trading mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading
that integrates uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL), addressing a critical gap in current literature. In contrast
to previous works relying on deterministic forecasts, the proposed approach
employs a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model
called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) to explicitly quantify
prediction uncertainty, which is essential for robust decision-making in the
stochastic environment of P2P energy trading. The KTU model leverages
domain-specific features and is trained with a custom loss function that
ensures reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals for each
prediction. Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL
framework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear
understanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the
uncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to
5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing
electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak
hour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These
improvements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting
the synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient,
economically efficient energy communities.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect 1 in 10 Americans, yet standard ICD coding systems fail
to capture these conditions in electronic health records (EHR), leaving crucial

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The concept of hypernetworks (neural networks that generate other neural networks) has been understudied due to lack of available research resources and datasets specifically designed for hypernetwork research purposes.

Method: Generated a dataset of 10,000 LeNet-5 neural networks using a computing cluster of over 10,000 cores, with networks trained for binary image classification and organized into 10 classes (1,000 networks per class) where each class can identify a specific ImageNette V2 class from all others.

Result: The dataset successfully enables neural network classification with 72.0% accuracy, demonstrating that differences between neural networks can be identified by supervised machine learning algorithms. The dataset and generation code are made publicly accessible.

Conclusion: The created dataset provides a valuable research resource for hypernetwork studies, proving that neural networks can be effectively classified and opening new possibilities for research in networks that generate other networks.

Abstract: Despite the transformative potential of AI, the concept of neural networks
that can produce other neural networks by generating model weights
(hypernetworks) has been largely understudied. One of the possible reasons is
the lack of available research resources that can be used for the purpose of
hypernetwork research. Here we describe a dataset of neural networks, designed
for the purpose of hypernetworks research. The dataset includes $10^4$ LeNet-5
neural networks trained for binary image classification separated into 10
classes, such that each class contains 1,000 different neural networks that can
identify a certain ImageNette V2 class from all other classes. A computing
cluster of over $10^4$ cores was used to generate the dataset. Basic
classification results show that the neural networks can be classified with
accuracy of 72.0%, indicating that the differences between the neural networks
can be identified by supervised machine learning algorithms. The ultimate
purpose of the dataset is to enable hypernetworks research. The dataset and the
code that generates it are open and accessible to the public.

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) methods in real-world commercial settings and introduces APE-OPRO, a hybrid framework that improves cost-efficiency by 18% over OPRO while maintaining performance for multiclass classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt design for Large Language Models remains largely heuristic, manual, and difficult to scale. Most existing APO frameworks have only been validated on benchmark classification tasks of limited complexity, creating a critical gap for real-world, high-stakes commercial applications.

Result: APE-OPRO achieves around 18% improvement in cost-efficiency over OPRO without sacrificing performance. ProTeGi offers the strongest absolute performance at lower API cost but higher computational time. The study reveals notable sensitivity to label formatting and provides insights into trade-offs between performance, API efficiency, and scalability.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable insights for implementing APO in commercial applications and establish a foundation for future research in multi-label, vision, and multimodal prompt optimization scenarios. The work demonstrates that hybrid approaches can effectively balance performance and efficiency in real-world settings.

  We introduce APE-OPRO, a novel hybrid framework that combines the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a method that reduces the factorization error in Discrete Flow-based Models to enable efficient few-step generation while maintaining high-quality discrete data synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete Flow-based Models suffer from slow sampling speeds due to their reliance on iterative decoding processes, which stems from factorization approximation necessary for handling high-dimensional data. The paper aims to address this few-step generation challenge.

Method: The authors propose Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), an iterative method that reduces factorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target distributions. They use Conditional Total Correlation (TC) to characterize approximation error and design ReDi to monotonically decrease Conditional TC in each step.

Result: ReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation. The rectified couplings are well-suited for training efficient one-step models on image generation, demonstrating improved sampling efficiency while maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: ReDi provides a theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge in discrete flow models, offering a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis with guaranteed convergence properties.

Abstract: Discrete Flow-based Models (DFMs) are powerful generative models for
high-quality discrete data but typically suffer from slow sampling speeds due
to their reliance on iterative decoding processes. This reliance on a
multi-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs,
which is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we
rigorously characterize the approximation error from factorization using
Conditional Total Correlation (TC), which depends on the coupling. To reduce
the Conditional TC and enable efficient few-step generation, we propose
Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces
factorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target
distributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a
monotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically,
ReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for
training efficient one-step models on image generation. ReDi offers a simple
and theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge,
providing a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis. Code is

TL;DR: A decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for mapping deep neural networks to hardware that improves sample efficiency by 30-300x over single-agent RL while achieving significant latency and energy reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping DNNs to hardware is critical for optimizing performance but faces challenges with vast and complex mapping spaces. Traditional reinforcement learning approaches suffer from sample inefficiency, limiting their effectiveness in this domain.

Method: A decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework with an agent clustering algorithm that assigns similar mapping parameters to the same agents based on correlation analysis, enabling parallelized learning while avoiding training inefficiencies.

Result: The MARL approach achieves 30-300x improvement in sample efficiency compared to standard single-agent RL, with up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product (EDP) reduction under iso-sample conditions.

Conclusion: The decentralized MARL framework with agent clustering successfully addresses sample inefficiency in DNN-to-hardware mapping optimization, providing substantial improvements in both learning efficiency and hardware performance metrics.

Abstract: Mapping deep neural networks (DNNs) to hardware is critical for optimizing
latency, energy consumption, and resource utilization, making it a cornerstone
of high-performance accelerator design. Due to the vast and complex mapping
space, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach-but its
effectiveness is often limited by sample inefficiency. We present a
decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to
overcome this challenge. By distributing the search across multiple agents, our
framework accelerates exploration. To avoid inefficiencies from training
multiple agents in parallel, we introduce an agent clustering algorithm that
assigns similar mapping parameters to the same agents based on correlation
analysis. This enables a decentralized, parallelized learning process that
significantly improves sample efficiency. Experimental results show our MARL
approach improves sample efficiency by 30-300x over standard single-agent RL,
achieving up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product (EDP)
reduction under iso-sample conditions.

### [49] [Improving the Generation of VAEs with High Dimensional Latent Spaces by the use of Hyperspherical Coordinates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15900)
*Alejandro Ascarate,Leo Lebrat,Rodrigo Santa Cruz,Clinton Fookes,Olivier Salvado*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of poor generation quality in VAEs when sampling from random latent vectors by proposing hyperspherical coordinates to compress latent vectors towards a concentrated region on the hypersphere, reducing latent sparsity and improving generation ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VAEs suffer from poor generation quality when decoding random latent vectors from the prior, especially in high-dimensional latent spaces (>12 dimensions). The authors identify that latent vectors are distributed uniformly on a hypersphere, leading to latent sparsity issues that hurt generation performance.

Method: The authors propose reformulating VAE latent variables using hyperspherical coordinates instead of standard Cartesian coordinates. This parameterization allows compressing latent vectors towards an "island" on the hypersphere, concentrating the latent distribution in a more meaningful region with limited computational overhead.

Result: The hyperspherical parameterization reduces latent sparsity and demonstrates improved generation ability compared to standard VAEs. The method achieves better generation quality when sampling random latent vectors while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: By leveraging insights from high-dimensional statistics and using hyperspherical coordinates, VAEs can overcome the latent sparsity problem that plagues generation from random samples. This approach provides a practical solution to improve VAE generation quality with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent
vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, decoding a
random latent vector from the prior usually does not produce meaningful data,
at least when the latent space has more than a dozen dimensions. In this paper,
we investigate this issue by drawing insight from high dimensional statistics:
in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are by construction
distributed uniformly on a hypersphere. We propose to formulate the latent
variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing
the latent vectors towards an island on the hypersphere, thereby reducing the
latent sparsity and we show that this improves the generation ability of the
VAE. We propose a new parameterization of the latent space with limited
computational overhead.

*Siyuan Liu,Wenjing Liu,Zhiwei Xu,Xin Wang,Bo Chen,Tao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HalMit is a black-box watchdog framework that detects hallucinations in LLM-powered intelligent agents by modeling their generalization bounds using probabilistic fractal sampling, without requiring access to the LLM's internal architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-powered intelligent agents suffer from hallucinations that undermine their credibility and pose catastrophic risks in real-world deployment. Existing hallucination detection approaches either require white-box access to LLMs or fail to accurately identify hallucinations, making effective black-box detection crucial for agent dependability.

Method: The paper proposes HalMit, a black-box watchdog framework that models the generalization bound of LLM-empowered agents to detect hallucinations. It uses a probabilistic fractal sampling technique to generate sufficient parallel queries that trigger problematic responses, efficiently identifying the target agent's generalization bound without internal LLM knowledge.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that HalMit significantly outperforms existing approaches in hallucination monitoring. The framework demonstrates superior performance while maintaining its black-box nature, making it effective for detecting hallucinations without requiring internal access to LLM architectures.

Conclusion: HalMit provides a promising black-box solution for enhancing the dependability of LLM-powered systems by effectively detecting hallucinations. Its superior performance and black-box design make it suitable for real-world deployment where internal LLM access is not available, addressing the critical challenge of agent reliability.

Abstract: Empowered by large language models (LLMs), intelligent agents have become a
popular paradigm for interacting with open environments to facilitate AI
deployment. However, hallucinations generated by LLMs-where outputs are
inconsistent with facts-pose a significant challenge, undermining the
credibility of intelligent agents. Only if hallucinations can be mitigated, the
intelligent agents can be used in real-world without any catastrophic risk.
Therefore, effective detection and mitigation of hallucinations are crucial to
ensure the dependability of agents. Unfortunately, the related approaches
either depend on white-box access to LLMs or fail to accurately identify
hallucinations. To address the challenge posed by hallucinations of intelligent
agents, we present HalMit, a novel black-box watchdog framework that models the
generalization bound of LLM-empowered agents and thus detect hallucinations
without requiring internal knowledge of the LLM's architecture. Specifically, a
probabilistic fractal sampling technique is proposed to generate a sufficient
number of queries to trigger the incredible responses in parallel, efficiently
identifying the generalization bound of the target agent. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that HalMit significantly outperforms existing
approaches in hallucination monitoring. Its black-box nature and superior
performance make HalMit a promising solution for enhancing the dependability of
LLM-powered systems.

Abstract: Visual Assessment of Cluster Tendency (VAT) is a widely used unsupervised
technique to assess the presence of cluster structure in unlabeled datasets.
However, its standard implementation suffers from significant performance
limitations due to its O(n^2) time complexity and inefficient memory usage. In

### [53] [Towards Reliable, Uncertainty-Aware Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15906)
*Debangshu Banerjee,Kintan Saha,Aditya Gopalan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a variance-aware policy optimization framework for LLM alignment that incorporates reward model uncertainty to achieve more stable and robust alignment compared to standard methods that rely on single reward model estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods that optimize policies against single reward models are vulnerable to reward model inaccuracies. The authors observe substantial disagreement between independently trained reward models on the same preference data, highlighting instability in existing alignment strategies and the risk of overfitting that can lead to performance degradation.

Method: The authors develop a variance-aware policy optimization framework that includes a new policy regularizer incorporating reward model variance estimates. This framework accounts for uncertainty in reward model training rather than relying on a single reward model estimate during policy optimization.

Result: Experiments across diverse LLM and reward model configurations demonstrate that the variance-aware approach yields more stable and robust alignment compared to standard variance-unaware pipelines. The method provably reduces the risk of outputting worse policies than the default baseline.

Conclusion: Incorporating reward model variance into policy optimization significantly improves the stability and robustness of LLM alignment. The proposed variance-aware framework provides theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence for better alignment outcomes compared to traditional single reward model approaches.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) typically involves training a
reward model on preference data, followed by policy optimization with respect
to the reward model. However, optimizing policies with respect to a single
reward model estimate can render it vulnerable to inaccuracies in the reward
model. We empirically study the variability of reward model training on
open-source benchmarks. We observe that independently trained reward models on
the same preference dataset can exhibit substantial disagreement, highlighting
the instability of current alignment strategies. Employing a theoretical model,
we demonstrate that variability in reward model estimation can cause
overfitting, leading to the risk of performance degradation. To mitigate this
risk, we propose a variance-aware policy optimization framework for
preference-based alignment. The key ingredient of the framework is a new policy
regularizer that incorporates reward model variance estimates. We show that
variance-aware policy optimization provably reduces the risk of outputting a
worse policy than the default. Experiments across diverse LLM and reward model
configurations confirm that our approach yields more stable and robust
alignment than the standard (variance-unaware) pipeline.

### [54] [Dual Turing Test: A Framework for Detecting and Mitigating Undetectable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15907)
*Alberto Messina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a "dual Turing test" framework that flips the traditional test by having human judges identify AI rather than reward deception, combining adversarial classification with quality constraints and reinforcement learning alignment to create undetectable yet high-quality AI outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge three important areas - adversarial AI detection, formal game theory with quality guarantees, and RL alignment - by creating a unified framework that addresses the challenge of developing AI systems that are both undetectable and maintain high output quality, moving beyond traditional Turing test paradigms.

Method: The method formalizes a dual Turing test as a two-player zero-sum game where judges try to identify AI over N rounds with fresh prompts, introduces quality functions with threshold parameters (tau and delta), maps this to an RL-HF alignment loop using an undetectability detector for negative rewards balanced by quality proxies, and employs phased difficulty levels with minimax bounds for worst-case guarantees.

Result: The paper presents a theoretical framework that combines quality thresholds, phased difficulty levels, and minimax bounds in a novel way, successfully mapping adversarial classification games onto RL alignment pipelines with explicit undetectability detectors and quality preservation mechanisms.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by establishing a unified framework that bridges adversarial AI detection, formal game theory, and RL alignment, providing a foundation for developing AI systems that are simultaneously undetectable and high-quality, with suggestions for immediate implementation actions.

Abstract: In this short note, we propose a unified framework that bridges three areas:
(1) a flipped perspective on the Turing Test, the "dual Turing test", in which
a human judge's goal is to identify an AI rather than reward a machine for
deception; (2) a formal adversarial classification game with explicit quality
constraints and worst-case guarantees; and (3) a reinforcement learning (RL)
alignment pipeline that uses an undetectability detector and a set of quality
related components in its reward model. We review historical precedents, from
inverted and meta-Turing variants to modern supervised reverse-Turing
classifiers, and highlight the novelty of combining quality thresholds, phased
difficulty levels, and minimax bounds. We then formalize the dual test: define
the judge's task over N independent rounds with fresh prompts drawn from a
prompt space Q, introduce a quality function Q and parameters tau and delta,
and cast the interaction as a two-player zero-sum game over the adversary's
feasible strategy set M. Next, we map this minimax game onto an RL-HF style
alignment loop, in which an undetectability detector D provides negative reward
for stealthy outputs, balanced by a quality proxy that preserves fluency.
Throughout, we include detailed explanations of each component notation, the
meaning of inner minimization over sequences, phased tests, and iterative
adversarial training and conclude with a suggestion for a couple of immediate
actions.

### [55] [HyDRA: A Hybrid-Driven Reasoning Architecture for Verifiable Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15917)
*Adrian Kaiser,Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei,Ryan Gold,Marius-Constantin Dinu,Markus Hofmarcher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyDRA is a hybrid neurosymbolic architecture that automates reliable Knowledge Graph construction by using collaborative agents to build ontologies with competency questions and verifiable contracts to guide LLM-based triplet extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated KG construction faces significant challenges with output reliability, consistency, and verifiability, including structural inconsistencies like isolated data islands and incorrect conflation of abstract classes with specific instances, which hinders the advancement of neurosymbolic AI.

Method: HyDRA employs collaborative neurosymbolic agents to construct ontologies by agreeing on competency questions (CQs), builds ontology graphs to guide triplet extraction, and uses design-by-contracts principles with verifiable contracts to control LLM generative processes for KG construction from documents.

Result: The approach produces more reliable and verifiable Knowledge Graphs with improved structural consistency, and introduces an evaluation framework using symbolic verifications from the SymbolicAI framework to assess functional correctness beyond standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: HyDRA successfully addresses KG construction reliability issues through hybrid-driven architecture and provides both improved automated KG generation methods and novel evaluation approaches for measuring functional integrity of generated knowledge graphs.

Abstract: The synergy between symbolic knowledge, often represented by Knowledge Graphs
(KGs), and the generative capabilities of neural networks is central to
advancing neurosymbolic AI. A primary bottleneck in realizing this potential is
the difficulty of automating KG construction, which faces challenges related to
output reliability, consistency, and verifiability. These issues can manifest
as structural inconsistencies within the generated graphs, such as the
formation of disconnected $\textit{isolated islands}$ of data or the inaccurate
conflation of abstract classes with specific instances. To address these
challenges, we propose HyDRA, a $\textbf{Hy}$brid-$\textbf{D}$riven
$\textbf{R}$easoning $\textbf{A}$rchitecture designed for verifiable KG
automation. Given a domain or an initial set of documents, HyDRA first
constructs an ontology via a panel of collaborative neurosymbolic agents. These
agents collaboratively agree on a set of competency questions (CQs) that define
the scope and requirements the ontology must be able to answer. Given these
CQs, we build an ontology graph that subsequently guides the automated
extraction of triplets for KG generation from arbitrary documents. Inspired by
design-by-contracts (DbC) principles, our method leverages verifiable contracts
as the primary control mechanism to steer the generative process of Large
Language Models (LLMs). To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond
standard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the
functional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications
as described by the neurosymbolic AI framework, $\textit{SymbolicAI}$. This
work contributes a hybrid-driven architecture for improving the reliability of
automated KG construction and the exploration of evaluation methods for
measuring the functional integrity of its output. The code is publicly
available.

### [56] [On the transferability of Sparse Autoencoders for interpreting compressed models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15977)
*Suchit Gupte,Vishnu Kabir Chhabra,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how model compression affects interpretability in LLMs by studying Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), finding that SAEs from original models can interpret compressed models with minimal performance loss, and that pruning SAEs directly is as effective as retraining them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLMs face inference efficiency challenges due to their large scale, leading to various compression methods like pruning and quantization. However, the impact of these compression techniques on model interpretability remains unclear, particularly regarding how Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) - effective tools for decomposing model activation spaces - perform on compressed models.

Method: The researchers compare SAEs trained on original models versus compressed models, examining how well SAEs from original models can interpret compressed versions. They also investigate direct pruning of SAEs as an alternative to retraining them on compressed models.

Result: SAEs trained on original models can effectively interpret compressed models with only slight performance degradation compared to SAEs specifically trained on compressed models. Additionally, directly pruning the original SAE achieves comparable performance to training a completely new SAE on the pruned model.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that model compression does not severely impact interpretability when using SAEs, and that direct SAE pruning can replace costly retraining, significantly reducing the computational overhead of maintaining interpretability tools for compressed models.

Abstract: Modern LLMs face inference efficiency challenges due to their scale. To
address this, many compression methods have been proposed, such as pruning and
quantization. However, the effect of compression on a model's interpretability
remains elusive. While several model interpretation approaches exist, such as
circuit discovery, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven particularly
effective in decomposing a model's activation space into its feature basis. In
this work, we explore the differences in SAEs for the original and compressed
models. We find that SAEs trained on the original model can interpret the
compressed model albeit with slight performance degradation compared to the
trained SAE on the compressed model. Furthermore, simply pruning the original
SAE itself achieves performance comparable to training a new SAE on the pruned
model. This finding enables us to mitigate the extensive training costs of
SAEs.

*Kyung-hwan Lee,Kyung-tae Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAL-GP, a multi-layer Gaussian Process framework that mirrors neural network architecture to improve confidence calibration by capturing both local semantic dependencies and global calibration coherence through layerwise GP corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GP calibration methods fail to capture the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, which limits both interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability in neural network classifiers.

Method: The paper introduces Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that employs a multi-layer GP model where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration correction, coupled through a structured multi-layer kernel enabling joint marginalization across all layers.

Result: SAL-GP captures both local semantic dependencies and global calibration coherence while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the network, enhancing interpretability aligned with network architecture.

Conclusion: The SAL-GP framework enables principled evaluation of confidence consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models by mirroring the layered architecture of neural networks and providing better calibration than conventional single global GP correction methods.

Abstract: Calibrating the confidence of neural network classifiers is essential for
quantifying the reliability of their predictions during inference. However,
conventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods often fail to capture
the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, limiting both
interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability. We
propose a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that
mirrors the layered architecture of the target neural network. Instead of
applying a single global GP correction, SAL-GP employs a multi-layer GP model,
where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration
correction. These layerwise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer
kernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers. This design allows
SAL-GP to capture both local semantic dependencies and global calibration
coherence, while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the
network. The resulting framework enhances interpretability aligned with the
network architecture and enables principled evaluation of confidence
consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models.

*Yuzhi Liu,Zixuan Chen,Zirui Zhang,Yufei Liu,Giulia Lanzillotta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper conducts an empirical analysis of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) dynamics in continual learning settings, where data distributions change over time, revealing that static-kernel approximations may not be valid for continual learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous NTK research has been limited to single-task settings with constant data distributions. The authors aim to understand how NTK dynamics behave in continual learning scenarios where data distributions shift over time, which is crucial for understanding feature learning in more realistic settings.

Method: The paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of NTK dynamics specifically in continual learning environments, examining how the kernel evolves when the network faces changing data distributions over time rather than static single-task scenarios.

Result: The findings show that continual learning provides a rich testbed for studying neural training dynamics. The results challenge the validity of static-kernel approximations that are commonly used in theoretical treatments of continual learning, even when operating at large scale.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that continual learning scenarios reveal important limitations of current theoretical frameworks based on static NTK assumptions, suggesting that dynamic kernel evolution is essential for understanding neural networks in realistic, time-varying environments.

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) offers a powerful tool to study the
functional dynamics of neural networks. In the so-called lazy, or kernel
regime, the NTK remains static during training and the network function is
linear in the static neural tangents feature space. The evolution of the NTK
during training is necessary for feature learning, a key driver of deep
learning success. The study of the NTK dynamics has led to several critical
discoveries in recent years, in generalization and scaling behaviours. However,
this body of work has been limited to the single task setting, where the data
distribution is assumed constant over time. In this work, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of NTK dynamics in continual learning, where
the data distribution shifts over time. Our findings highlight continual
learning as a rich and underutilized testbed for probing the dynamics of neural
training. At the same time, they challenge the validity of static-kernel
approximations in theoretical treatments of continual learning, even at large
scale.

*Yuta Nakahara,Manabu Kobayashi,Toshiyasu Matsushima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical analysis of ternary neural networks (with parameters restricted to {-1, 0, +1}) by studying their expressivity through the number of linear regions, proving they achieve polynomial growth with width and exponential growth with depth similar to standard neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While ternary neural networks show excellent practical performance in applications like image recognition and NLP with reduced computational complexity and memory consumption, their theoretical understanding remains insufficient, particularly regarding their expressivity compared to standard neural networks.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze ternary neural networks' expressivity by evaluating the number of linear regions in ternary regression networks with ReLU activation functions, examining how this number scales with network width and depth.

Result: The paper proves that ternary neural networks' linear regions increase polynomially with network width and exponentially with depth, similar to standard neural networks. They show that squaring the width or doubling the depth of ternary networks can achieve comparable lower bounds on maximum linear regions as general ReLU regression networks.

Conclusion: The theoretical analysis provides mathematical justification for the practical success of ternary neural networks by demonstrating their expressivity is comparable to standard networks when appropriately scaled, offering insights into why these computationally efficient networks perform well in practice.

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning, reducing computational complexity and
memory consumption has become a critical challenge, and ternary neural networks
(NNs) that restrict parameters to $\{-1, 0, +1\}$ have attracted attention as a
promising approach. While ternary NNs demonstrate excellent performance in
practical applications such as image recognition and natural language
processing, their theoretical understanding remains insufficient. In this
paper, we theoretically analyze the expressivity of ternary NNs from the
perspective of the number of linear regions. Specifically, we evaluate the
number of linear regions of ternary regression NNs with Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU) for activation functions and prove that the number of linear regions
increases polynomially with respect to network width and exponentially with
respect to depth, similar to standard NNs. Moreover, we show that it suffices
to either square the width or double the depth of ternary NNs to achieve a
lower bound on the maximum number of linear regions comparable to that of
general ReLU regression NNs. This provides a theoretical explanation, in some
sense, for the practical success of ternary NNs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Data Weighting Model (DWM) that dynamically adjusts data weights during large language model training using bi-level optimization, improving upon static data selection methods by accounting for evolving model preferences throughout the training process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data selection methods for LLM training use static, training-agnostic criteria that fail to capture the dynamic interactions between models and data during training. There's a need for adaptive data selection that accounts for how model preferences evolve throughout the training process.

Method: The authors propose a Data Weighting Model (DWM) that uses bi-level optimization to dynamically adjust the weight of selected data within each training batch. The weighting model is updated to better capture the dynamic data preferences of the trained model as training progresses.

Result: DWM enhances performance of models trained with randomly-selected data. The learned weighting model is transferable and can improve other data selection methods and models of different sizes. The method provides insights into how model data preferences evolve during training.

Conclusion: Dynamic data weighting through DWM offers a more effective approach to data selection for LLM training compared to static methods, with the added benefits of transferability across different models and data selection approaches, while revealing important insights about evolving model preferences.

Abstract: While large-scale training data is fundamental for developing capable large
language models (LLMs), strategically selecting high-quality data has emerged
as a critical approach to enhance training efficiency and reduce computational
costs. Current data selection methodologies predominantly rely on static,
training-agnostic criteria, failing to account for the dynamic model training
and data interactions. In this paper, we propose a new Data Weighting Model
(DWM) to adjust the weight of selected data within each batch to achieve a
dynamic data utilization during LLM training. Specially, to better capture the
dynamic data preference of the trained model, a bi-level optimization framework
is implemented to update the weighting model. Our experiments demonstrate that
DWM enhances the performance of models trained with randomly-selected data, and
the learned weighting model can be transferred to enhance other data selection
methods and models of different sizes. Moreover, we further analyze how a
model's data preferences evolve throughout training, providing new insights
into the data preference of the model during training.

*Kaiyuan Li,Pengyu Wang,Yunshan Peng,Pengjia Yuan,Yanxiang Zeng,Rui Xiang,Yanhua Cheng,Xialong Liu,Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes EBaReT, a novel reinforcement learning approach for automated bidding that addresses data quality issues and reward uncertainty by using expert-guided learning and bag reward mechanisms to improve bidding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional automated bidding methods face challenges with low data quality due to sub-optimal bids and uncertain rewards from low click/conversion rates. Existing generative RL methods for bidding rely on supervised learning approaches that are vulnerable to these data quality issues, yet few studies have addressed these fundamental challenges.

Method: The paper introduces Expert-guided Bag Reward Transformer (EBaReT) which: 1) Generates expert trajectories as supplementary training data and uses PU learning-based discriminator to identify expert transitions, 2) Implements expert-guided inference strategy to ensure expert-level decisions, 3) Treats transitions within a period as a "bag" and designs a smoother reward function to mitigate reward uncertainty.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that EBaReT achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art automated bidding methods, effectively addressing both data quality and reward uncertainty issues.

Conclusion: The proposed EBaReT successfully tackles key challenges in automated bidding by combining expert guidance with bag reward mechanisms, providing a more robust solution for sequence decision-making in bidding environments with improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied in automated bidding.
Traditional approaches model bidding as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Recently, some studies have explored using generative reinforcement learning
methods to address long-term dependency issues in bidding environments.
Although effective, these methods typically rely on supervised learning
approaches, which are vulnerable to low data quality due to the amount of
sub-optimal bids and low probability rewards resulting from the low click and
conversion rates. Unfortunately, few studies have addressed these challenges.
  In this paper, we formalize the automated bidding as a sequence
decision-making problem and propose a novel Expert-guided Bag Reward
Transformer (EBaReT) to address concerns related to data quality and
uncertainty rewards. Specifically, to tackle data quality issues, we generate a
set of expert trajectories to serve as supplementary data in the training
process and employ a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning-based discriminator to
identify expert transitions. To ensure the decision also meets the expert
level, we further design a novel expert-guided inference strategy. Moreover, to
mitigate the uncertainty of rewards, we consider the transitions within a
certain period as a "bag" and carefully design a reward function that leads to
a smoother acquisition of rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art bidding
methods.

*Pengwei Jin,Di Huang,Chongxiao Li,Shuyao Cheng,Yang Zhao,Xinyao Zheng,Jiaguo Zhu,Shuyi Xing,Bohan Dou,Rui Zhang,Zidong Du,Qi Guo,Xing Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RealBench is the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on real-world IP-level Verilog generation tasks, featuring complex designs, multi-modal specifications, and rigorous verification. Even the best LLMs achieve only 13.3% success on module-level tasks and 0% on system-level tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in Verilog generation are inadequate because they use overly simple designs, provide insufficient design specifications, and lack rigorous verification environments, failing to replicate real-world hardware design workflows.

Method: The authors developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring: (1) complex, structured, real-world open-source IP designs, (2) multi-modal and formatted design specifications, (3) rigorous verification environments with 100% line coverage testbenches and formal checkers, and (4) support for both module-level and system-level tasks.

Result: Evaluation of various LLMs and agents on RealBench showed poor performance across the board. The best-performing LLM (o1-preview) achieved only 13.3% pass@1 on module-level tasks and 0% success rate on system-level tasks, demonstrating significant gaps in current LLM capabilities for real-world Verilog generation.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are inadequate for real-world IP-level Verilog generation tasks, as evidenced by their poor performance on RealBench. This highlights the urgent need for developing stronger and more capable Verilog generation models to meet the demands of practical hardware design automation.

Abstract: The automatic generation of Verilog code using Large Language Models (LLMs)
has garnered significant interest in hardware design automation. However,
existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in Verilog generation fall short in
replicating real-world design workflows due to their designs' simplicity,
inadequate design specifications, and less rigorous verification environments.
To address these limitations, we present RealBench, the first benchmark aiming
at real-world IP-level Verilog generation tasks. RealBench features complex,
structured, real-world open-source IP designs, multi-modal and formatted design
specifications, and rigorous verification environments, including 100% line
coverage testbenches and a formal checker. It supports both module-level and
system-level tasks, enabling comprehensive assessments of LLM capabilities.
Evaluations on various LLMs and agents reveal that even one of the
best-performing LLMs, o1-preview, achieves only a 13.3% pass@1 on module-level
tasks and 0% on system-level tasks, highlighting the need for stronger Verilog
generation models in the future. The benchmark is open-sourced at

*Xu Yang,Qi Zhang,Shuming Jiang,Yaowen Xu,Zhaofan Zou,Hao Sun,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: METER is a unified multi-modal benchmark for interpretable forgery detection across images, videos, audio, and audio-visual content that requires both classification and detailed explanations, paired with a three-stage Chain-of-Thought training strategy to advance generalizable and interpretable deepfake detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forgery detection methods focus only on binary classification without interpretable explanations, treat modalities separately without unified benchmarks, and lack applicability in safety-critical scenarios where detailed understanding of forgeries is crucial amid increasingly realistic synthetic content from generative AI.

Method: The authors introduce METER, a multi-modal benchmark with four tracks (images, videos, audio, audio-visual) requiring both real-vs-fake classification and evidence-chain-based explanations including spatio-temporal localization, textual rationales, and forgery type tracing. They propose a three-stage Chain-of-Thought training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a novel GRPO stage that integrates human-aligned evaluation with CoT reasoning.

Result: METER provides broader modality coverage and richer interpretability metrics compared to prior benchmarks, including spatial/temporal IoU, multi-class tracing, and evidence consistency measurements for comprehensive evaluation of forgery detection systems.

Conclusion: METER serves as a standardized foundation for advancing generalizable and interpretable forgery detection in the generative media era, addressing the critical need for explainable AI systems that can provide detailed understanding of synthetic content manipulation across multiple modalities.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative AI, synthetic content across images,
videos, and audio has become increasingly realistic, amplifying the risk of
misinformation. Existing detection approaches predominantly focus on binary
classification while lacking detailed and interpretable explanations of
forgeries, which limits their applicability in safety-critical scenarios.
Moreover, current methods often treat each modality separately, without a
unified benchmark for cross-modal forgery detection and interpretation. To
address these challenges, we introduce METER, a unified, multi-modal benchmark
for interpretable forgery detection spanning images, videos, audio, and
audio-visual content. Our dataset comprises four tracks, each requiring not
only real-vs-fake classification but also evidence-chain-based explanations,
including spatio-temporal localization, textual rationales, and forgery type
tracing. Compared to prior benchmarks, METER offers broader modality coverage
and richer interpretability metrics such as spatial/temporal IoU, multi-class
tracing, and evidence consistency. We further propose a human-aligned,
three-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training strategy combining SFT, DPO, and a
novel GRPO stage that integrates a human-aligned evaluator with CoT reasoning.
We hope METER will serve as a standardized foundation for advancing
generalizable and interpretable forgery detection in the era of generative
media.

*Alexander Mihalcea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AMPTCR, a novel molecular surface representation that combines quantum-derived scalar fields and topological descriptors in an aligned point cloud format to better predict molecular properties by capturing surface-local phenomena that traditional representations miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current molecular property prediction models rely on representations like SMILES strings and molecular graphs that overlook surface-local phenomena crucial for intermolecular behavior. 3D approaches either reduce surface detail or require computationally expensive SE(3)-equivariant architectures to handle spatial variance.

Method: AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and Topology Cloud Representation) creates molecular surface representations by combining local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors within an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes chemically meaningful scalars, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates transformed into a canonical reference frame, allowing efficient learning with conventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures.

Result: AMPTCR was evaluated using DGCNN on molecular weight prediction (validation RÂ² = 0.87) and bacterial growth inhibition tasks. For E. coli inhibition, it achieved ROC AUC of 0.912 for classification and RÂ² of 0.54 for regression using Dual Fukui functions as electronic descriptors and Morgan Fingerprints as auxiliary data.

Conclusion: AMPTCR provides a compact, expressive, and architecture-agnostic representation for modeling surface-mediated molecular properties, successfully encoding physically meaningful data while enabling efficient learning without requiring computationally expensive equivariant architectures.

Abstract: Machine learning models for molecular property prediction generally rely on
representations -- such as SMILES strings and molecular graphs -- that overlook
the surface-local phenomena driving intermolecular behavior. 3D-based
approaches often reduce surface detail or require computationally expensive
SE(3)-equivariant architectures to manage spatial variance. To overcome these
limitations, this work introduces AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and
Topology Cloud Representation), a molecular surface representation that
combines local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors
within an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes a chemically
meaningful scalar, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates
transformed into a canonical reference frame, enabling efficient learning with
conventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures. AMPTCR is evaluated using a DGCNN
framework on two tasks: molecular weight and bacterial growth inhibition. For
molecular weight, results confirm that AMPTCR encodes physically meaningful
data, with a validation R^2 of 0.87. In the bacterial inhibition task, AMPTCR
enables both classification and direct regression of E. coli inhibition values
using Dual Fukui functions as the electronic descriptor and Morgan Fingerprints
as auxiliary data, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.912 on the classification task,
and an R^2 of 0.54 on the regression task. These results help demonstrate that
AMPTCR offers a compact, expressive, and architecture-agnostic representation
for modeling surface-mediated molecular properties.

*Zixiao Huang,Junhao Hu,Hao Lin,Chunyang Zhu,Yueran Tang,Quanlu Zhang,Zhen Guo,Zhenhua Li,Shengen Yan,Zhenhua Zhu,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STWeaver is a GPU memory allocator that reduces memory fragmentation in deep learning training by combining offline planning with online allocation, achieving 79.2% average fragmentation reduction and up to 32.5% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face severe GPU memory pressure due to scaling, with training optimization techniques like virtual pipeline and recomputation causing memory fragmentation. Default allocators waste up to 43% of memory due to lack of tensor lifespan knowledge, leading to out-of-memory errors and ineffective optimization techniques.

Method: STWeaver combines offline planning with online allocation by exploiting spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors. The offline planning generates near-optimal allocation plans using spatio-temporal regularities, while online allocation handles dynamic models like Mixture-of-Experts. It's implemented as a pluggable PyTorch allocator.

Result: STWeaver reduces memory fragmentation ratio by 79.2% on average (up to 100%) across dense and sparse models with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient training configurations and improves performance by up to 32.5%.

Conclusion: STWeaver successfully addresses GPU memory fragmentation issues in deep learning training through its novel offline-online allocation paradigm, significantly improving memory efficiency and training performance while maintaining compatibility with existing frameworks.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased
GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization
techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor
lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory
allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online
strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of
memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques
ineffective or even unusable.
  To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep
learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and
temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads.
STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online
allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to
generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles
complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a
pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by
79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible
overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations
and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.

### [70] [Understanding Generalization, Robustness, and Interpretability in Low-Capacity Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16278)
*Yash Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between model capacity, sparsity, and robustness in low-capacity neural networks using binary classification tasks on MNIST with varying visual difficulty, finding that sparse subnetworks can maintain performance while over-parameterization improves corruption robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While modern deep learning focuses on massive over-parameterized models, understanding the fundamental relationships between capacity, sparsity, and robustness in simpler, low-capacity networks remains crucial for theoretical insights and practical applications where computational resources are limited.

Method: The authors created a controlled experimental framework using binary classification tasks from MNIST with increasing visual difficulty (e.g., distinguishing 0 vs 1, then 4 vs 9). They systematically varied model capacity and applied magnitude pruning up to 95% sparsity, then analyzed performance and robustness to input corruption. Interpretability was assessed using saliency maps to compare sparse and dense networks.

Result: Three key findings emerged: (1) minimum required model capacity scales directly with task complexity, (2) trained networks maintain performance even with extreme pruning up to 95% sparsity, indicating existence of high-performing sparse subnetworks, and (3) over-parameterization significantly improves robustness against input corruption. Saliency map analysis confirmed that sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning patterns of original dense models.

Conclusion: The study provides clear empirical evidence of fundamental trade-offs in simple neural networks, demonstrating that sparse subnetworks can maintain core functionality while over-parameterization offers robustness benefits. This contributes to theoretical understanding of capacity-sparsity-robustness relationships in neural networks.

Abstract: Although modern deep learning often relies on massive over-parameterized
models, the fundamental interplay between capacity, sparsity, and robustness in
low-capacity networks remains a vital area of study. We introduce a controlled
framework to investigate these properties by creating a suite of binary
classification tasks from the MNIST dataset with increasing visual difficulty
(e.g., 0 and 1 vs. 4 and 9). Our experiments reveal three core findings. First,
the minimum model capacity required for successful generalization scales
directly with task complexity. Second, these trained networks are robust to
extreme magnitude pruning (up to 95% sparsity), revealing the existence of
sparse, high-performing subnetworks. Third, we show that over-parameterization
provides a significant advantage in robustness against input corruption.
Interpretability analysis via saliency maps further confirms that these
identified sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning process of the
original dense models. This work provides a clear, empirical demonstration of
the foundational trade-offs governing simple neural networks.

*Boheng Li,Renjie Gu,Junjie Wang,Leyi Qi,Yiming Li,Run Wang,Zhan Qin,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework that makes text-to-image diffusion models more resilient to recovering harmful behaviors during downstream fine-tuning, using Moreau Envelope-based optimization and meta-learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic pretraining data, and existing safety unlearning methods become fragile when models undergo downstream fine-tuning, failing to retain their safety effectiveness even on benign datasets.

Method: ResAlign uses a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation to model downstream fine-tuning as an implicit optimization problem for efficient gradient estimation, combined with a meta-learning strategy that simulates diverse fine-tuning scenarios to improve generalization against harmful behavior recovery.

Result: Extensive experiments across various datasets, fine-tuning methods, and configurations show that ResAlign consistently outperforms prior unlearning approaches in maintaining safety after downstream fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capabilities.

Conclusion: ResAlign effectively addresses the fragility of safety unlearning methods to downstream fine-tuning, providing a robust framework that maintains model safety while preserving functionality across diverse fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image
generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized
applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic
pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven
unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity,
they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal
that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even
when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this
paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced
resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning
as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation,
ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of
harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to
simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve
generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets,
fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently
outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream
fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers developed Perovskite-R1, a specialized large language model trained on 1,232 scientific publications and 33,269 candidate materials to accelerate the discovery and design of perovskite solar cell precursor additives, demonstrating experimentally validated improvements in material stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perovskite solar cells show exceptional potential but face commercialization challenges including long-term stability, environmental sustainability, and scalable manufacturing. The explosive growth of scientific literature and complex material interactions make it difficult for researchers to efficiently access and utilize domain knowledge for precursor additive engineering solutions.

Method: The researchers systematically mined 1,232 high-quality scientific publications and integrated 33,269 candidate materials to construct a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset. They used automated question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning to fine-tune the QwQ-32B model, creating Perovskite-R1 with advanced reasoning capabilities for PSC precursor additive discovery and design.

Result: Perovskite-R1 can intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative solutions for defect passivation and precursor additive selection. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies confirmed their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance, demonstrating the practical value of the AI-driven approach.

Conclusion: The work successfully demonstrates that domain-adapted large language models can accelerate materials discovery in perovskite photovoltaics. The study provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent, data-driven advancements and shows the potential for AI to bridge the gap between vast scientific literature and practical material design solutions.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as a leading contender in
next-generation photovoltaic technologies, owing to their exceptional power
conversion efficiencies and advantageous material properties. Despite these
advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability,
and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization.
Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by
enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs. However, the explosive
growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials,
processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for
researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in
this rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a
specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities
tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By
systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications
and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we
constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated
question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the
QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can
intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and
practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor
additives. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies
confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance.
Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating
materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent,
data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research.

*Sara Ahmadian,Edith Cohen,Uri Stemmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a universal black-box adversarial attack against linear sketching methods for dimensionality reduction that can break any sketching matrix and estimator using O(kÂ²) queries, matching theoretical lower bounds and revealing fundamental vulnerabilities in compressed representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear sketching is widely used for dimensionality reduction but is known to be vulnerable to adversarial inputs. The authors aim to understand the fundamental limits of adversarial robustness in the black-box setting where attackers can only query the system without knowing the internal sketching matrix or estimation method.

Method: The authors develop a universal, non-adaptive black-box attack that works against any linear sketching matrix and any query responder (including randomized, adaptive, or tailored ones). The attack uses approximately O(kÂ²) queries to either cause failure in norm estimation or construct adversarial inputs that fool the optimal estimator for the query distribution.

Result: The attack achieves a tight match with known upper bounds of Î©(kÂ²) for specialized estimators like Johnson-Lindenstrauss transforms and AMS sketches. The attack is completely agnostic to the sketching matrix and estimator, demonstrating universal applicability across different linear sketching methods.

Conclusion: The work establishes fundamental limits on the adversarial robustness of linear sketching methods, showing that any such system can be attacked with O(kÂ²) queries regardless of its specific design. This reveals structural parallels to adversarial attacks in image classification and highlights inherent vulnerabilities in compressed representations that cannot be avoided through clever design choices.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction via linear sketching is a powerful and widely used
technique, but it is known to be vulnerable to adversarial inputs. We study the
black-box adversarial setting, where a fixed, hidden sketching matrix A in
$R^{k X n}$ maps high-dimensional vectors v $\in R^n$ to lower-dimensional
sketches A v in $R^k$, and an adversary can query the system to obtain
approximate ell2-norm estimates that are computed from the sketch.
  We present a universal, nonadaptive attack that, using tilde(O)($k^2$)
queries, either causes a failure in norm estimation or constructs an
adversarial input on which the optimal estimator for the query distribution
(used by the attack) fails. The attack is completely agnostic to the sketching
matrix and to the estimator: It applies to any linear sketch and any query
responder, including those that are randomized, adaptive, or tailored to the
query distribution.
  Our lower bound construction tightly matches the known upper bounds of
tilde(Omega)($k^2$), achieved by specialized estimators for Johnson
Lindenstrauss transforms and AMS sketches. Beyond sketching, our results
uncover structural parallels to adversarial attacks in image classification,
highlighting fundamental vulnerabilities of compressed representations.

*Yumeng Wang,Zengyi Wo,Wenjun Wang,Xingcheng Fu,Minglai Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HPGNN integrates Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks to better handle heterophilic graphs by capturing multi-scale node interactions, achieving superior performance on heterophilic datasets while maintaining competitiveness on homophilic ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs assume homophily (connected nodes share similar labels) which doesn't hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Current models for heterophilic graphs only consider pairwise relationships, missing multi-scale information from higher-order structures, leading to suboptimal performance especially under noise from conflicting class information.

Method: HPGNN proposes an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) integrated with Graph Neural Networks to capture long-range and multi-scale node interactions. The method embeds higher-order structural information into convolutional networks to model key interactions across diverse graph dimensions while reducing computational complexity.

Result: HPGNN outperforms 5 out of 7 state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining competitive performance on homophilic graphs. The model demonstrates effectiveness in balancing multi-scale information and shows robustness to noise.

Conclusion: HPGNN successfully addresses the limitations of existing GNNs in heterophilic settings by incorporating higher-order structural information through efficient PPR approximation. The model proves to be a versatile solution for real-world graph learning challenges, effectively handling both heterophilic and homophilic graphs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in node classification tasks but often
assume homophily, where connected nodes share similar labels. This assumption
does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for
heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking
multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal
performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across
nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating
Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces
an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture
long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces
computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By
embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks,
HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness.
The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art
methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining
competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance
multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution
for real-world graph learning challenges. Codes are available at

*Hailin Yue,Hulin Kuang,Jin Liu,Junjian Li,Lanlan Wang,Mengshen He,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CenSurv is a novel cancer survival prediction method that uses bipartite patient-modality graphs and event-conditional modeling of censoring to better handle multimodal data, missing modalities, and censored samples, achieving 3.1% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cancer survival prediction methods only focus on samples with known survival risks without fully utilizing censored samples, and suffer from performance degradation in modality-missing scenarios during inference.

Method: The method combines: (1) bipartite patient-modality graph structure to model multimodal data relationships, (2) complete-incomplete alignment strategy to handle missing modalities by exploring modality-agnostic features, and (3) event-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) module that uses dynamic momentum accumulation to select reliable censored data and assign accurate survival times.

Result: CenSurv outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.1% mean C-index on 5 cancer datasets, shows excellent robustness under various modality-missing scenarios, and the plug-and-play ECMC module improves 8 baseline methods by 1.3% mean C-index across datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CenSurv framework successfully addresses key limitations in cancer survival prediction by effectively utilizing censored data and handling missing modalities, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the survival of cancer patients is crucial for
personalized treatment. However, existing studies focus solely on the
relationships between samples with known survival risks, without fully
leveraging the value of censored samples. Furthermore, these studies may suffer
performance degradation in modality-missing scenarios and even struggle during
the inference process. In this study, we propose a bipartite patient-modality
graph learning with event-conditional modelling of censoring for cancer
survival prediction (CenSurv). Specifically, we first use graph structure to
model multimodal data and obtain representation. Then, to alleviate performance
degradation in modality-missing scenarios, we design a bipartite graph to
simulate the patient-modality relationship in various modality-missing
scenarios and leverage a complete-incomplete alignment strategy to explore
modality-agnostic features. Finally, we design a plug-and-play
event-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) that selects reliable censored
data using dynamic momentum accumulation confidences, assigns more accurate
survival times to these censored data, and incorporates them as uncensored data
into training. Comprehensive evaluations on 5 publicly cancer datasets showcase
the superiority of CenSurv over the best state-of-the-art by 3.1% in terms of
the mean C-index, while also exhibiting excellent robustness under various
modality-missing scenarios. In addition, using the plug-and-play ECMC module,
the mean C-index of 8 baselines increased by 1.3% across 5 datasets. Code of
CenSurv is available at https://github.com/yuehailin/CenSurv.

*Zhihan Zeng,Yiqi Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes SGD optimization for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in least-squares regression without requiring over-parameterization, showing that network width needs only depend on error tolerance rather than training sample size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous theoretical analysis of PINNs relied on over-parameterization regimes where network width must increase vastly with training samples, leading to prohibitive computational costs that are impractical for real experiments.

Method: The authors perform new optimization and generalization analysis for SGD in training two-layer PINNs by making specific assumptions about the target function to avoid the over-parameterization requirement.

Result: They prove that if network width exceeds a threshold depending only on error tolerance Îµ and the problem (not sample size), then both training loss and expected loss decrease below O(Îµ).

Conclusion: The work provides a more practical theoretical framework for PINNs that avoids over-parameterization constraints, showing convergence guarantees with network widths that scale with problem complexity rather than training data size.

Abstract: This work focuses on the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
solving least-squares regression with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).
Past work on this topic has been based on the over-parameterization regime,
whose convergence may require the network width to increase vastly with the
number of training samples. So, the theory derived from over-parameterization
may incur prohibitive computational costs and is far from practical
experiments. We perform new optimization and generalization analysis for SGD in
training two-layer PINNs, making certain assumptions about the target function
to avoid over-parameterization. Given $\epsilon>0$, we show that if the network
width exceeds a threshold that depends only on $\epsilon$ and the problem, then
the training loss and expected loss will decrease below $O(\epsilon)$.

### [77] [Improving Predictions on Highly Unbalanced Data Using Open Source Synthetic Data Upsampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16419)
*Ivona Krchova,Michael Platzer,Paul Tiwald*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks AI-generated synthetic data for addressing class imbalance in tabular datasets, showing that synthetic upsampling outperforms traditional methods like SMOTE-NC for minority class prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unbalanced tabular datasets pose significant challenges in real-world applications like fraud detection and medical diagnosis, where traditional ML algorithms favor majority classes and struggle with accurate minority class representation due to severe underrepresentation.

Method: The authors conduct a benchmark study using MOSTLY AI's Synthetic Data SDK to generate synthetic data for upsampling highly unbalanced tabular datasets, comparing predictive models trained on synthetically upsampled data against standard methods like naive oversampling and SMOTE-NC.

Result: Synthetic data upsampling consistently produces top-performing predictive models, particularly effective for mixed-type datasets with very few minority samples, by generating diverse data points that fill gaps in sparse feature space regions and improving predictive accuracy for minority groups.

Conclusion: AI-generated synthetic data provides an effective solution for addressing class imbalance in tabular datasets, offering superior performance compared to traditional upsampling methods and demonstrating particular strength in handling mixed-type data with severe minority class underrepresentation.

Abstract: Unbalanced tabular data sets present significant challenges for predictive
modeling and data analysis across a wide range of applications. In many
real-world scenarios, such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and rare
event prediction, minority classes are vastly underrepresented, making it
difficult for traditional machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy.
These algorithms tend to favor the majority class, leading to biased models
that struggle to accurately represent minority classes. Synthetic data holds
promise for addressing the under-representation of minority classes by
providing new, diverse, and highly realistic samples. This paper presents a
benchmark study on the use of AI-generated synthetic data for upsampling highly
unbalanced tabular data sets.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of an open-source solution, the Synthetic Data
SDK by MOSTLY AI, which provides a flexible and user-friendly approach to
synthetic upsampling for mixed-type data. We compare predictive models trained
on data sets upsampled with synthetic records to those using standard methods,
such as naive oversampling and SMOTE-NC. Our results demonstrate that synthetic
data can improve predictive accuracy for minority groups by generating diverse
data points that fill gaps in sparse regions of the feature space. We show that
upsampled synthetic training data consistently results in top-performing
predictive models, particularly for mixed-type data sets containing very few
minority samples.

### [78] [RIS-aided Latent Space Alignment for Semantic Channel Equalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16450)
*TomÃ¡s HÃ¼ttebrÃ¤ucker,Mario Edoardo Pandolfo,Simone Fiorellino,Emilio Calvanese Strinati,Paolo Di Lorenzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to address semantic mismatches in multi-user MIMO semantic communication systems, achieving better performance than conventional disjoint approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In semantic communication systems using DNNs, independently trained agents in multi-user settings develop divergent latent representations, causing semantic mismatches that impede mutual understanding even without traditional transmission errors. This problem needs to be addressed for effective AI-native device communication.

Method: The authors propose a joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework leveraging RIS in MIMO channels. The approach includes three transformation stages: pre-equalization at transmitter, RIS-aided channel propagation, and post-equalization at receiver. They formulate this as a constrained MMSE optimization problem and develop two solutions: linear semantic equalization chain and non-linear DNN-based semantic equalizer, both operating under semantic compression and power constraints.

Result: Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed joint equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional disjoint approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across various scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

Conclusion: The joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework with RIS successfully addresses semantic mismatches in multi-user MIMO semantic communication systems, providing superior performance compared to traditional separated equalization methods across diverse wireless environments.

Abstract: Semantic communication systems introduce a new paradigm in wireless
communications, focusing on transmitting the intended meaning rather than
ensuring strict bit-level accuracy. These systems often rely on Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more
efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting
agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint
optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead
to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of
traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical
and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is
implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at
the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a
post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a
constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two
solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear
DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under
semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power
constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint
equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint
approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range
of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

### [79] [Canonical Correlation Patterns for Validating Clustering of Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16497)
*Isabella Degen,Zahraa S Abdallah,Kate Robson Brown,Henry W J Reeve*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces canonical correlation patterns as validation targets for correlation-based clustering of multivariate time series, addressing the fundamental challenge of validating whether discovered clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering validity indices were designed for Euclidean data and their effectiveness for correlation patterns has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering with discrete geometric reference targets, correlations exist in continuous space without equivalent reference patterns, making validation challenging in high-stakes domains like health, finance, and industry.

Method: The authors introduce canonical correlation patterns as mathematically defined validation targets that discretize the infinite correlation space into finite, interpretable reference patterns. They use synthetic datasets with perfect ground truth across controlled conditions to evaluate different norms (L1 for mapping, L5 for silhouette width and Davies-Bouldin index) for validation performance.

Result: Canonical patterns provide reliable validation targets with L1 norm for mapping and L5 norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior performance. The methods demonstrate robustness to distribution shifts and appropriately detect correlation structure degradation.

Conclusion: This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains by providing practical implementation guidelines and demonstrating that canonical correlation patterns can effectively validate correlation-based clustering results.

Abstract: Clustering of multivariate time series using correlation-based methods
reveals regime changes in relationships between variables across health,
finance, and industrial applications. However, validating whether discovered
clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were
developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns
has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where
geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in
continuous space without equivalent reference patterns. We address this
validation gap by introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically
defined validation targets that discretise the infinite correlation space into
finite, interpretable reference patterns. Using synthetic datasets with perfect
ground truth across controlled conditions, we demonstrate that canonical
patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5
norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior
performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately
detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation
guidelines. This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous
correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains.

*David G. Nagy,Tingke Shen,Hanqi Zhou,Charley M. Wu,Peter Dayan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework where analogy enables flexible construction of internal models for novel situations by reusing structural components from past experiences through partial homomorphisms between Markov decision processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans need to construct internal models that are both faithful enough to enable effective planning and tractable to build. The challenge is balancing model accuracy with computational feasibility when navigating novel situations.

Method: The authors formalize analogies as partial homomorphisms between Markov decision processes and develop a framework using abstract modules derived from previous construals as composable building blocks for new model construction.

Result: The framework enables modular reuse of solution-relevant structure from past experiences, allowing flexible adaptation of policies and representations across domains that share structural essence while amortizing computational costs.

Conclusion: Analogy plays a central role in enabling agents to efficiently construct useful internal models by reusing structural components, making both model construction and planning more computationally tractable while maintaining effectiveness.

Abstract: Humans flexibly construct internal models to navigate novel situations. To be
useful, these internal models must be sufficiently faithful to the environment
that resource-limited planning leads to adequate outcomes; equally, they must
be tractable to construct in the first place. We argue that analogy plays a
central role in these processes, enabling agents to reuse solution-relevant
structure from past experiences and amortise the computational costs of both
model construction (construal) and planning. Formalising analogies as partial
homomorphisms between Markov decision processes, we sketch a framework in which
abstract modules, derived from previous construals, serve as composable
building blocks for new ones. This modular reuse allows for flexible adaptation
of policies and representations across domains with shared structural essence.

*Abhash Kumar Jha,Shakiba Moradian,Arjun Krishnakumar,Martin Rapp,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an extensible library for gradient-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) that addresses benchmark saturation and implementation fragmentation issues, revealing critical flaws in current evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of gradient-based one-shot NAS faces two major challenges: (1) overreliance on DARTS benchmark leading to saturation with improvements within noise margins, and (2) fragmented implementations across different repositories making fair comparisons difficult and hindering reproducible research.

Method: The authors develop Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an extensible library with a minimal API that enables easy integration of new search spaces and supports decomposition of NAS optimizers into core components. They create new DARTS-based benchmarks and combine them with a novel evaluation protocol.

Result: The framework successfully streamlines development and evaluation of gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. The new evaluation protocol reveals critical flaws in how current gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are assessed, providing insights into evaluation methodology issues.

Conclusion: Confopt addresses key issues in gradient-based NAS research by providing a unified framework for fair comparisons and revealing evaluation methodology problems. The library facilitates better development and assessment of NAS methods while exposing limitations in current evaluation practices.

Abstract: Gradient-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) has significantly
reduced the cost of exploring architectural spaces with discrete design
choices, such as selecting operations within a model. However, the field faces
two major challenges. First, evaluations of gradient-based NAS methods heavily
rely on the DARTS benchmark, despite the existence of other available
benchmarks. This overreliance has led to saturation, with reported improvements
often falling within the margin of noise. Second, implementations of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are fragmented across disparate
repositories, complicating fair and reproducible comparisons and further
development. In this paper, we introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an
extensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. Confopt provides a minimal API that makes
it easy for users to integrate new search spaces, while also supporting the
decomposition of NAS optimizers into their core components. We use this
framework to create a suite of new DARTS-based benchmarks, and combine them
with a novel evaluation protocol to reveal a critical flaw in how
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are currently assessed. The code can be

*Christian D. Blakely*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A symbolic framework for graph classification using sparse binary hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines that encodes graphs through structured message passing while maintaining interpretability and achieving competitive performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks lack interpretability and transparency in their decision-making process. There is a need for graph classification methods that can provide symbolic transparency while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling users to understand how classifications are made.

Method: A multilayered symbolic framework that uses sparse binary hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines. Graphs are encoded through structured message passing where node, edge, and attribute information are bound and bundled into symbolic hypervectors. The method preserves hierarchical semantics through layered binding from node attributes to edge relations to structural roles, creating compact discrete representations with a local interpretability framework.

Result: The method demonstrates competitive accuracy on TUDataset benchmarks while providing strong symbolic transparency compared to neural graph models. The approach successfully maintains performance while offering interpretable results through the local interpretability framework.

Conclusion: The proposed symbolic framework successfully combines competitive graph classification performance with interpretability. By using hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines with structured message passing, the method achieves the dual goals of accuracy and transparency, making it a viable alternative to black-box neural graph models for applications requiring interpretable decisions.

Abstract: We propose a multilayered symbolic framework for general graph classification
that leverages sparse binary hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines. Each graph is
encoded through structured message passing, where node, edge, and attribute
information are bound and bundled into a symbolic hypervector. This process
preserves the hierarchical semantics of the graph through layered binding from
node attributes to edge relations to structural roles resulting in a compact,
discrete representation. We also formulate a local interpretability framework
which lends itself to a key advantage of our approach being locally
interpretable. We validate our method on TUDataset benchmarks, demonstrating
competitive accuracy with strong symbolic transparency compared to neural graph
models.

*Zhengyu Wu,Xunkai Li,Yinlin Zhu,Zekai Chen,Guochen Yan,Yanyu Yan,Hao Zhang,Yuming Ai,Xinmo Jin,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This survey proposes a novel data-centric taxonomy for Federated Graph Learning (FGL) that categorizes research based on data characteristics and utilization, moving beyond existing methodology-focused approaches to better understand how FGL handles data-centric challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGL surveys focus primarily on integrating Federated Learning and Graph Machine Learning with emphasis on methodology and simulated scenarios, but lack a systematic data-centric perspective that examines how FGL methods handle data properties and usage to enhance model performance in real-world big data applications.

Method: The paper introduces a two-level data-centric taxonomy: (1) Data Characteristics - categorizing studies based on structural and distributional properties of datasets used in FGL, and (2) Data Utilization - analyzing training procedures and techniques to overcome data-centric challenges. Each taxonomy level uses three orthogonal criteria representing distinct data-centric configurations.

Result: The survey successfully reorganizes FGL research through the proposed data-centric lens, examines FGL integration with Pretrained Large Models, showcases realistic applications, and provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how different FGL approaches handle various data-centric constraints and configurations.

Conclusion: The data-centric taxonomy provides a more systematic and practical framework for understanding FGL research compared to existing methodology-focused surveys, offering better insights into how FGL methods tackle real-world data challenges while highlighting future directions aligned with emerging trends in Graph Machine Learning.

Abstract: In the era of big data applications, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has
emerged as a prominent solution that reconcile the tradeoff between optimizing
the collective intelligence between decentralized datasets holders and
preserving sensitive information to maximum. Existing FGL surveys have
contributed meaningfully but largely focus on integrating Federated Learning
(FL) and Graph Machine Learning (GML), resulting in early stage taxonomies that
emphasis on methodology and simulated scenarios. Notably, a data centric
perspective, which systematically examines FGL methods through the lens of data
properties and usage, remains unadapted to reorganize FGL research, yet it is
critical to assess how FGL studies manage to tackle data centric constraints to
enhance model performances. This survey propose a two-level data centric
taxonomy: Data Characteristics, which categorizes studies based on the
structural and distributional properties of datasets used in FGL, and Data
Utilization, which analyzes the training procedures and techniques employed to
overcome key data centric challenges. Each taxonomy level is defined by three
orthogonal criteria, each representing a distinct data centric configuration.
Beyond taxonomy, this survey examines FGL integration with Pretrained Large
Models, showcases realistic applications, and highlights future direction
aligned with emerging trends in GML.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops new machine learning methods for CW complexes by deriving Wasserstein distance expressions using Hodge-Laplacian matrices and introducing novel kernels based on optimal transport theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell complexes are considered ideal learning representations, but there is a lack of suitable machine learning methods for learning on CW complexes, creating a gap between theoretical potential and practical applications.

Method: The authors derive an explicit expression for Wasserstein distance between cell complex signal distributions using Hodge-Laplacian matrices, extend the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to CW complexes, and introduce novel kernels over probability measures on CW complexes based on dual formulation of optimal transport.

Result: The paper provides a structurally meaningful measure to compare CW complexes, defines optimal transportation maps, and creates methods that simultaneously incorporate both feature and structure information through the extended Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges the gap between cell complex theory and practical machine learning by providing concrete mathematical tools (Wasserstein distances and kernels) that enable learning on CW complexes while preserving both structural and feature information.

Abstract: Recent advances have discussed cell complexes as ideal learning
representations. However, there is a lack of available machine learning methods
suitable for learning on CW complexes. In this paper, we derive an explicit
expression for the Wasserstein distance between cell complex signal
distributions in terms of a Hodge-Laplacian matrix. This leads to a
structurally meaningful measure to compare CW complexes and define the optimal
transportation map. In order to simultaneously include both feature and
structure information, we extend the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to CW
complexes. Finally, we introduce novel kernels over the space of probability
measures on CW complexes based on the dual formulation of optimal transport.

*Yuqi Pan,Yongqi An,Zheng Li,Yuhong Chou,Ruijie Zhu,Xiaohui Wang,Mingxuan Wang,Jinqiao Wang,Guoqi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Sparse State Expansion (SSE), a novel linear attention mechanism that addresses Transformer's quadratic complexity in long-context scenarios through row-sparse updates and state partitioning, achieving strong performance in retrieval and mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Transformers suffer from quadratic computation and linear memory growth in long-context scenarios. Existing linear attention variants that compress context into fixed-size states often degrade performance in tasks requiring in-context retrieval and reasoning, necessitating more effective context compression methods.

Method: The paper introduces two key innovations: (1) A row-sparse update formulation for linear attention that conceptualizes state updating as information classification, enabling sparse updates via softmax-based top-k hard classification; (2) Sparse State Expansion (SSE) that expands contextual state into multiple partitions, decoupling parameter size from state capacity while maintaining sparse classification.

Result: SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and favorable scaling with state size. The 2B SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among small models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25, significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers across language modeling, retrieval, and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSE represents a promising and efficient architecture for long-context modeling that successfully addresses the efficiency-performance trade-off in linear attention mechanisms, providing an effective solution for extending receptive fields while maintaining discriminative state representations.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, despite its widespread success, struggles with
long-context scenarios due to quadratic computation and linear memory growth.
While various linear attention variants mitigate these efficiency constraints
by compressing context into fixed-size states, they often degrade performance
in tasks such as in-context retrieval and reasoning. To address this limitation
and achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations.
First, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by
conceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables
sparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby
extending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we
present Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands
the contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter
size from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm.
Our design, supported by efficient parallelized implementations, yields
effective classification and discriminative state representations. We
extensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures
across language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably
with state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B
SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among
small reasoning models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25,
significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers. These
results highlight SSE as a promising and efficient architecture for
long-context modeling.

*Yushang Zhao,Huijie Shen,Dannier Li,Lu Chang,Chengrui Zhou,Yinuo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning framework using prompt-tuning to personalize LLM-based recommender systems for cold-start users, achieving real-time performance under 300ms with applications in both recommendation and financial risk profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based recommender systems struggle with cold-start users who have little to no interaction history, and existing solutions like supervised fine-tuning and collaborative filtering are expensive to maintain and update for dense user-item scenarios.

Method: A meta-learning framework that performs parameter-efficient prompt-tuning using soft prompt embeddings optimized with first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization, treating each user as a separate task. The method uses episodic sampling, inner-loop adaptation, and outer-loop generalization to meta-optimize learnable prompt vectors that serve as differentiable control variables representing user behavioral priors.

Result: The model outperforms strong baselines on MovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole datasets in NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR metrics, runs in real-time (below 300ms) on consumer GPUs, supports zero-history personalization, and achieves 275ms adaptation rate enabling real-time financial risk profiling applications.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses cold-start personalization in LLM-based recommender systems with fast adaptation capabilities, demonstrating potential for both recommendation tasks and critical applications like real-time financial risk profiling that can strengthen payment network stability and national financial infrastructure resilience.

Abstract: Generative, explainable, and flexible recommender systems, derived using
Large Language Models (LLM) are promising and poorly adapted to the cold-start
user situation, where there is little to no history of interaction. The current
solutions i.e. supervised fine-tuning and collaborative filtering are
dense-user-item focused and would be expensive to maintain and update. This
paper introduces a meta-learning framework, that can be used to perform
parameter-efficient prompt-tuning, to effectively personalize LLM-based
recommender systems quickly at cold-start. The model learns soft prompt
embeddings with first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization by
treating each of the users as the tasks. As augmentations to the input tokens,
these learnable vectors are the differentiable control variables that represent
user behavioral priors. The prompts are meta-optimized through episodic
sampling, inner-loop adaptation, and outer-loop generalization. On
MovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole, we can see that our adaptive model
outperforms strong baselines in NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR, and it runs in
real-time (i.e., below 300 ms) on consumer GPUs. Zero-history personalization
is also supported by this scalable solution, and its 275 ms rate of adaptation
allows successful real-time risk profiling of financial systems by shortening
detection latency and improving payment network stability. Crucially, the 275
ms adaptation capability can enable real-time risk profiling for financial
institutions, reducing systemic vulnerability detection latency significantly
versus traditional compliance checks. By preventing contagion in payment
networks (e.g., Fedwire), the framework strengthens national financial
infrastructure resilience.

*Andrea Alamiaa,Sabine Muzellec,Thomas Serre,Rufin VanRullen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a brain-inspired neural network architecture that combines Transformer attention mechanisms with binding by synchrony theory, using angular phases and Kuramoto dynamics to improve feature binding and achieve better performance on multi-object classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous brain-inspired routing by agreement mechanisms showed improved noise robustness but were insufficient for multi-classification tasks. The authors aimed to address the visual binding problem in neural networks by drawing inspiration from neuroscience theory of binding by synchrony, which proposes that the brain binds features by synchronizing temporal activity of neurons encoding those features.

Method: The authors incorporated angular phases into all layers of a convolutional network and used Kuramoto dynamics to achieve phase alignment. This approach enhances operations between neurons with similar phases while suppressing those with opposite phases, combining Transformer attentional operations with binding by synchrony theory to create a global attentional system.

Result: The proposed mechanism achieved better accuracy than CNN networks on two datasets: pairs of digits and MNIST items superimposed on CIFAR-10 images. The method demonstrated improved noise robustness and better generalization abilities compared to baseline networks.

Conclusion: The paper successfully proposes a novel mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by leveraging synergy between neuroscience and machine learning, demonstrating that brain-inspired architectures combining attention mechanisms with synchrony-based binding can improve performance on multi-object classification tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer architectures have revolutionized most fields of
artificial intelligence, relying on an attentional mechanism based on the
agreement between keys and queries to select and route information in the
network. In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture
that leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by
agreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by
matching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire
network. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise
robustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification
tasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that
combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling
neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that
the brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of
neurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the
same object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We
drew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all
layers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto
dynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with
similar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits
of this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one
composed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image.
Our results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to
noise and with better generalization abilities. Overall, we propose a novel
mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by
leveraging the synergy between neuroscience and machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flash-ABFT is a novel error detection method for attention mechanism accelerators that computes a single online checksum across the entire three-matrix product (query, key, value) including softmax operation, achieving high fault detection with only 5.3% area and 1.9% energy overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques can only verify individual matrix multiplications but cannot handle the complete attention mechanism, especially due to intermediate softmax normalization. There is a need for efficient error detection in specialized hardware accelerators for Transformers and LLMs that can cover the entire attention computation.

Method: Flash-ABFT computes an online checksum across the entire three-matrix product of query, key, and value matrices in an attention layer, including the softmax operation, using a single comprehensive check instead of multiple individual matrix multiplication verifications.

Result: Flash-ABFT achieves high fault-detection accuracy while incurring only 5.3% hardware area overhead and less than 1.9% energy overhead. The method significantly reduces computational overhead by eliminating redundant checks compared to traditional ABFT approaches.

Conclusion: Flash-ABFT provides a cost-effective and robust solution for error detection in attention accelerators by offering comprehensive fault detection across the entire attention mechanism with minimal hardware and energy overhead, making it practical for deployment in specialized AI hardware.

Abstract: Transformers and large language models (LLMs), powered by the attention
mechanism, have transformed numerous AI applications, driving the need for
specialized hardware accelerators. A major challenge in these accelerators is
efficiently detecting errors caused by random hardware faults. Traditional
algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques verify individual matrix
multiplications but fall short in handling the full attention mechanism,
particularly due to intermediate softmax normalization. This work proposes
Flash-ABFT, a novel method that computes an online checksum across the entire
three-matrix product of query, key and value matrices, of an attention layer,
including the softmax operation, with a single check. This approach
significantly reduces overhead by eliminating redundant checks while
maintaining high fault-detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate
that Flash-ABFT incurs only 5.3% hardware area overhead and less than 1.9%
energy overhead, making it a cost-effective and robust solution for error
detection in attention accelerators.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a MIMO-based approach to solve semantic misalignment problems in communications by jointly learning precoder/decoder pairs that perform latent space compression and semantic channel equalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic communications can suffer from mismatches when devices use different languages, logic, or internal representations, which hinders mutual understanding and successful task completion in information exchange.

Method: The paper develops two solutions: (1) a linear model optimized using biconvex optimization solved via ADMM, and (2) a neural network-based model that learns semantic MIMO precoder/decoder pairs under power budget and complexity constraints. Both methods jointly perform latent space compression and semantic channel equalization.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MIMO-based approach in goal-oriented semantic communication scenarios, showing clear trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and solution complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed MIMO precoder/decoder approach successfully addresses latent space misalignment in semantic communications by simultaneously handling semantic mismatches and physical channel impairments, providing flexible solutions with different complexity-performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Semantic communications focus on prioritizing the understanding of the
meaning behind transmitted data and ensuring the successful completion of tasks
that motivate the exchange of information. However, when devices rely on
different languages, logic, or internal representations, semantic mismatches
may occur, potentially hindering mutual understanding. This paper introduces a
novel approach to addressing latent space misalignment in semantic
communications, exploiting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
communications. Specifically, our method learns a MIMO precoder/decoder pair
that jointly performs latent space compression and semantic channel
equalization, mitigating both semantic mismatches and physical channel
impairments. We explore two solutions: (i) a linear model, optimized by solving
a biconvex optimization problem via the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM); (ii) a neural network-based model, which learns semantic
MIMO precoder/decoder under transmission power budget and complexity
constraints. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in a goal-oriented semantic communication scenario, illustrating the
main trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and complexity of the
solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FISHER is a foundation model that unifies multi-modal industrial signal analysis (M5 problem) using STFT sub-bands and teacher-student SSL framework, achieving 5.03% performance gain over existing SSL models on the RMIS benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial SCADA systems generate heterogeneous signals (M5 problem) that previous works handle with specialized models for sub-problems, failing to leverage synergies between modalities and scaling laws. The authors argue these diverse signals share intrinsic similarities that enable unified modeling.

Method: FISHER uses STFT sub-bands as modeling units to handle arbitrary sampling rates by treating rate increments as sub-band concatenation. The model employs a teacher-student self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for pre-training on multi-modal industrial signals.

Result: FISHER demonstrates versatile capabilities with up to 5.03% general performance improvement over top SSL models on the RMIS benchmark. The model shows more efficient scaling curves and the authors investigate scaling laws for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: FISHER successfully addresses the M5 problem by providing a unified foundation model for multi-modal industrial signal analysis, outperforming specialized approaches while offering better scalability and efficiency. The model and RMIS benchmark are open-sourced for future research.

Abstract: With the rapid deployment of SCADA systems, how to effectively analyze
industrial signals and detect abnormal states is an urgent need for the
industry. Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we
summarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems
and employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between
modalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals
can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a
result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal
compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER
considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band
information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit
and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop
the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial
signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models,
FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general
performance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We
also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential
avenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on

### [91] [Screen2AX: Vision-Based Approach for Automatic macOS Accessibility Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16704)
*Viktor Muryn,Marta Sumyk,Mariya Hirna,Sofiya Garkot,Maksym Shamrai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Screen2AX is a framework that automatically generates accessibility metadata from screenshots to help AI agents and assistive technologies interpret desktop interfaces, achieving 77% F1 score in accessibility tree reconstruction and 2.2x performance improvement over native systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many desktop applications lack proper accessibility metadata (only 33% of macOS apps offer full support), making them inaccessible to users with disabilities and difficult for AI agents to interpret. Existing solutions only address specific challenges rather than capturing the full hierarchical complexity of desktop interfaces.

Method: The framework uses vision-language and object detection models to detect, describe, and hierarchically organize UI elements from a single screenshot, mirroring macOS's system-level accessibility structure. The authors compiled three datasets with 112 macOS applications annotated for UI element detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata.

Result: Screen2AX achieves 77% F1 score in reconstructing complete accessibility trees and demonstrates 2.2x performance improvement over native accessibility representations. It outperforms the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2 system on the ScreenSpot benchmark when evaluated using the newly introduced Screen2AX-Task benchmark.

Conclusion: Screen2AX successfully bridges the gap in desktop accessibility by automatically generating real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from screenshots, significantly improving both accessibility for users with disabilities and autonomous agent performance in desktop environments.

Abstract: Desktop accessibility metadata enables AI agents to interpret screens and
supports users who depend on tools like screen readers. Yet, many applications
remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by
developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS
offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen
representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element
detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of
desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically
create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single
screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to
detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's
system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of
data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three
datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element
detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside
corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees,
achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree.
Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to
interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce
Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous
agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we
demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native
accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2
system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.

*Morad Tukan,Loay Mualem,Eitan Netzer,Liran Sigalat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for tuning coreset generation to improve classification performance by introducing new parameters beyond traditional sensitivity scores, demonstrating superior results compared to vanilla coresets and full dataset training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional sensitivity-based coreset construction focuses on loss approximation rather than optimizing for classification performance metrics like F1 score, which limits their effectiveness for classification tasks in data-centric AI applications.

Method: The authors develop a systematic framework that introduces tunable parameters including deterministic sampling, class-wise allocation, and refinement via active sampling, going beyond traditional sensitivity scores to optimize coreset generation for classification quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and classifiers show that tuned coresets significantly outperform both vanilla coresets and full dataset training on key classification metrics, providing more efficient model training.

Conclusion: The proposed tuning framework for coreset generation offers an effective path towards better and more efficient model training by optimizing for classification performance rather than just loss approximation, demonstrating the importance of task-specific data curation in data-centric AI.

Abstract: In the era of data-centric AI, the ability to curate high-quality training
data is as crucial as model design. Coresets offer a principled approach to
data reduction, enabling efficient learning on large datasets through
importance sampling. However, conventional sensitivity-based coreset
construction often falls short in optimizing for classification performance
metrics, e.g., $F1$ score, focusing instead on loss approximation. In this
work, we present a systematic framework for tuning the coreset generation
process to enhance downstream classification quality. Our method introduces new
tunable parameters--including deterministic sampling, class-wise allocation,
and refinement via active sampling, beyond traditional sensitivity scores.
Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and classifiers, we
demonstrate that tuned coresets can significantly outperform both vanilla
coresets and full dataset training on key classification metrics, offering an
effective path towards better and more efficient model training.

### [93] [A Partitioned Sparse Variational Gaussian Process for Fast, Distributed Spatial Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16771)
*Michael Grosskopf,Kellin Rumsey,Ayan Biswas,Earl Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP), a scalable machine learning approach for exascale supercomputers that enables in-situ training on spatially distributed data by allowing limited communication between neighboring spatial partitions to create smoother, more continuous response surfaces compared to independent SVGP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-generation exascale supercomputers will generate far more computational data than can be stored to disk, making post-hoc statistical analysis impossible. This creates an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning algorithms that can perform in-situ training on spatially distributed data across nodes while being highly scalable and memory efficient.

Method: The authors extend the independent sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) approach by introducing limited communication between neighboring spatial partitions. This Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) method uses a decentralized communication scheme that encourages better alignment between local models at shared boundaries while maintaining scalability and adding minimal computational overhead.

Result: The PSVGP approach produces smoother spatial predictions and better overall fit compared to independent SVGP models by reducing discontinuities at partition boundaries. The method maintains high scalability with very little additional computational overhead and no additional memory requirements. Demonstration on the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) shows improved performance over the independent SVGP case.

Conclusion: The proposed PSVGP method successfully addresses the discontinuity problem of independent SVGP models while preserving their scalability and efficiency advantages. The approach is well-suited for exascale computing environments where in-situ machine learning is essential, providing a practical solution for statistical analysis when data cannot be stored for post-processing.

Abstract: The next generation of Department of Energy supercomputers will be capable of
exascale computation. For these machines, far more computation will be possible
than that which can be saved to disk. As a result, users will be unable to rely
on post-hoc access to data for uncertainty quantification and other statistical
analyses and there will be an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning
algorithms which can be trained in situ. Algorithms deployed in this setting
must be highly scalable, memory efficient and capable of handling data which is
distributed across nodes as spatially contiguous partitions. One suitable
approach involves fitting a sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model
independently and in parallel to each spatial partition. The resulting model is
scalable, efficient and generally accurate, but produces the undesirable effect
of constructing discontinuous response surfaces due to the disagreement between
neighboring models at their shared boundary. In this paper, we extend this idea
by allowing for a small amount of communication between neighboring spatial
partitions which encourages better alignment of the local models, leading to
smoother spatial predictions and a better fit in general. Due to our
decentralized communication scheme, the proposed extension remains highly
scalable and adds very little overhead in terms of computation (and none, in
terms of memory). We demonstrate this Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) approach for the
Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and compare the results to the
independent SVGP case.

*Helena Casademunt,Caden Juang,Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAFT is a new technique that uses interpretability tools to control how large language models generalize during fine-tuning by ablating undesired concepts in the model's latent space, without requiring changes to training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard approaches to prevent unintended out-of-distribution generalization in LLMs require modifying training data, which is not always practical. There's a need for methods that can control LLM generalization without changing the training data or using target distribution data.

Method: Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT) identifies directions in an LLM's latent space that correspond to undesired concepts, then uses linear projections to ablate these concepts during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended generalizations.

Result: CAFT was successfully applied to three fine-tuning tasks, including emergent misalignment. It reduced misaligned responses by 10x while maintaining performance on the training distribution, all without modifying the fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization that doesn't require modifying training data, offering a practical solution to control unintended out-of-distribution generalization in fine-tuned language models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can lead to unintended
out-of-distribution generalization. Standard approaches to this problem rely on
modifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the
intended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce
Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages
interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without
needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target
distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding
to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear
projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended
generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks,
including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow
task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions.
Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses
by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall,
CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without
modifying training data.

### [95] [Beyond Binary Rewards: Training LMs to Reason About Their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16806)
*Mehul Damani,Isha Puri,Stewart Slocum,Idan Shenfeld,Leshem Choshen,Yoon Kim,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), a method that trains language models to generate both accurate predictions and well-calibrated confidence estimates by augmenting binary correctness rewards with Brier scores, resulting in improved calibration without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL training for reasoning models uses binary rewards that only evaluate correctness, leading to degraded calibration and increased hallucination rates. Models trained this way often generate overconfident incorrect responses, making them unreliable for practical applications where confidence estimation is crucial.

Method: RLCR modifies the reward function by combining binary correctness scores with Brier scores (a proper scoring rule for confidence estimates). During training, language models generate both predictions and numerical confidence estimates, then optimize this augmented reward function that incentivizes both accuracy and calibrated confidence prediction.

Result: RLCR substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy across diverse datasets, both in-domain and out-of-domain. It outperforms ordinary RL training and post-hoc confidence classifiers. The method also enables confidence-weighted scaling at test time to further improve accuracy and calibration.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing for calibration during RL training produces more generally reliable reasoning models. The theoretical proof shows that reward functions using bounded, proper scoring rules yield well-calibrated predictions, and empirical results demonstrate that RLCR successfully addresses the calibration problems inherent in traditional RL approaches.

Abstract: When language models (LMs) are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate natural language "reasoning chains", their performance improves on a
variety of difficult question answering tasks. Today, almost all successful
applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the
correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize
guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect
of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate
incorrect responses (or "hallucinate") in other problem domains. This paper
describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach
to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated
confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical
confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward
function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a
scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.
We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that
uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both
accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR
substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain
and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and
classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL
hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized
confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration
via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly
optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning
models.

### [96] [Semi-off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Slow-thinking Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16814)
*Junhao Shen,Haiteng Zhao,Yuzhe Gu,Songyang Gao,Kuikun Liu,Haian Huang,Jianfei Gao,Dahua Lin,Wenwei Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOPHIA is a semi-off-policy reinforcement learning method that enhances large vision-language models with slow-thinking reasoning by combining on-policy visual understanding with off-policy reasoning from language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multimodal reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models struggle with complex multimodal reasoning tasks because they are primarily trained for vision-language alignment. On-policy RL is limited by the model's initial abilities, while off-policy RL can cause visual hallucinations when distilling trajectories from external models with mismatched visual perception abilities.

Method: SOPHIA creates a semi-off-policy behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model. It assigns outcome-based rewards to reasoning, propagates visual rewards backward, and uses off-policy RL algorithms to train the LVLM on reasoning trajectories with propagated rewards.

Result: SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% on average, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. It outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4.1 on MathVision (49.08% pass@1) and OlympiadBench (49.95% pass@1), and surpasses supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy RL methods.

Conclusion: SOPHIA effectively enhances vision-language models with slow-thinking reasoning capabilities through semi-off-policy RL, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and providing better policy initialization for further on-policy training. The approach successfully addresses the limitations of both on-policy and off-policy RL in multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) with visual slow-thinking
reasoning is crucial for solving complex multimodal tasks. However, since LVLMs
are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability
because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL
offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling
trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to
mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues,
this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for
vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy
behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable
LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns
outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward.
Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning
trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive
experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the
effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in
average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on
multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some
closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and
OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively.
Analysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy
RL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy
training.

*Xingjian Zhang,Yizhuo Wang,Guillaume Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: COMPASS is a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that enables decentralized agents to efficiently monitor multiple moving targets using graph-based spatial reasoning, spatio-temporal attention networks, and Gaussian Process-based target modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like disaster response, environmental sensing, and wildlife conservation require persistent monitoring of dynamic targets by mobile agents under uncertainty, necessitating efficient coordination and information gathering strategies.

Method: The framework models the environment as a graph with spatial nodes and topological edges, uses a shared spatio-temporal attention network for action selection, employs Gaussian Processes for target dynamics modeling with uncertainty-aware planning, and trains using centralized value estimation with decentralized policy execution under adaptive rewards.

Result: COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines across dynamic multi-target scenarios in three key metrics: uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed COMPASS framework successfully addresses the persistent monitoring challenge by combining graph-based spatial reasoning, attention mechanisms, and principled uncertainty modeling to achieve superior performance in multi-agent target tracking scenarios.

Abstract: Persistent monitoring of dynamic targets is essential in real-world
applications such as disaster response, environmental sensing, and wildlife
conservation, where mobile agents must continuously gather information under
uncertainty. We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple
moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes
represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing
agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as
needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared
spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical
observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian
Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable
uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation
and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong
baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination
efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.

### [98] [Smooth Games of Configuration in the Linear-Quadratic Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16611)
*Jesse Milzman,Jeffrey Mao,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces "games of configuration" - a two-stage framework where agents first strategically choose configuration parameters that affect their dynamics and costs in a subsequent differential game, providing methods to compute equilibrium solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic game theory literature focuses on solving games with fixed parameters, but lacks strategic perspective on how agents should choose these configuration parameters when their choices influence each other's decisions and outcomes.

Method: The authors define a two-stage game framework within finite-horizon affine-quadratic differential games: (1) first stage - players choose configuration parameters, (2) second stage - players play the resulting differential game. They develop subgame perfect solution concepts, cost gradient computation methods, and gradient-based algorithms for finding local equilibrium configurations.

Result: The paper provides a complete mathematical framework including necessary conditions for equilibrium configurations, gradient-based solution methods, and demonstrates effectiveness through examples in both zero-sum and general-sum affine-quadratic systems.

Conclusion: The game of configuration framework successfully addresses the gap in strategic parameter selection for dynamic games, offering both theoretical foundations and practical computational methods for finding equilibrium configurations in multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Dynamic game theory offers a toolbox for formalizing and solving for both
cooperative and non-cooperative strategies in multi-agent scenarios. However,
the optimal configuration of such games remains largely unexplored. While there
is existing literature on the parametrization of dynamic games, little research
examines this parametrization from a strategic perspective where each agent's
configuration choice is influenced by the decisions of others. In this work, we
introduce the concept of a game of configuration, providing a framework for the
strategic fine-tuning of differential games. We define a game of configuration
as a two-stage game within the setting of finite-horizon, affine-quadratic, AQ,
differential games. In the first stage, each player chooses their corresponding
configuration parameter, which will impact their dynamics and costs in the
second stage. We provide the subgame perfect solution concept and a method for
computing first stage cost gradients over the configuration space. This then
allows us to formulate a gradient-based method for searching for local
solutions to the configuration game, as well as provide necessary conditions
for equilibrium configurations over their downstream (second stage)
trajectories. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in
example AQ systems, both zero-sum and general-sum.
