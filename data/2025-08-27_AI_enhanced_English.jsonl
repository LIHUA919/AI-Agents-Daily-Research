Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a\nmodular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn\nbiologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and\nmetabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four\ncancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response\n(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance\nmechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal\nsignaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous\nbiological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations\nof tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes\nand known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate\ninterpretable, clinically relevant insights.
