*Chenglin Yu,Yuchen Wang,Songmiao Wang,Hongxia Yang,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfiAgent: Framework using file-centric state abstraction to bound agent context for stable long-horizon reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with long-horizon tasks due to unbounded context growth and accumulated errors. Existing solutions like context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting create trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability.

Method: InfiAgent framework with file-centric state abstraction: externalizes persistent state into files, reconstructs context at each step from workspace state snapshot plus fixed window of recent actions.

Result: On DeepResearch and 80-paper literature review tasks, InfiAgent with 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines, without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Explicit state externalization represents a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents, as demonstrated by InfiAgent's competitive performance.

Abstract: LLM agents can reason and use tools, but they often break down on long-horizon tasks due to unbounded context growth and accumulated errors. Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents. Github Repo:https://github.com/ChenglinPoly/infiAgent

### [2] [Textual Explanations and Their Evaluations for Reinforcement Learning Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02514)
*Ahmad Terra,Mohit Ahmed,Rafia Inam,Elena Fersman,Martin Törngren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: New XRL framework uses LLMs and clustering to generate textual explanations, refines them into transparent rules, and enables systematic evaluation, improving over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring correctness in textual explanations for RL policies, and provide systematic, quantitative evaluation lacking in state-of-the-art XRL methods.

Method: Uses an LLM and clustering to generate textual explanations, converts them to transparent rules, and applies two refinement techniques to improve quality. Incorporates expert knowledge and automatic predicate generation.

Result: The framework outperforms existing Autonomous Policy Explanation method, reduces conflicting information, and generates transparent rules achieving satisfactory performance on certain tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed XRL framework effectively generates and refines textual explanations into transparent rules, addressing quality and evaluation challenges in existing methods. It shows promise for both reproducibility in open-source environments and industrial applicability in telecom use cases.

Abstract: Understanding a Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy is crucial for ensuring that autonomous agents behave according to human expectations. This goal can be achieved using Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) techniques. Although textual explanations are easily understood by humans, ensuring their correctness remains a challenge, and evaluations in state-of-the-art remain limited. We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework. This framework addresses the limitations of an existing method, Autonomous Policy Explanation, and the generated transparent rules can achieve satisfactory performance on certain tasks. This framework also enables a systematic and quantitative evaluation of textual explanations, providing valuable insights for the XRL field.

### [3] [SimpleMem: Efficient Lifelong Memory for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02553)
*Jiaqi Liu,Yaofeng Su,Peng Xia,Siwei Han,Zeyu Zheng,Cihang Xie,Mingyu Ding,Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework for LLM agents using semantic lossless compression to improve performance and reduce token costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory systems for LLM agents either cause redundancy by storing full histories or incur high token costs from iterative reasoning, hindering reliable long-term interaction in complex environments.

Method: Proposes a three-stage pipeline: Semantic Structured Compression distills interactions into compact memory units; Recursive Memory Consolidation integrates units into abstract representations to reduce redundancy; Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, with 26.4% average F1 improvement and up to 30-fold reduction in inference-time token consumption.

Conclusion: SimpleMem demonstrates a superior balance between performance and efficiency, enabling more reliable long-term interactions for LLM agents through efficient memory management.

Abstract: To support reliable long-term interaction in complex environments, LLM agents require memory systems that efficiently manage historical experiences. Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) \textit{Semantic Structured Compression}, which applies entropy-aware filtering to distill unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) \textit{Recursive Memory Consolidation}, an asynchronous process that integrates related units into higher-level abstract representations to reduce redundancy; and (3) \textit{Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval}, which dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity to construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency.

### [4] [Orchestral AI: A Framework for Agent Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02577)
*Alexander Roman,Jacob Roman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Orchestral addresses the challenge of building portable LLM agents by providing a lightweight Python framework with a unified interface across providers, supporting advanced features while maintaining simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of LLM agent frameworks leads to vendor lock-in or complex ecosystems, hindering portability and reproducibility due to fragmented APIs, incompatible formats, and inconsistent behavior across providers.

Method: Introduces Orchestral, a framework with a unified type-safe interface, universal representations for messages and tools, automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints, a synchronous execution model with streaming, and modular architecture for clean separation of components.

Result: Enables seamless operation across major LLM providers, eliminates manual format translation, reduces complexity, supports deterministic behavior and real-time interaction, and offers advanced capabilities like tool calling, context compaction, and memory management.

Conclusion: Orchestral provides a practical solution for building reliable, portable LLM agent systems that balance simplicity and extensibility, overcoming engineering challenges in multi-provider integration.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.

### [5] [An Empirical Study of On-Device Translation for Real-Time Live-Stream Chat on Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02641)
*Jeiyoon Park,Daehwan Lee,Changmin Yeo,Yongshin Han,Minseop Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Practical on-device AI deployment requires addressing resource constraints and domain adaptation; proposed approach matches commercial model performance on live-stream chat translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a research gap in practical deployment aspects of on-device AI models, specifically CPU utilization and thermal conditions, needed for real-world service deployment.

Method: Extensive experiments with five mobile devices using LiveChatBench (1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs) to analyze resource consumption and domain adaptation capabilities of on-device models.

Result: The proposed approach achieves performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-5.1 on targeted tasks, despite the need for careful consideration of deployment constraints and model selection for heterogeneous user bases.

Conclusion: On-device AI deployment is feasible for real-world services with careful model selection and adaptation, achieving performance comparable to commercial cloud-based models while addressing deployment constraints.

Abstract: Despite its efficiency, there has been little research on the practical aspects required for real-world deployment of on-device AI models, such as the device's CPU utilization and thermal conditions. In this paper, through extensive experiments, we investigate two key issues that must be addressed to deploy on-device models in real-world services: (i) the selection of on-device models and the resource consumption of each model, and (ii) the capability and potential of on-device models for domain adaptation. To this end, we focus on a task of translating live-stream chat messages and manually construct LiveChatBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs. Experiments on five mobile devices demonstrate that, although serving a large and heterogeneous user base requires careful consideration of highly constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach nevertheless achieves performance comparable to commercial models such as GPT-5.1 on the well-targeted task. We expect that our findings will provide meaningful insights to the on-device AI community.

### [6] [AWARE-US: Benchmark for Preference-Aware Resolution in Tool-Calling Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02643)
*Mehmet Kurmaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of underspecification and infeasibility in tool-calling conversational agents that query structured databases, proposing a preference-aware query repair method using LLMs to relax constraints based on user importance, with local weighting showing best preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When conversational agents encounter infeasible queries, current methods either return 'no results' or use ad hoc constraint relaxation, which may violate user intent by discarding important constraints.

Method: Three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: local weighting, global one-shot weighting, and pairwise ranking, along with the introduction of the AWARE-US benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Experiments indicate local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation.

Conclusion: The approach frames infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem, emphasizing relaxing the least important constraints to the user to improve agent performance.

Abstract: Tool-calling conversational agents querying structured databases often face two linked failures: underspecification (missing constraints needed to run a precise query) and infeasibility (the fully specified query returns an empty set because no item satisfies all constraints). Existing work often responds with "no results" or relaxes constraints using ad hoc rules, which can violate user intent by discarding requirements the user cares about most. We frame infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem: when a query is unsatisfiable, the agent should relax the least important constraints to the user. We propose three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Experiments show local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation. We also introduce AWARE-US, a benchmark of persona-grounded queries requiring agents to disambiguate requests via conversation and resolve infeasibility in a way consistent with persona-implied preferences.

### [7] [Inferring Causal Graph Temporal Logic Formulas to Expedite Reinforcement Learning in Temporally Extended Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02666)
*Hadi Partovi Aria,Zhe Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GTL-CIRL learns policies and mines causal specifications in temporal graphs, using robustness-based rewards and Gaussian Process optimization for efficiency, outperforming RL baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box RL often ignores network propagation effects, limiting sample efficiency and interpretability in spatial-temporal decision tasks.

Method: Simultaneously learns policies and mines Causal GTL specifications, using robustness-based reward shaping, counterexample collection, and GP Bayesian optimization for parameter refinement.

Result: Case studies in gene and power networks show faster learning and clearer, verifiable behavior compared to standard RL.

Conclusion: The proposed closed-loop framework enhances efficiency and interpretability in spatial-temporal decision-making.

Abstract: Decision-making tasks often unfold on graphs with spatial-temporal dynamics. Black-box reinforcement learning often overlooks how local changes spread through network structure, limiting sample efficiency and interpretability. We present GTL-CIRL, a closed-loop framework that simultaneously learns policies and mines Causal Graph Temporal Logic (Causal GTL) specifications. The method shapes rewards with robustness, collects counterexamples when effects fail, and uses Gaussian Process (GP) driven Bayesian optimization to refine parameterized cause templates. The GP models capture spatial and temporal correlations in the system dynamics, enabling efficient exploration of complex parameter spaces. Case studies in gene and power networks show faster learning and clearer, verifiable behavior compared to standard RL baselines.

### [8] [Learning from Prompt itself: the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02683)
*Dongyu Chen,Jian Ma,Xianpeng Zhang,Lei Zhang,Haonan Lu,Chen Chen,Chuangchuang Wang,Kai Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes HAPO framework with dynamic attribution, semantic-unit optimization, and multimodal support to solve prompt drift and interpretability issues, showing better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current prompt optimization methods, including prompt drift (where optimized prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks) and compromised interpretability when generating prompts from scratch.

Method: The framework introduces three innovations: 1) a dynamic attribution mechanism that targets error patterns in training data and prompting history, 2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and 3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows. The method is applied to contexts like single/multi-image QA and complex task analysis.

Result: HAPO demonstrates enhanced optimization efficiency and outperforms comparable automated prompt optimization methods across tasks like single/multi-image QA and complex task analysis.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that HAPO provides an effective and extensible framework for scalable prompt engineering, addressing critical gaps in existing methods and offering a reliable approach for improving LLM performance.

Abstract: Optimization is fundamental across numerous disciplines, typically following an iterative process of refining an initial solution to enhance performance. This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows. Applied in contexts like single/multi-image QA (e.g., OCRV2) and complex task analysis (e.g., BBH), HAPO demonstrates enhanced optimization efficiency, outperforming comparable automated prompt optimization methods and establishing an extensible paradigm for scalable prompt engineering.

### [9] [Learning User Preferences Through Interaction for Long-Term Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02702)
*Shuhaib Mehri,Priyanka Kargupta,Tal August,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MultiSessionCollab benchmark for agent adaptation to user preferences with memory for long-term collaboration improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting to user preferences is essential for conversational agents in long-term relationships and collaboration quality, but lacks a dedicated benchmark.

Method: Introduce MultiSessionCollab benchmark and equip agents with persistent memory to learn and refine user preferences from accumulated interactions, using learning signals from user simulators.

Result: Agents with memory achieve higher task success rates, more efficient interactions, and reduced user effort in experiments; human study confirms improved user experience.

Conclusion: Memory-based agents enhance long-term collaboration by effectively learning and leveraging user preferences, as validated in MultiSessionCollab.

Abstract: As conversational agents accumulate experience collaborating with users, adapting to user preferences is essential for fostering long-term relationships and improving collaboration quality over time. We introduce MultiSessionCollab, a benchmark that evaluates how well agents can learn user preferences and leverage them to improve collaboration quality throughout multiple sessions. To develop agents that succeed in this setting, we present long-term collaborative agents equipped with a memory that persists and refines user preference as interaction experience accumulates. Moreover, we demonstrate that learning signals can be derived from user simulator behavior in MultiSessionCollab to train agents to generate more comprehensive reflections and update their memory more effectively. Extensive experiments show that equipping agents with memory improves long-term collaboration, yielding higher task success rates, more efficient interactions, and reduced user effort. Finally, we conduct a human user study that demonstrates that memory helps improve user experience in real-world settings.

### [10] [Time-Scaling Is What Agents Need Now](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02714)
*Zhi Liu,Guangzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the convergence of AI paradigms into cognitive agents and introduces 'Time-Scaling' as a key approach to enhance reasoning by extending reasoning capabilities over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early AI paradigms were separated (Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Symbolic AI), but Transformer-based models are converging them into closed-loop cognitive agents. However, large language models (LLMs) initially lacked robust semantic reasoning, despite improvements from methods like CoT and ToT, which still have limitations in search completeness and efficiency.

Method: Proposes 'Time-Scaling' as a systematic architectural design that utilizes extended temporal pathways for reasoning. This involves unfolding reasoning over time to enable deeper exploration of problem spaces, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control, similar to human sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints.

Result: Time-Scaling is presented as a critical frontier to enhance deep reasoning and problem-solving without proportionally increasing static model parameters. It focuses on optimizing agents' ability to manage reasoning trajectories over time, addressing limitations in current methods.

Conclusion: Advancing intelligent agent capabilities requires prioritizing Time-Scaling principles, positioning explicit temporal reasoning management as foundational for enhancing cognitive agents' reasoning and problem-solving abilities.

Abstract: Early artificial intelligence paradigms exhibited separated cognitive functions: Neural Networks focused on "perception-representation," Reinforcement Learning on "decision-making-behavior," and Symbolic AI on "knowledge-reasoning." With Transformer-based large models and world models, these paradigms are converging into cognitive agents with closed-loop "perception-decision-action" capabilities.
  Humans solve complex problems under limited cognitive resources through temporalized sequential reasoning. Language relies on problem space search for deep semantic reasoning. While early large language models (LLMs) could generate fluent text, they lacked robust semantic reasoning capabilities. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) extended reasoning paths by making intermediate steps explicit. Recent models like DeepSeek-R1 enhanced performance through explicit reasoning trajectories. However, these methods have limitations in search completeness and efficiency.
  This highlights the need for "Time-Scaling"--the systematic extension and optimization of an agent's ability to unfold reasoning over time. Time-Scaling refers to architectural design utilizing extended temporal pathways, enabling deeper problem space exploration, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control, paralleling human sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints. It represents a critical frontier for enhancing deep reasoning and problem-solving without proportional increases in static model parameters. Advancing intelligent agent capabilities requires placing Time-Scaling principles at the forefront, positioning explicit temporal reasoning management as foundational.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text generators to autonomous, goal-driven systems represents a fundamental shift in artificial intelligence. This chapter examines the emergence of agentic AI systems that integrate planning, memory, tool use, and iterative reasoning to operate autonomously in complex environments. We trace the architectural progression from statistical models to transformer-based systems, identifying capabilities that enable agentic behavior: long-range reasoning, contextual awareness, and adaptive decision-making. The chapter provides three contributions: (1) a synthesis of how LLM capabilities extend toward agency through reasoning-action-reflection loops; (2) an integrative framework describing core components perception, memory, planning, and tool execution that bridge LLMs with autonomous behavior; (3) a critical assessment of applications and persistent challenges in safety, alignment, reliability, and sustainability. Unlike existing surveys, we focus on the architectural transition from language understanding to autonomous action, emphasizing the technical gaps that must be resolved before deployment. We identify critical research priorities, including verifiable planning, scalable multi-agent coordination, persistent memory architectures, and governance frameworks. Responsible advancement requires simultaneous progress in technical robustness, interpretability, and ethical safeguards to realize potential while mitigating risks of misalignment and unintended consequences.

### [13] [HAL: Inducing Human-likeness in LLMs with Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02813)
*Masum Hasan,Junjie Zhao,Ehsan Hoque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAL is a framework for aligning LLMs to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable data-driven reward derived from explicit conversational traits, improving human-like perception without harming overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational human-likeness is important for human-AI interaction but hard to define, measure, and optimize, leading to improvements driven by scale or broad supervised training rather than targeted alignment.

Method: HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods.

Result: Models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in large-scale human evaluations, without affecting overall performance, and allow for inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects.

Conclusion: HAL demonstrates that qualitative properties like conversational human-likeness can be precisely measured and aligned using interpretable traits derived from data, offering a transparent and explainable alternative to scaling and broad supervised training.

Abstract: Conversational human-likeness plays a central role in human-AI interaction, yet it has remained difficult to define, measure, and optimize. As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way.

*Duc Ngo,Arya Rahgoza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalAgent, a causal graph-enhanced RAG system, achieves high accuracy and zero hallucinations in systematic review tasks for dementia exercise research, outperforming baseline AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic reviews are crucial in evidence-based medicine but infeasible manually due to over 1.5 million annual publications; current AI methods have unacceptable hallucination rates (2-40%) that risk patient care.

Method: Developed a retrieval-augmented generation system integrated with explicit causal reasoning and dual-level knowledge graphs, enforcing evidence-first protocols with retrieved literature and generating directed acyclic graphs for intervention-outcome pathways.

Result: On 234 dementia exercise abstracts, CausalAgent achieved 95% accuracy, 100% retrieval success, and zero hallucinations, compared to 34% accuracy and 10% hallucinations for baseline AI.

Conclusion: The architectural approach, though proof-of-concept in dementia exercise research, demonstrates transferable principles for trustworthy medical AI and highlights causal reasoning's potential in high-stakes healthcare.

Abstract: Systematic reviews are essential for evidence-based medicine, but reviewing 1.5 million+ annual publications manually is infeasible. Current AI approaches suffer from hallucinations in systematic review tasks, with studies reporting rates ranging from 28--40% for earlier models to 2--15% for modern implementations which is unacceptable when errors impact patient care.
  We present a causal graph-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation system integrating explicit causal reasoning with dual-level knowledge graphs. Our approach enforces evidence-first protocols where every causal claim traces to retrieved literature and automatically generates directed acyclic graphs visualizing intervention-outcome pathways.
  Evaluation on 234 dementia exercise abstracts shows CausalAgent achieves 95% accuracy, 100% retrieval success, and zero hallucinations versus 34% accuracy and 10% hallucinations for baseline AI. Automatic causal graphs enable explicit mechanism modeling, visual synthesis, and enhanced interpretability. While this proof-of-concept evaluation used ten questions focused on dementia exercise research, the architectural approach demonstrates transferable principles for trustworthy medical AI and causal reasoning's potential for high-stakes healthcare.

*Muzhen Zhang,Yujie Cheng,Zhanxiang Lei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study introduces a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model for spatial prediction of reservoir permeability, achieving significant error reduction compared to traditional methods through quantum circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spatial prediction of reservoir parameters like permeability are unreliable due to high variability and wide ranges, necessitating improved models for oil and gas exploration.

Method: The study presents a QLSTMA model that integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into recurrent cells, utilizing quantum entanglement and superposition. Two structures—QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG)—are explored to assess quantum configurations and qubit count effects.

Result: Experimental results show the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model outperforms traditional LSTMA, reducing MAE by 19% and RMSE by 20%, especially in complex well-logging data areas. Increasing qubits further enhances accuracy in classical simulations.

Conclusion: This study validates quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, establishing a foundational framework for future deployment on real quantum hardware and broader applications in petroleum engineering.

Abstract: Spatial prediction of reservoir parameters, especially permeability, is crucial for oil and gas exploration and development. However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations. This study establishes a foundational framework for the eventual deployment of such models on real quantum hardware and their extension to broader applications in petroleum engineering and geoscience.

*Celeste Veronese,Daniele Meli,Alessandro Farinelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic deep reinforcement learning approach that uses symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency, generalization, and interpretability in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art Deep RL algorithms often require large datasets and struggle with generalization, especially in unseen or complex tasks, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: The approach integrates symbolic knowledge by representing partial policies as logical rules for simple domains and transferring them as priors. It uses online reasoning to guide training through action distribution biasing during exploration and Q-value rescaling during exploitation.

Result: Empirical validation on challenging gridworld variants shows improved performance over a baseline, with better sample efficiency, generalization, and convergence in sparse-reward and long-horizon tasks in both observable and partially observable settings.

Conclusion: The neuro-symbolic integration enhances DRL by providing interpretable, trustworthy priors that accelerate learning and improve generalization, offering a promising direction for more practical RL applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-established framework for sequential decision-making in complex environments. However, state-of-the-art Deep RL (DRL) algorithms typically require large training datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks. We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons. We empirically validate our methodology on challenging variants of gridworld environments, both in the fully observable and partially observable setting. We show improved performance over a state-of-the-art reward machine baseline.

### [17] [M3MAD-Bench: Are Multi-Agent Debates Really Effective Across Domains and Modalities?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02854)
*Ao Li,Jinghui Zhang,Luyu Li,Yuxiang Duan,Lang Gao,Mingcai Chen,Weijun Qin,Shaopeng Li,Fengxian Ji,Ning Liu,Lizhen Cui,Xiuying Chen,Yuntao Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduced M3MAD-Bench as a unified benchmark for Multi-Agent Debate evaluation across tasks, modalities, and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks fair comparisons due to fragmented settings and is limited to single-modality (text-only) scenarios.

Method: Built a benchmark with standardized protocols covering five task domains and both pure text and vision-language datasets, evaluating nine base models.

Result: Provided systematic insights into effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD, including trade-offs via metrics like token consumption and inference time.

Conclusion: M3MAD-Bench establishes a reliable foundation for standardized MAD evaluation to advance future research.

Abstract: As an agent-level reasoning and coordination paradigm, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) orchestrates multiple agents through structured debate to improve answer quality and support complex reasoning. However, existing research on MAD suffers from two fundamental limitations: evaluations are conducted under fragmented and inconsistent settings, hindering fair comparison, and are largely restricted to single-modality scenarios that rely on textual inputs only. To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs. Extensive experiments yield systematic insights into the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD across text-only and multimodal scenarios. We believe M3MAD-Bench offers a reliable foundation for future research on standardized MAD evaluation. The code is available at http://github.com/liaolea/M3MAD-Bench.

### [18] [SimRPD: Optimizing Recruitment Proactive Dialogue Agents through Simulator-Based Data Evaluation and Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02871)
*Zhiyong Cao,Dunqiang Liu,Qi Dai,Haojun Xu,Huaiyan Xu,Huan He,Yafei Liu,Siyuan Liu,XiaoLin Lin,Ke Ma,Ruqian Shi,Sijia Yao,Hao Wang,Sicheng Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimRPD, a three-stage framework using a user simulator and multi-dimensional evaluation to train proactive dialogue agents for recruitment, addressing data scarcity and demonstrating improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training task-oriented proactive dialogue agents for recruitment is crucial for achieving specific business outcomes, such as acquiring social-media contacts. However, the effectiveness of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning is limited by the lack of high-quality, goal-oriented domain-specific training data.

Method: The SimRPD framework involves three stages: 1) creating a high-fidelity user simulator to synthesize conversational data via multi-turn online dialogue, 2) developing a multi-dimensional evaluation system with Chain-of-Intention (CoI) metrics (including global-level and instance-level) to assess the simulator and select high-quality data, and 3) training the proactive dialogue agent on the filtered dataset.

Result: In a real-world recruitment scenario, SimRPD shows superior performance compared to existing simulator-based data selection strategies.

Conclusion: SimRPD proves to be an effective framework for training recruitment proactive dialogue agents, showing practical value in industrial deployment and potential for other business-oriented dialogue scenarios.

Abstract: Task-oriented proactive dialogue agents play a pivotal role in recruitment, particularly for steering conversations towards specific business outcomes, such as acquiring social-media contacts for private-channel conversion. Although supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning have proven effective for training such agents, their performance is heavily constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, goal-oriented domain-specific training data. To address this challenge, we propose SimRPD, a three-stage framework for training recruitment proactive dialogue agents. First, we develop a high-fidelity user simulator to synthesize large-scale conversational data through multi-turn online dialogue. Then we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation framework based on Chain-of-Intention (CoI) to comprehensively assess the simulator and effectively select high-quality data, incorporating both global-level and instance-level metrics. Finally, we train the recruitment proactive dialogue agent on the selected dataset. Experiments in a real-world recruitment scenario demonstrate that SimRPD outperforms existing simulator-based data selection strategies, highlighting its practical value for industrial deployment and its potential applicability to other business-oriented dialogue scenarios.

### [19] [ReTreVal: Reasoning Tree with Validation -- A Hybrid Framework for Enhanced LLM Multi-Step Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02880)
*Abhishek HS,Pavan C Shekar,Arpit Jain,Ashwanth Krishnan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReTreVal improves LLM multi-step reasoning via structured tree exploration, self-critique, validation, and memory, excelling over existing methods in math and writing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step reasoning is challenging for LLMs in complex domains like math and creative writing; existing methods lack structured exploration of solutions and persistent learning across problems.

Method: ReTreVal integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration, iterative self-critique and refinement guided by LLM-generated feedback, dual validation mechanisms for reasoning quality and correctness, critique-based pruning to retain top nodes, and reflexion memory storage.

Result: ReTreVal outperformed ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine on 500 math and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B, showing consistent improvement in performance.

Conclusion: ReTreVal is an effective framework that combines structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory to advance multi-step reasoning, outperforming existing methods in tasks requiring rigorous and exploratory reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning remains a key challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in complex domains such as mathematics and creative writing. While recent approaches including ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine improve reasoning through iterative refinement and reflection, they often lack structured exploration of alternative solution paths and persistent learning across problems. We propose ReTreVal (Reasoning Tree with Validation), a hybrid framework that integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration, self-refinement, LLM-based critique scoring, and reflexion memory to enable bounded and validated multi-step reasoning. ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths. We evaluate ReTreVal against ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B as the underlying LLM, and demonstrate that ReTreVal consistently outperforms existing methods through its combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer.

### [20] [Logical Phase Transitions: Understanding Collapse in LLM Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02902)
*Xinglang Zhang,Yunyao Zhang,ZeLiang Chen,Junqing Yu,Wei Yang,Zikai Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM reasoning fails abruptly beyond critical logical depth (phase transitions). Paper identifies this phenomenon and proposes training method that adaptively aligns language with logic symbols, improving high-complexity reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While symbolic reasoning is crucial for high-stakes domains like mathematics and law, understanding failure modes in LLMs is limited. The authors aim to reveal the underlying patterns of these failures to enable more robust solutions.

Method: They propose 'Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning': 1) systematically analyzes logical reasoning under controlled complexity increases to identify phase transitions, 2) aligns natural language with logical symbols adaptively to create shared representations, and 3) reshapes training dynamics at phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning for deeper logical depths.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show their method effectively mitigates performance collapse at high logical complexity, achieving average accuracy gains of +1.26% in naive prompting and +3.95% in chain-of-thought prompting, while also improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that Logical Phase Transitions exist in LLMs' reasoning, and their Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning framework effectively addresses performance collapse at high logical depth, providing both a novel explanation for failure modes and a practical method for improving symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Symbolic logical reasoning is a critical yet underexplored capability of large language models (LLMs), providing reliable and verifiable decision-making in high-stakes domains such as mathematical reasoning and legal judgment. In this study, we present a systematic analysis of logical reasoning under controlled increases in logical complexity, and reveal a previously unrecognized phenomenon, which we term Logical Phase Transitions: rather than degrading smoothly, logical reasoning performance remains stable within a regime but collapses abruptly beyond a critical logical depth, mirroring physical phase transitions such as water freezing beyond a critical temperature threshold. Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

### [21] [Batch-of-Thought: Cross-Instance Learning for Enhanced LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02950)
*Xuan Yang,Furong Jia,Roy Xie,Xiong Xi,Hengwei Bian,Jian Li,Monica Agrawal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Batch-of-Thought enables joint processing of related queries to capture cross-instance signals, improving accuracy, calibration and reducing inference costs by 61% through template identification and consistency checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning systems process queries independently, discarding valuable cross-instance signals like shared reasoning patterns and consistency constraints, leading to inefficiencies and missed optimization opportunities.

Method: Batch-of-Think (BoT) employs joint processing of related queries to enable cross-instance learning, using comparative analysis to identify high-quality reasoning templates, detect errors via consistency checks, and amortize computational costs. BoT-R instantiates this within a multi-agent reflection architecture with a Reflector performing joint evaluation.

Result: Experiments across three model families and six benchmarks show BoT-R consistently improves accuracy and confidence calibration while reducing inference costs by up to 61%, with theoretical and experimental analysis revealing when and why batch-aware reasoning benefits LLM systems.

Conclusion: Batch-of-Thought provides an effective training-free approach to improve LLM reasoning through batch-aware joint processing, achieving consistent performance gains across diverse models and benchmarks while significantly reducing inference costs.

Abstract: Current Large Language Model reasoning systems process queries independently, discarding valuable cross-instance signals such as shared reasoning patterns and consistency constraints. We introduce Batch-of-Thought (BoT), a training-free method that processes related queries jointly to enable cross-instance learning. By performing comparative analysis across batches, BoT identifies high-quality reasoning templates, detects errors through consistency checks, and amortizes computational costs. We instantiate BoT within a multi-agent reflection architecture (BoT-R), where a Reflector performs joint evaluation to unlock mutual information gain unavailable in isolated processing. Experiments across three model families and six benchmarks demonstrate that BoT-R consistently improves accuracy and confidence calibration while reducing inference costs by up to 61%. Our theoretical and experimental analysis reveals when and why batch-aware reasoning benefits LLM systems.

### [22] [Rationale-Grounded In-Context Learning for Time Series Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02968)
*Qingxiang Liu,Zhiqing Cui,Xiaoliang Luo,Yuqian Wu,Zhuoyang Jiang,Huaiyu Wan,Sheng Sun,Lvchun Wang,Wei Yu,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents RationaleTS, a new in-context learning method that grounds time series reasoning in human-like rationales. It generates explicit reasoning paths from data to outcomes and uses a hybrid retrieval system to fetch relevant rationales for new samples, addressing the pattern-matching weakness of existing multimodal LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a key shortcoming in existing multimodal large language models (LLMs) for time series analysis: lack of 'rationale priors' connecting temporal observations to outcomes. This forces the models into superficial pattern matching rather than engaging in principled, stepwise reasoning needed for accurate time series analysis, causing underperformance in reasoning tasks.

Method: The primary method is 'RationaleTS', a rationale-grounded in-context learning framework. It involves two key steps: 1) Inducing 'label-conditioned rationales' that form reasoning paths from observational evidence to potential outcomes, establishing explicit reasoning units. 2) Designing a 'hybrid retrieval' mechanism that balances temporal patterns and semantic contexts to select the most relevant rationale priors from the training set for final in-context inference on new samples.

Result: The experimental evaluation demonstrates the 'effectiveness and efficiency' of RationaleTS across time series reasoning tasks in three domains, indicating it outperforms baseline models on these tasks. The authors commit to releasing their code for reproducibility.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that the RationaleTS method, with its rationale-grounded in-context learning approach leveraging explicit reasoning guides, effectively addresses the core limitation of existing multimodal LLMs in time series reasoning, moving beyond pattern matching to deliver superior performance efficiently on diverse tasks.

Abstract: The underperformance of existing multimodal large language models for time series reasoning lies in the absence of rationale priors that connect temporal observations to their downstream outcomes, which leads models to rely on superficial pattern matching rather than principled reasoning. We therefore propose the rationale-grounded in-context learning for time series reasoning, where rationales work as guiding reasoning units rather than post-hoc explanations, and develop the RationaleTS method. Specifically, we firstly induce label-conditioned rationales, composed of reasoning paths from observable evidence to the potential outcomes. Then, we design the hybrid retrieval by balancing temporal patterns and semantic contexts to retrieve correlated rationale priors for the final in-context inference on new samples. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RationaleTS on three-domain time series reasoning tasks. We will release our code for reproduction.

*Qusai Khaled,Pasquale De Marinis,Moez Louati,David Ferras,Laura Genga,Uzay Kaymak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An explainable Graph Neural Network framework is proposed for leak detection in water distribution networks, combining mutual information and fuzzy logic to offer rule-based explanations, balancing performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely leak detection is critical for conserving resources and operational efficiency, but Graph Neural Networks' black-box nature and lack of explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption.

Method: The framework integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic for clear explanations. After benchmarking GNN architectures, the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) was selected, leading to a fuzzy-enhanced variant (FGENConv) for node classification tasks.

Result: FGENConv achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below GENConv's 0.938 and 0.858, but provides spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations.

Conclusion: The fuzzy network offers a balance between precision and explainability, enabling hydraulic engineers to validate leak locations, conserve resources, and optimize maintenance strategies, with accessible code on GitHub.

Abstract: Timely leak detection in water distribution networks is critical for conserving resources and maintaining operational efficiency. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations. By striking the right balance between precision and explainability, the proposed fuzzy network could enable hydraulic engineers to validate predicted leak locations, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies.

TL;DR: An industry-academic collaboration developed a probabilistic Digital Twin of UK airspace for training AI ATC agents, proposing an assurance framework based on Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance to meet regulatory requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital Twins offer significant benefits in aviation, but their novel nature requires specific regulatory frameworks. There is a need to ensure Digital Twins accurately represent physical systems and are functionally adequate for training and testing AI in Air Traffic Control, motivating the development of a structured assurance approach.

Method: The paper leverages emerging guidance for Digital Twin development and AI/ML in Air Traffic Management to create an assurance framework. It uses Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance methodology to build an assurance case with structured arguments, evidence, assumptions, and justifications, including deep dives into specific aspects.

Result: An assurance framework is presented, defining actionable goals and required evidence to demonstrate Digital Twin accuracy and functionality. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess and document the Digital Twin's strengths and limitations, and serves as a foundation for stakeholder and regulatory engagement.

Conclusion: The framework contributes to the regulatory landscape for Digital Twins in aviation by offering a concrete example and supporting discussions on future applications, highlighting the potential of Digital Twins in AI Air Traffic Control with assured trustworthiness and ethics.

Abstract: Digital Twins combine simulation, operational data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and have the potential to bring significant benefits across the aviation industry. Project Bluebird, an industry-academic collaboration, has developed a probabilistic Digital Twin of en route UK airspace as an environment for training and testing AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) agents. There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case.
  We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin.
  The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case. An assurance case is a nested set of structured arguments that provides justified evidence for how a top-level goal has been realised. In this paper we provide an overview of each structured argument and a number of deep dives which elaborate in more detail upon particular arguments, including the required evidence, assumptions and justifications.

Motivation: To address the gap in existing work on cryptic column name expansion (CNE) in database tables, which is critical for data search, access, and understanding, and to explore automatic prompt engineering beyond English applications for the first time.

Method: The system is designed to be simpler in both design and application, requiring no tuning and no explicit clues about the task. It was evaluated on CNE tasks using datasets in English and German.

Result: The approach was evaluated on datasets in two languages, English and German, demonstrating its effectiveness as the first work to report on automatic prompt engineering for the CNE task and for a non-English language.

Conclusion: The paper successfully presents a system for automatic prompt engineering that is as effective as existing approaches but simpler, achieving novel results in the CNE task across multiple languages, opening up possibilities for further research in this domain.

Abstract: This paper presents a system for automatic prompt engineering that is much simpler in both design and application and yet as effective as the existing approaches. It requires no tuning and no explicit clues about the task. We evaluated our approach on cryptic column name expansion (CNE) in database tables, a task which is critical for tabular data search, access, and understanding and yet there has been very little existing work. We evaluated on datasets in two languages, English and German. This is the first work to report on the application of automatic prompt engineering for the CNE task. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work on the application of automatic prompt engineering for a language other than English.

TL;DR: MAGMA introduces a multi-graph memory architecture with separate semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs to improve long-context reasoning in LLMs, outperforming existing memory systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Memory-Augmented Generation (MAG) approaches rely on monolithic memory stores, entangling different types of information and limiting interpretability and reasoning accuracy.

Method: Proposes MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents memory items across orthogonal graphs and uses policy-guided traversal for query-adaptive retrieval.

Result: Experiments on datasets like LoCoMo and LongMemEval show that MAGMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agentic memory systems in long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: MAGMA provides more transparent and accurate reasoning by decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic, enhancing interpretability and control in long-context applications.

Abstract: Memory-Augmented Generation (MAG) extends Large Language Models with external memory to support long-context reasoning, but existing approaches largely rely on semantic similarity over monolithic memory stores, entangling temporal, causal, and entity information. This design limits interpretability and alignment between query intent and retrieved evidence, leading to suboptimal reasoning accuracy. In this paper, we propose MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs. MAGMA formulates retrieval as policy-guided traversal over these relational views, enabling query-adaptive selection and structured context construction. By decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic, MAGMA provides transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained control over retrieval. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval demonstrate that MAGMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agentic memory systems in long-horizon reasoning tasks.

*Wenzhao Jiang,Jindong Han,Ruiqian Han,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MixTTE is a scalable framework integrating link-level modeling with existing route-level travel time estimation systems to improve accuracy in large urban networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate travel time estimation is critical for ride-hailing platforms, but current systems fail to capture city-scale traffic dynamics and long-tail scenarios, causing unreliable predictions.

Method: The framework includes a spatio-temporal external attention module for global traffic dependencies, a stabilized graph mixture-of-experts network for heterogeneous patterns, and an asynchronous incremental learning strategy for real-time adaptation.

Result: Experiments show MixTTE significantly reduces prediction errors compared to seven baselines, and it has been deployed in DiDi to enhance service accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: MixTTE effectively addresses scalability and adaptation challenges in travel time estimation, proving suitable for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Accurate Travel Time Estimation (TTE) is critical for ride-hailing platforms, where errors directly impact user experience and operational efficiency. While existing production systems excel at holistic route-level dependency modeling, they struggle to capture city-scale traffic dynamics and long-tail scenarios, leading to unreliable predictions in large urban networks. In this paper, we propose \model, a scalable and adaptive framework that synergistically integrates link-level modeling with industrial route-level TTE systems. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal external attention module to capture global traffic dynamic dependencies across million-scale road networks efficiently. Moreover, we construct a stabilized graph mixture-of-experts network to handle heterogeneous traffic patterns while maintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, an asynchronous incremental learning strategy is tailored to enable real-time and stable adaptation to dynamic traffic distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world datasets validate MixTTE significantly reduces prediction errors compared to seven baselines. MixTTE has been deployed in DiDi, substantially improving the accuracy and stability of the TTE service.

### [28] [Physical Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02433)
*Tao Xu,Zhixin Hu,Li Luo,Momiao Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes physical transformer that couples transformer computation with physical dynamics through hierarchical architecture, showing improved stability and geometric fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems operate primarily in digital/symbolic domains without physical grounding or interpretability, lacking connection to real-world physical dynamics and geometric structure.

Method: Uses three-level hierarchical transformer architecture: micro-level spin models, meso-level Hamiltonian flows on neural differential manifolds with HJB control, and macro-level semantic workspace with information-phase portraits.

Result: Physical transformer demonstrates improved stability and long-horizon accuracy on simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems compared to naive baselines.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the benefits of using a physical transformer in modeling by showing superior stability and performance in tasks with underlying geometric structure, suggesting a path toward more interpretable and unified physical AI systems.

Abstract: Digital AI systems spanning large language models, vision models, and generative architectures that operate primarily in symbolic, linguistic, or pixel domains. They have achieved striking progress, but almost all of this progress lives in virtual spaces. These systems transform embeddings and tokens, yet do not themselves touch the world and rarely admit a physical interpretation. In this work we propose a physical transformer that couples modern transformer style computation with geometric representation and physical dynamics. At the micro level, attention heads, and feed-forward blocks are modeled as interacting spins governed by effective Hamiltonians plus non-Hamiltonian bath terms. At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure. More broadly, the framework suggests a path toward physical AI that unify digital reasoning with physically grounded manifolds, opening a route to more interpretable and potentially unified models of reasoning, control, and interaction with the real world.

### [29] [WebGym: Scaling Training Environments for Visual Web Agents with Realistic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02439)
*Hao Bai,Alexey Taymanov,Tong Zhang,Aviral Kumar,Spencer Whitehead*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WebGym, a large-scale open-source environment for training visual web agents, includes hundreds of thousands of tasks on real websites, uses RL with task rewards, and a high-throughput rollout system for efficiency, achieving significant performance gains on unseen test sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web agent training environments are limited by artificial or small-scale tasks, which fail to capture the non-stationarity and diversity of real websites, hindering robust policy learning.

Method: Develop WebGym with a rubric-based evaluation, implement a simple RL recipe using agent interactions and task rewards, and create a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system to speed up trajectory sampling.

Result: WebGym achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup; fine-tuning the Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct model on WebGym increases success rate from 26.2% to 42.9% on an out-of-distribution test set, outperforming GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking.

Conclusion: WebGym demonstrates that scaling task diversity, depth, and RL efficiency is essential for training robust visual web agents, with open-source models achieving significant improvement over proprietary ones on unseen websites.

Abstract: We present WebGym, the largest-to-date open-source environment for training realistic visual web agents. Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively. This improvement is substantial because our test set consists only of tasks on websites never seen during training, unlike many other prior works on training visual web agents.

*Subhankar Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: mHC-GNN adapts manifold-constrained hyper-connections to GNNs, slowing over-smoothing exponentially and enhancing expressive power beyond 1-WL, with significant gains in deep layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs face issues with over-smoothing in deep architectures and limited expressiveness bounded by the 1-WL test, hindering their performance in complex graph tasks.

Method: The method expands node representations across parallel streams and constrains stream-mixing matrices to the Birkhoff polytope using Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization, adapting MHC for GNNs.

Result: Experiments on 10 datasets with 4 GNN architectures show consistent improvements; mHC-GNN maintains over 74% accuracy at 128 layers, while standard GNNs collapse beyond 16 layers, with up to 50+ percentage point gains at extreme depths.

Conclusion: mHC-GNN effectively mitigates over-smoothing and enhances expressive power beyond 1-WL, proving robust in deep architectures, with the manifold constraint being crucial for performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from over-smoothing in deep architectures and expressiveness bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test. We adapt Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (\mhc)~\citep{xie2025mhc}, recently proposed for Transformers, to graph neural networks. Our method, mHC-GNN, expands node representations across $n$ parallel streams and constrains stream-mixing matrices to the Birkhoff polytope via Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization. We prove that mHC-GNN exhibits exponentially slower over-smoothing (rate $(1-γ)^{L/n}$ vs.\ $(1-γ)^L$) and can distinguish graphs beyond 1-WL. Experiments on 10 datasets with 4 GNN architectures show consistent improvements. Depth experiments from 2 to 128 layers reveal that standard GNNs collapse to near-random performance beyond 16 layers, while mHC-GNN maintains over 74\% accuracy even at 128 layers, with improvements exceeding 50 percentage points at extreme depths. Ablations confirm that the manifold constraint is essential: removing it causes up to 82\% performance degradation.

### [31] [Polynomial Convergence of Riemannian Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02499)
*Xingyu Xu,Ziyi Zhang,Yorie Nakahira,Guannan Qu,Yuejie Chi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract strengthens the theory of Riemannian diffusion models by showing that a polynomially small step size suffices for small sampling error under L2-accurate score estimates, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution, using Li-Yau and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are effective for generative AI, but existing literature assumes Euclidean spaces. In practice, data often lie on submanifolds, and prior work like De Bortoli et al. (2022) required exponentially small step size and strict conditions (smooth, positive data, L∞-accurate score). This paper aims to relax these requirements for broader applicability.

Method: The method involves analyzing Riemannian diffusion models under mild curvature assumptions on manifolds. Key tools are the Li-Yau estimate for the log-gradient of the heat kernel and the Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion of the perturbed heat equation to bound sampling errors.

Result: The result establishes that with an L2-accurate score estimate, a polynomially small step size is sufficient to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, even without smoothness or positivity of the data distribution.

Conclusion: This work strengthens the theoretical foundation of diffusion models on non-Euclidean spaces, enabling more efficient sampling with fewer constraints, and opens avenues for sharper analysis in such contexts.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable empirical success in the recent years and are considered one of the state-of-the-art generative models in modern AI. These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution. Our analysis only requires mild and standard curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold. The main ingredients in our analysis are Li-Yau estimate for the log-gradient of heat kernel, and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion of the perturbed heat equation. Our approach opens the door to a sharper analysis of diffusion models on non-Euclidean spaces.

*Brian Tekmen,Jason Yin,Qianqian Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: I-GEM enables efficient continual learning for LLMs by adapting GEM constraints to LoRA adapter subspace, preserving accuracy while reducing computation by 1000x compared to full GEM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of LLMs is computationally expensive, motivating the exploration of continual learning approaches using parameter-efficient adapters to reduce resource requirements while maintaining performance.

Method: I-GEM: a fixed-budget, GPU-resident dual projected-gradient approximation to GEM's quadratic projection, constraining non-interference solely within adapter parameters via LoRA subspace.

Result: I-GEM matches GEM's average accuracy (within ~0.04 points) on 3-task AG News split with induced domain drift using GPT-2 (355M) and LoRA (r=8), outperforms A-GEM by ~1.4 points, and reduces projection time vs GEM by factor of ~1000.

Conclusion: Applying GEM constraints within the LoRA subspace presents a practical pathway for efficient continual learning at large language model scale, balancing accuracy preservation with dramatically reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally costly, motivating Continual Learning (CL) approaches that utilize parameter-efficient adapters. We revisit Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) within the Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) subspace and introduce I-GEM: a fixed-budget, GPU-resident dual projected-gradient approximation to GEM's quadratic projection. By constraining non-interference solely within the adapter parameters, I-GEM preserves GEM-like stability with orders-of-magnitude lower mean projection overhead. On a 3-task AG News split with induced domain drift, using GPT-2 (355M) and LoRA ($r=8$), I-GEM matches GEM's average accuracy (within $\sim\!0.04$ pts) and outperforms A-GEM by $\sim\!1.4$ pts. Crucially, it reduces projection time vs.\ GEM by a factor of $\sim\!10^3$. These results suggest that applying GEM constraints in the LoRA subspace is a practical pathway for continual learning at the LLM scale.

Abstract: Following the initial publication of hdlib, a Python library for designing Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSA), we introduce a major extension that significantly enhances its machine learning capabilities. VSA, also known as Hyperdimensional Computing, is a computing paradigm that represents and processes information using high-dimensional vectors. While the first version of hdlib established a robust foundation for creating and manipulating these vectors, this update addresses the growing need for more advanced, data-driven modeling within the VSA framework. Here, we present four extensions: significant enhancements to the existing supervised classification model also enabling feature selection, and a new regression model for predicting continuous variables, a clustering model for unsupervised learning, and a graph-based learning model. Furthermore, we propose the first implementation ever of Quantum Hyperdimensional Computing with quantum-powered arithmetic operations and a new Quantum Machine Learning model for supervised learning. hdlib remains open-source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib under the MIT license, and distributed through the Python Package Index (pip install hdlib) and Conda (conda install -c conda-forge hdlib).

*Bahareh Golchin,Banafsheh Rekabdar,Danielle Justo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework integrating LLM-based reward shaping, RL agents, VAE-enhanced scaling, and active learning achieves state-of-the-art time series anomaly detection with limited labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series anomaly detection often suffers from sparse labels, complex temporal patterns, and costly expert annotation, making robust detection challenging under limited labeling budgets and data constraints.

Method: The method integrates LLM-based potential functions for reward shaping with RL, VAE-enhanced dynamic reward scaling, active learning with label propagation, and uses an LSTM-based RL agent guided by LLM-derived semantic rewards.

Result: Evaluations on Yahoo-A1 and SMD benchmarks demonstrate the method achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy under limited labeling budgets and operates effectively in data-constrained settings.

Conclusion: The study concludes that combining LLMs with RL and advanced unsupervised techniques holds promise for robust and scalable anomaly detection in real-world applications.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is crucial for finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring applications. However, time series anomaly detection often suffers from sparse labels, complex temporal patterns, and costly expert annotation. We propose a unified framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-based potential functions for reward shaping with Reinforcement Learning (RL), Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-enhanced dynamic reward scaling, and active learning with label propagation. An LSTM-based RL agent leverages LLM-derived semantic rewards to guide exploration, while VAE reconstruction errors add unsupervised anomaly signals. Active learning selects the most uncertain samples, and label propagation efficiently expands labeled data. Evaluations on Yahoo-A1 and SMD benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy under limited labeling budgets and operates effectively in data-constrained settings. This study highlights the promise of combining LLMs with RL and advanced unsupervised techniques for robust, scalable anomaly detection in real-world applications.

*Zhuoyang Jiang,Yaosen Min,Peiran Jin,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CamS is a graph-to-sequence method that serializes molecular graphs into motifs for decoder-only Transformers, improving molecular property prediction with explicit topology while preserving chemical details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMILES-based methods lack explicit graph topology, while graph-native approaches may disrupt key chemical details like activity cliffs; CamS aims to bridge this gap by integrating connectivity and structural richness.

Method: Mine data-driven connection-aware motifs, serialize them via scaffold-rooted BFS into causal sequences, and concatenate multi-scale sequences for hierarchical modeling in a Transformer backbone.

Result: CamS-LLaMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and MoleculeACE benchmarks, outperforming SMILES-based language models and graph baselines in molecular property prediction.

Conclusion: CamS effectively enables hierarchical modeling of molecular graphs via causal sequences, enhancing interpretability and performance by focusing on critical structural differences like activity cliffs.

Abstract: We present Connection-Aware Motif Sequencing (CamS), a graph-to-sequence representation that enables decoder-only Transformers to learn molecular graphs via standard next-token prediction (NTP). For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines. Interpretability analysis confirms that our multi-scale causal serialization effectively drives attention toward cliff-determining differences.

### [36] [Normalized Conditional Mutual Information Surrogate Loss for Deep Neural Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02543)
*Linfeng Ye,Zhixiang Chi,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis,En-hui Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new loss function, normalized conditional mutual information (NCMI), as a replacement for cross-entropy in training neural network classifiers. Experiments show it significantly and consistently outperforms existing losses on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to improve upon the widely-used cross-entropy (CE) loss by proposing a theoretically sound, information-theoretic alternative based on conditional mutual information.

Method: The authors introduce an alternating algorithm designed to efficiently minimize the normalized conditional mutual information (NCMI) between the classifier's predictions and the true labels.

Result: Experimental results show significant gains: on ImageNet, NCMI improves top-1 accuracy by 2.77% with ResNet-50; on a medical imaging benchmark (CAMELYON-17), replacing CE with NCMI boosts macro-F1 by 8.6%. These improvements are consistent across various model architectures and batch sizes.

Conclusion: Adopting NCMI across these diverse classification tasks leads to substantial and consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art losses (including cross-entropy), suggesting it is a practical and powerful alternative for training deep classifiers.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel information theoretic surrogate loss; normalized conditional mutual information (NCMI); as a drop in alternative to the de facto cross-entropy (CE) for training deep neural network (DNN) based classifiers. We first observe that the model's NCMI is inversely proportional to its accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce an alternating algorithm to efficiently minimize the NCMI. Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline. Gains are consistent across various architectures and batch sizes, suggesting that NCMI is a practical and competitive alternative to CE.

*Rohit Kaushik,Eva Kaushik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Conformal Bayesian Dermatological Classifier (CBDC) combining Statistical Learning Theory, Topological Data Analysis, and Bayesian Conformal Inference for dermatological diagnosis with strong theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models lack well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, hindering deployment in clinical dermatological settings despite high predictive accuracy.

Method: Combines Statistical Learning Theory to provide generalization bounds, Topological Data Analysis for stability under perturbations, and Bayesian Conformal Inference for finite coverage guarantees in uncertainty quantification.

Result: CBDC achieves high classification accuracy and generates clinically interpretable, calibrated predictions on HAM10000, PH2, and ISIC 2020 datasets.

Conclusion: The framework represents a theoretical and practical advance in dermatological diagnostics, bridging machine learning theory with clinical applicability.

Abstract: The rapid growth of dermatological imaging and mobile diagnostic tools calls for systems that not only demonstrate empirical performance but also provide strong theoretical guarantees. Deep learning models have shown high predictive accuracy; however, they are often criticized for lacking well, calibrated uncertainty estimates without which these models are hardly deployable in a clinical setting. To this end, we present the Conformal Bayesian Dermatological Classifier (CBDC), a well, founded framework that combines Statistical Learning Theory, Topological Data Analysis (TDA), and Bayesian Conformal Inference. CBDC offers distribution, dependent generalization bounds that reflect dermatological variability, proves a topological stability theorem that guarantees the invariance of convolutional neural network embeddings under photometric and morphological perturbations and provides finite conformal coverage guarantees for trustworthy uncertainty quantification.
  Through exhaustive experiments on the HAM10000, PH2, and ISIC 2020 datasets, we show that CBDC not only attains classification accuracy but also generates calibrated predictions that are interpretable from a clinical perspective. This research constitutes a theoretical and practical leap for deep dermatological diagnostics, thereby opening the machine learning theory clinical applicability interface.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional credit risk assessment relies on costly feature-based models that don't fully utilize raw credit records, limiting efficiency and scalability.

Method: It leverages a language model to process raw, jargon-heavy text, learning task-relevant representations automatically without manual preprocessing.

Result: Evaluation on real-world data shows LendNova can accurately and efficiently assess risk, reducing costs and improving scalability.

Conclusion: LendNova sets a baseline for intelligent credit risk agents, demonstrating the feasibility of language models in finance and paving the way for more automated financial systems.

Abstract: Credit risk assessment is essential in the financial sector, but has traditionally depended on costly feature-based models that often fail to utilize all available information in raw credit records.

### [39] [Threat Detection in Social Media Networks Using Machine Learning Based Network Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02581)
*Aditi Sanjay Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning framework using artificial neural networks is proposed for detecting malicious behavior in social media networks based on network traffic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media networks face increasing security threats like intrusions and attacks, and traditional rule-based systems are often insufficiently scalable and dynamic to counter these evolving threats.

Method: The paper preprocesses a network traffic dataset to address data imbalance, feature inconsistency, and noise, then builds an artificial neural network (ANN) model to capture complex, non-linear patterns of malicious activities.

Result: The proposed ANN model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, demonstrating strong detection performance and robustness in identifying threats.

Conclusion: Neural network-based solutions are effective for threat detection in large-scale social media networks and can enhance existing intrusion detection systems to support proactive cybersecurity measures.

Abstract: The accelerated development of social media websites has posed intricate security issues in cyberspace, where these sites have increasingly become victims of criminal activities including attempts to intrude into them, abnormal traffic patterns, and organized attacks. The conventional rule-based security systems are not always scalable and dynamic to meet such a threat. This paper introduces a threat detection framework based on machine learning that can be used to classify malicious behavior in the social media network environment based on the nature of network traffic. Exploiting a rich network traffic dataset, the massive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis is conducted to overcome the problem of data imbalance, feature inconsistency, and noise. A model of artificial neural network (ANN) is then created to acquire intricate, non-linear tendencies of malicious actions. The proposed model is tested on conventional performance metrics, such as accuracy, accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, and shows good detection and high levels of strength. The findings suggest that neural network-based solutions have the potential to be used effectively to identify the latent threat dynamics within the context of a large-scale social media network and that they can be employed to complement the existing intrusion detection system and better to conduct proactive cybersecurity operations.

*Arjun S. Nair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chronicals, an open-source training framework, achieves 3.51x speedup over Unsloth for fine-tuning large language models using optimizations like fused kernels, online softmax, LoRA+, and sequence packing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model fine-tuning is memory-intensive; a 7B model requires 84GB (exceeding A100-40GB capacity), so there's a need for efficient frameworks to reduce memory usage and accelerate training.

Method: Implements four optimizations: fused Triton kernels (RMSNorm, SwiGLU, QK-RoPE) reducing memory traffic by 75%, Cut Cross-Entropy with online softmax to cut logit memory from 5GB to 135MB, LoRA+ with 16x differential learning rates, and Best-Fit Decreasing sequence packing recovering 60-75% compute wasted on padding.

Result: Achieves 41,184 tokens/second for full fine-tuning vs. Unsloth's 11,736 tokens/second (3.51x speedup) on Qwen2.5-0.5B with A100-40GB; for LoRA at rank 32, reaches 11,699 tokens/second vs. Unsloth MAX's 2,857 tokens/second (4.10x speedup). Found that Unsloth's benchmark exhibited zero gradient norms.

Conclusion: Chronicals provides an efficient solution with mathematical foundations, improving training speed and memory efficiency for LLM fine-tuning, available as open-source with complete code and proofs.

Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning is bottlenecked by memory: a 7B parameter model requires 84GB--14GB for weights, 14GB for gradients, and 56GB for FP32 optimizer states--exceeding even A100-40GB capacity. We present Chronicals, an open-source training framework achieving 3.51x speedup over Unsloth through four synergistic optimizations: (1) fused Triton kernels eliminating 75% of memory traffic via RMSNorm (7x), SwiGLU (5x), and QK-RoPE (2.3x) fusion; (2) Cut Cross-Entropy reducing logit memory from 5GB to 135MB through online softmax computation; (3) LoRA+ with theoretically-derived 16x differential learning rates between adapter matrices; and (4) Best-Fit Decreasing sequence packing recovering 60-75% of compute wasted on padding.
  On Qwen2.5-0.5B with A100-40GB, Chronicals achieves 41,184 tokens/second for full fine-tuning versus Unsloth's 11,736 tokens/second (3.51x). For LoRA at rank 32, we reach 11,699 tokens/second versus Unsloth MAX's 2,857 tokens/second (4.10x). Critically, we discovered that Unsloth's reported 46,000 tokens/second benchmark exhibited zero gradient norms--the model was not training.
  We provide complete mathematical foundations: online softmax correctness proofs, FlashAttention IO complexity bounds O(N^2 d^2 M^{-1}), LoRA+ learning rate derivations from gradient magnitude analysis, and bin-packing approximation guarantees.

### [41] [Credit Assignment via Neural Manifold Noise Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02636)
*Byungwoo Kang,Maceo Richards,Bernardo Sabatini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Neural Manifold Noise Correlation (NMNC), a biologically inspired method that improves credit assignment in neural networks by restricting noise perturbations to the low-dimensional neural manifold, enhancing performance and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credit assignment is key in learning, but traditional noise correlation methods scale poorly and conflict with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on low-dimensional manifolds. To address this, NMNC restricts perturbations to this manifold.

Method: NMNC performs credit assignment by correlating perturbations strictly within the neural manifold, leveraging theoretical and empirical insights that the Jacobian row space aligns with the manifold and dimensionality scales slowly with network size.

Result: NMNC substantially outperforms vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks, improving performance, sample efficiency, and yielding representations more similar to the primate visual system.

Conclusion: NMNC offers a plausible biological mechanism for credit assignment and suggests that biologically inspired constraints can enable effective large-scale learning, aligning with neurobiological principles and enhancing machine learning methods.

Abstract: Credit assignment--how changes in individual neurons and synapses affect a network's output--is central to learning in brains and machines. Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale.

### [42] [Prioritized Replay for RL Post-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02648)
*Mehdi Fatemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Problem-level prioritization framework for RL post-training of LLMs that selects tasks based on their value as learning signals rather than difficulty, using empirical success statistics and requiring no manual curriculum design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by limitations of conventional curriculum strategies in RL post-training, which often emphasize easier tasks early but don't optimize for maximally informative learning signals. The authors seek to develop an automatic approach that selects problems that neither consistently solved nor consistently failed to provide stronger learning signals under gradient-based methods like GRPO.

Method: The authors propose a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics to select problems. The method employs heap-based prioritized sampling for efficient implementation and includes periodic retesting of solved/unsolved problems to prevent starvation and forgetting.

Result: The framework yields a continuously adapting priority process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. The method shows improved alignment with GRPO-based training dynamics and addresses practical deployment challenges including starvation and forgetting.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that APRICOT's problem-level prioritization framework offers a more efficient and scalable alternative to manual curriculum design for RL post-training of LLMs. By focusing training on problems that maximize gradient information, it enhances learning dynamics and overall training efficiency without requiring external difficulty labels or predefined tiers.

Abstract: We introduce a problem-level prioritization framework for RL post-training of large language models. Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training.

*Bo Jiang,Weijun Zhao,Beibei Wang,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpikingGPF introduces sparse graph prompts using spiking neuron mechanisms to enable selective prompting and improve robustness against noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) learning methods prompt over all node feature dimensions, which is redundant and sensitive to node feature noise. There is a need for more compact and robust prompting.

Method: The proposed SpikingGPF learns sparse prompt vectors using a spiking neuron architecture to enable selective prompting on node features, and employs sparse representation theory to represent each node's prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms, promoting compact and efficient computation.

Result: Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF.

Conclusion: Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF) provides an effective and robust solution for graph prompt learning by leveraging spiking neuron mechanisms to learn sparse and selective prompts, offering improved compactness and noise robustness over traditional dense prompting approaches.

Abstract: Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) learning has been widely used in adapting pre-trained GNN model on the downstream task. GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF.

*Xiaoyan Sun,Qingyu Meng,Yalu Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces MAFS, a hybrid feature selection framework combining statistical priors with multi-head attention for robust and interpretable ranking in high-dimensional biomedical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature selection is crucial in high-dimensional biomedical data for better prediction, efficiency, and interpretability. Existing methods like filters lack complexity handling, while deep learning lacks stability and interpretability; there's a need to merge statistical interpretability with deep learning power.

Method: MAFS starts with filter-based priors for stable initialization, uses multi-head attention to analyze features from multiple angles capturing nonlinear relationships, and includes a reordering module to consolidate outputs and generate consistent feature rankings.

Result: On simulated and real datasets (e.g., cancer gene expression, Alzheimer's disease), MAFS outperforms existing filter-based and deep learning methods in coverage and stability.

Conclusion: MAFS offers a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data by integrating statistical guidance with deep modeling.

Abstract: Feature selection is essential for high-dimensional biomedical data, enabling stronger predictive performance, reduced computational cost, and improved interpretability in precision medicine applications. Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data.

### [46] [Topology-Independent Robustness of the Weighted Mean under Label Poisoning Attacks in Heterogeneous Decentralized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02682)
*Jie Peng,Weiyu Li,Stefan Vlaski,Qing Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Contrary to expectations, the simple weighted mean aggregator can be more robust to label poisoning in decentralized gradient descent than specialized robust aggregators, particularly in heterogeneous networks with disconnected or sparse topologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness to malicious attacks in decentralized systems is crucial, but existing works often dismiss the weighted mean aggregator as vulnerable while focusing on designing robust aggregators. This paper aims to systematically analyze and compare the robustness of different aggregators.

Method: Theoretical analysis of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, comparing both robust aggregators and the weighted mean aggregator. Empirical validation is used to support the theoretical findings.

Result: The learning errors of robust aggregators depend on network topology, while the weighted mean aggregator's performance is topology-independent. The weighted mean can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, especially when the global contamination rate is lower than the local contamination rate, or when the regular agent network is disconnected or sparse with high local contamination.

Conclusion: Contrary to its perceived vulnerability, the weighted mean aggregator can be more robust than specialized robust aggregators in decentralized gradient descent, especially under sufficient heterogeneity and when the network of regular agents is disconnected or sparse. The paper emphasizes that network topology plays a critical role in determining robustness against label poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Robustness to malicious attacks is crucial for practical decentralized signal processing and machine learning systems. A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks.

### [47] [Scaling Laws of Machine Learning for Optimal Power Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02706)
*Xinyi Liu,Xuan He,Yize Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a systematic scaling study for machine learning-based optimal power flow, analyzing data and compute scaling with power-law relationships to guide ML-OPF design and deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on machine learning approaches for optimal power flow, such as deep neural networks, lack analysis of minimum training data volume and model complexity balancing with real-time computational limits, leading to trial-and-error development in practical applications.

Method: The work conducts a systematic scaling study across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple neural network architectures with varying FLOPs), evaluating DNNs and physics-informed NNs on prediction error, constraint violations, and speed.

Result: The results reveal consistent power-law relationships between resource dimensions and performance metrics, showing that accuracy scales with dataset size and training compute. A divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility is identified, with a compute-optimal frontier characterized.

Conclusion: This study provides quantitative guidance for ML-OPF design and deployments by enabling predictable and principled ML pipeline design based on scaling laws.

Abstract: Optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the fundamental tasks for power system operations. While machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely studied to enhance OPF solution speed and performance, their practical deployment faces two critical scaling questions: What is the minimum training data volume required for reliable results? How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF. We further identify the divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility and characterize the compute-optimal frontier. This work provides quantitative guidance for ML-OPF design and deployments.

*Beicheng Lou,Zifei Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using proper complex linear algebra for RoPE reduces attention block parameters by ~50% with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RoPE implementation fails to fully leverage its complex linear algebra foundation, leading to parameter redundancy in Q/K/V projections.

Method: Replace standard Q/K/V projection with complex linear transformation derived from RoPE formulation.

Result: Complex linear transformation achieves near 50% parameter savings in attention blocks with negligible impact on both in-sample and out-of-sample performance.

Conclusion: Representing positional information via complex linear algebra for attention mechanisms reduces parameter redundancy without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Rotary positional embedding has become the state-of-the-art approach to encode position information in transformer-based models. While it is often succinctly expressed in complex linear algebra, we note that the actual implementation of $Q/K/V$-projections is not equivalent to a complex linear transformation. We argue that complex linear transformation is a more natural parametrization and saves near 50\% parameters within the attention block. We show empirically that removing such redundancy has negligible impact on the model performance both in sample and out of sample. Our modification achieves more efficient parameter usage, as well as a cleaner interpretation of the representation space.

TL;DR: A framework for efficient computation of tree ensemble proximities using separable weighted leaf-collision measures, enabling scalable sparse matrix factorization in Python.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tree ensemble proximity methods suffer from high time or memory complexity, limiting scalability for large datasets.

Method: Define a family of Separable Weighted Leaf-Collision Proximities that admit exact sparse matrix factorization, avoiding pairwise comparisons and using sparse linear algebra for computation.

Result: Empirical benchmarks show significant runtime and memory improvements, allowing scaling to hundreds of thousands of samples on standard CPUs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables efficient and scalable proximity computation for tree ensembles, overcoming previous limitations and facilitating broader application.

Abstract: Tree ensemble methods such as Random Forests naturally induce supervised similarity measures through their decision tree structure, but existing implementations of proximities derived from tree ensembles typically suffer from quadratic time or memory complexity, limiting their scalability. In this work, we introduce a general framework for efficient proximity computation by defining a family of Separable Weighted Leaf-Collision Proximities. We show that any proximity measure in this family admits an exact sparse matrix factorization, restricting computation to leaf-level collisions and avoiding explicit pairwise comparisons. This formulation enables low-memory, scalable proximity computation using sparse linear algebra in Python. Empirical benchmarks demonstrate substantial runtime and memory improvements over traditional approaches, allowing tree ensemble proximities to scale efficiently to datasets with hundreds of thousands of samples on standard CPU hardware.

*Mingming Zhang,Na Li,Zhuang Feiqing,Hongyang Zheng,Jiangbing Zhou,Wang Wuyin,Sheng-jie Sun,XiaoWei Chen,Junxiong Zhu,Lixin Zou,Chenliang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Q-value regularized generative auto-bidding method (QGA) improves ad performance by combining imitation learning with Q-learning and safe exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current auto-bidding methods rely heavily on RL and generative models that imitate offline data, requiring complex tuning and struggling with suboptimal trajectories.

Method: QGA integrates Q-value regularization with double Q-learning into a Decision Transformer backbone, optimizing both policy imitation and action-value maximization. It includes a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism with multiple return-to-go targets and perturbed actions.

Result: QGA outperforms alternatives on benchmarks and simulations, achieving a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI in real-world A/B testing.

Conclusion: QGA effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by blending imitation and reinforcement learning with guided exploration, leading to significant gains in advertising efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.
  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.

*Xiucheng Wang,Peilin Zheng,Honggang Jia,Nan Cheng,Ruijin Sun,Conghao Zhou,Xuemin Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes RadioDiff-Flux, a two-stage latent diffusion framework for fast radio map construction in 6G, reusing precomputed midpoints to reduce inference time by up to 50× with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In 6G scenarios with high-speed entities and fast-changing environments, real-time radio map construction is challenging. Existing diffusion models offer high accuracy but suffer from high inference latency due to iterative denoising, making them impractical for delay-sensitive applications.

Method: Introduces a two-stage latent diffusion framework: first stage generates coarse latent representation from static scene features (cacheable); second stage refines it dynamically with a pre-trained model using transmitter locations and conditions, avoiding redundant early computations.

Result: Experimental results show up to 50× acceleration in inference time with less than 0.15% accuracy loss compared to traditional methods, enabling fast and scalable radio map generation.

Conclusion: RadioDiff-Flux effectively decouples static and dynamic modeling, leveraging cached midpoints to achieve real-time performance for 6G networks while maintaining high fidelity, demonstrating practical utility for adaptive wireless communication.

Abstract: Accurate radio map (RM) construction is essential to enabling environment-aware and adaptive wireless communication. However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation. The proposed RadioDiff-Flux significantly reduces inference time while preserving fidelity. Experiment results show that RadioDiff-Flux can achieve up to 50 acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss, demonstrating its practical utility for fast, scalable RM generation in future 6G networks.

### [52] [Stratified Hazard Sampling: Minimal-Variance Event Scheduling for CTMC/DTMC Discrete Diffusion and Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02799)
*Seunghwan Jang,SooJean Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stratified Hazard Sampling (SHS) is a variance-reducing inference method for discrete generative models like CTMC/DTMC-based models, using cumulative hazard stratification to minimize edit variance while preserving expected jumps and multimodality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard inference in discrete generative models involves step-based simulation with independent Bernoulli/categorical draws, leading to high variance in edit number and timing, causing under-editing or over-editing issues that reduce reproducibility.

Method: SHS models token edits as events driven by cumulative hazard (for CTMC) or cumulative jump mass (for DTMC), stratifies this cumulative quantity with a single random phase per position, and triggers jumps when crossing unit-spaced thresholds to maintain unbiased estimates with minimal variance.

Result: SHS achieves the minimum possible variance among unbiased integer estimators (bounded by 1/4), preserves expected number of jumps without altering destination sampling, retains multimodality, and includes a variant for lexical constraints to handle blacklist-style artifacts.

Conclusion: SHS is an effective, hyperparameter-free drop-in inference principle that improves reproducibility and reduces failure modes in discrete generative model samplers by minimizing edit variance through cumulative hazard stratification.

Abstract: CTMC/DTMC-based discrete generative models, including uniform-noise discrete diffusion (e.g., D3PM/CTDD) and discrete flow matching, enable non-autoregressive sequence generation by repeatedly replacing tokens through a time-inhomogeneous Markov process. Inference is typically implemented with step-based simulation: each token decides to jump via independent Bernoulli (or categorical) draws at every discretization step. Under uniform-noise initialization, where self-correction requires multiple edits per position, these independent decisions induce substantial variance in both the number and timing of edits, leading to characteristic failure modes such as under-editing (residual noise) or over-editing (cascading unnecessary substitutions), decreasing reproducibility.
  We propose Stratified Hazard Sampling (SHS), a drop-in and hyperparameter-free inference principle for any sampler that admits a stay-vs.-replace decomposition. SHS models per-token edits as events driven by cumulative hazard (CTMC) or cumulative jump mass (DTMC) and places events by stratifying this cumulative quantity: with a single random phase per position, a token jumps whenever its accumulated hazard crosses unit-spaced thresholds. This preserves the expected number of jumps while achieving the minimum possible variance among unbiased integer estimators (bounded by 1/4), without altering per-jump destination sampling and thus retaining multimodality. We also introduce a phase-allocation variant for blacklist-style lexical constraints that prioritizes early edits at high-risk positions to mitigate late-masking artifacts.

TL;DR: Hybrid neural network combining linear/nonlinear structures with online learning and forecast combination achieves accurate, computationally efficient electricity price forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate day-ahead electricity price forecasts are crucial for portfolio management, power plant operations, battery storage optimization, and demand response planning, but existing models either fail to capture nonlinear relationships (linear models) or are computationally expensive (nonlinear models).

Method: A novel multivariate neural network that combines linear and nonlinear feed-forward neural structures, integrates online learning and forecast combination, and incorporates fundamental relationships from renewable generation, demand patterns, energy markets, autoregressive dynamics, and calendar effects.

Result: The method significantly reduces computational cost while delivering superior forecasting accuracy (12-13% RMSE and 15-18% MAE reductions compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks) based on a six-year study of major European electricity markets.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid neural network approach effectively balances accuracy and computational efficiency for electricity price forecasting by combining linear/nonlinear structures with comprehensive market factors.

Abstract: Precise day-ahead forecasts for electricity prices are crucial to ensure efficient portfolio management, support strategic decision-making for power plant operations, enable efficient battery storage optimization, and facilitate demand response planning. However, developing an accurate prediction model is highly challenging in an uncertain and volatile market environment. For instance, although linear models generally exhibit competitive performance in predicting electricity prices with minimal computational requirements, they fail to capture relevant nonlinear relationships. Nonlinear models, on the other hand, can improve forecasting accuracy with a surge in computational costs. We propose a novel multivariate neural network approach that combines linear and nonlinear feed-forward neural structures. Unlike previous hybrid models, our approach integrates online learning and forecast combination for efficient training and accuracy improvement. It also incorporates all relevant characteristics, particularly the fundamental relationships arising from wind and solar generation, electricity demand patterns, related energy fuel and carbon markets, in addition to autoregressive dynamics and calendar effects. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark models, the proposed forecasting method significantly reduces computational cost while delivering superior forecasting accuracy (12-13% RMSE and 15-18% MAE reductions). Our results are derived from a six-year forecasting study conducted on major European electricity markets.

TL;DR: QNTK-UCB algorithm improves quantum neural network bandits by using a static kernel from random initialization, reducing parameter scaling from O((TK)^8) to O((TK)^3).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network-based algorithms for stochastic contextual bandits face challenges in scaling to quantum neural networks (QNNs), including over-parameterization, computational instability, and barren plateaus.

Method: The Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) freezes QNN at random initialization and uses its static QNTK for ridge regression to bypass unstable training dynamics.

Result: QNTK-UCB achieves a parameter scaling of Ω((TK)^3), significantly better than Ω((TK)^8) for classical NeuralUCB, with empirical validation on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native tasks showing superior sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The QNTK's inherent properties offer implicit regularization and spectral decay, enabling potential 'quantum advantage' in online learning.

Abstract: Stochastic contextual bandits are fundamental for sequential decision-making but pose significant challenges for existing neural network-based algorithms, particularly when scaling to quantum neural networks (QNNs) due to issues such as massive over-parameterization, computational instability, and the barren plateau phenomenon. This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations.
  By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $Ω((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $Ω((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes. This work highlights how the inherent properties of QNTK provide implicit regularization and a sharper spectral decay, paving the way for achieving ``quantum advantage'' in online learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust regression model for predicting the Stick-Slip Index in drilling that can generalize across domains by handling different wells from training data, enhancing reliability in real-world applications.

Method: Use a grid search to optimize hyperparameters, train on 60-second labeled sequences of 1 Hz surface drilling data, and compare Adversarial Domain Generalization, Invariant Risk Minimization, baseline models, and transfer learning effectiveness.

Result: ADG and IRM models improve performance by 10% and 8% over the baseline, respectively; severe events are detected 60% of the time versus 20% for baseline; ADG slightly outperforms IRM, and transfer learning further boosts performance.

Conclusion: Domain generalization approaches, particularly ADG, are effective for drilling applications, with ADG emerging as the most effective method and transfer learning providing additional improvement, enhancing model robustness across domains.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of domain generalization techniques applied to time series data within a drilling context, focusing on the prediction of a continuous Stick-Slip Index (SSI), a critical metric for assessing torsional downhole vibrations at the drill bit. The study aims to develop a robust regression model that can generalize across domains by training on 60 second labeled sequences of 1 Hz surface drilling data to predict the SSI. The model is tested in wells that are different from those used during training. To fine-tune the model architecture, a grid search approach is employed to optimize key hyperparameters. A comparative analysis of the Adversarial Domain Generalization (ADG), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and baseline models is presented, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of transfer learning (TL) in improving model performance. The ADG and IRM models achieve performance improvements of 10% and 8%, respectively, over the baseline model. Most importantly, severe events are detected 60% of the time, against 20% for the baseline model. Overall, the results indicate that both ADG and IRM models surpass the baseline, with the ADG model exhibiting a slight advantage over the IRM model. Additionally, applying TL to a pre-trained model further improves performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of domain generalization approaches in drilling applications, with ADG emerging as the most effective approach.

TL;DR: A novel 4-bit quantization framework (RPIQ) compresses large models like OPT and CogVLM2, reducing memory by 60-75% while maintaining near-original performance, enhancing deployment for assistive systems for visually impaired users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visually impaired users need intelligent assistive systems with accurate recognition, but large models face deployment challenges due to high memory and inference costs, and existing quantization strategies suffer from inter-block error accumulation and instability.

Method: Proposes RPIQ, a quantization framework using a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization to compress models to 4-bit representation.

Result: RPIQ reduces peak memory consumption by approximately 60%-75% compared to full-precision models, maintains performance close to full-precision on language and visual tasks, and shows excellent recognition in applications like text understanding and visual question answering.

Conclusion: RPIQ effectively enables deployment of large models in real assistive systems, advancing computational efficiency and reliability to provide visually impaired users with accurate and rapid information access.

Abstract: Visually impaired users face significant challenges in daily information access and real-time environmental perception, and there is an urgent need for intelligent assistive systems with accurate recognition capabilities. Although large-scale models provide effective solutions for perception and reasoning, their practical deployment on assistive devices is severely constrained by excessive memory consumption and high inference costs. Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios. While verifying the effectiveness of RPIQ for deployment in real assistive systems, this study also advances the computational efficiency and reliability of large models, enabling them to provide visually impaired users with the required information accurately and rapidly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework using gradient ascent for prompt discovery in LLMs to control behavioral personas like sycophancy and hallucination, offering improved alignment, interpretability, and safety measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling emergent behavioral personas (e.g., sycophancy, hallucination) in LLMs is critical for AI safety, but existing solutions face a dilemma: manual prompt engineering is intuitive but unscalable and imprecise, while automatic optimization methods are effective but lack interpretability as 'black boxes' with no clear connection to model internals.

Method: We propose a novel framework that adapts gradient ascent to LLMs for targeted prompt discovery, specifically introducing two methods: RESGA and SAEGA, which optimize randomly initialized prompts to align representations with identified persona directions. We also introduce fluent gradient ascent to control the fluency of discovered persona steering prompts.

Result: We demonstrate RESGA and SAEGA's effectiveness across Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 3 for steering three personas: sycophancy, hallucination, and myopic reward. Notably, on sycophancy, our automatically discovered prompts achieve significant improvement (e.g., 49.90% compared with 79.24%).

Conclusion: Our framework grounds prompt discovery in mechanistically meaningful features, offering a new paradigm for controllable and interpretable behavior modification in LLMs.

Abstract: Controlling emergent behavioral personas (e.g., sycophancy, hallucination) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI safety, yet remains a persistent challenge. Existing solutions face a dilemma: manual prompt engineering is intuitive but unscalable and imprecise, while automatic optimization methods are effective but operate as "black boxes" with no interpretable connection to model internals. We propose a novel framework that adapts gradient ascent to LLMs, enabling targeted prompt discovery. In specific, we propose two methods, RESGA and SAEGA, that both optimize randomly initialized prompts to achieve better aligned representation with an identified persona direction. We introduce fluent gradient ascent to control the fluency of discovered persona steering prompts. We demonstrate RESGA and SAEGA's effectiveness across Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 3 for steering three different personas,sycophancy, hallucination, and myopic reward. Crucially, on sycophancy, our automatically discovered prompts achieve significant improvement (49.90% compared with 79.24%). By grounding prompt discovery in mechanistically meaningful features, our method offers a new paradigm for controllable and interpretable behavior modification.

TL;DR: ChemBART is a unified large language model pre-trained on chemical reactions to solve multiple tasks in computer-aided synthesis planning, enabling shorter and higher-yield synthesis routes validated in the lab.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM applications in CASP are limited to single tasks like precursor prediction, lacking a unified model for broader chemical challenges in synthesis planning.

Method: Develop ChemBART, a SMILES-based LLM pre-trained via mask-filling on reaction expressions, to handle tasks such as precursor/reagent generation, temperature-yield regression, property classification, and integration with RL and Monte Carlo tree search for multi-step synthesis design.

Result: ChemBART enables shorter multi-step synthesis routes with ~30% improved yield over benchmarks, as confirmed by wet-lab validation, and addresses diverse chemical tasks under one model.

Conclusion: ChemBART demonstrates the effectiveness of reaction-focused pre-training for advancing comprehensive synthesis planning and highlights its utility across the synthesis cycle, validating the 'one model, multiple tasks' paradigm.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across diverse fields. While LLMs have been applied to molecular simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) in computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP), existing methodologies typically address single tasks, such as precursor prediction. We introduce ChemBART, a SMILES-based LLM pre-trained on chemical reactions, which enables a unified model for multiple downstream chemical tasks--achieving the paradigm of "one model, one pre-training, multiple tasks." By leveraging outputs from a mask-filling pre-training task on reaction expressions, ChemBART effectively solves a variety of chemical problems, including precursor/reagent generation, temperature-yield regression, molecular property classification, and optimizing the policy and value functions within a reinforcement learning framework, integrated with Monte Carlo tree search for multi-step synthesis route design. Unlike single-molecule pre-trained LLMs constrained to specific applications, ChemBART addresses broader chemical challenges and integrates them for comprehensive synthesis planning. Crucially, ChemBART-designed multi-step synthesis routes and reaction conditions directly inspired wet-lab validation, which confirmed shorter pathways with ~30% yield improvement over literature benchmarks. Our work validates the power of reaction-focused pre-training and showcases the broad utility of ChemBART in advancing the complete synthesis planning cycle.

TL;DR: LLMs evolved via execution feedback in a closed-loop synthesis framework into autonomous neural design generators, learning architectural priors and producing novel, high-performing networks across fine-tuning cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' underexplored ability to autonomously navigate neural architecture design, balancing syntactic reliability, performance, and structural novelty.

Method: Closed-loop synthesis with 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles involving code generation, validation, single-epoch evaluation, MinHash-Jaccard redundancy filtering, and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning using high-performing architectures as prompt-code pairs.

Result: Valid generation rate stabilized at 50.6% (peak 74.5%). Mean first-epoch accuracy rose from 28.06% to 50.99%. High-performing (>40% accuracy) candidates grew from 2.04% to 96.81%. Model synthesized 455 new high-performing architectures not in the original corpus.


Conclusion: LLMs can internalize empirical, non-textual rewards to evolve into autonomous, performance-driven neural designers, moving beyond copying existing motifs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in program synthesis, yet their ability to autonomously navigate neural architecture design--balancing syntactic reliability, performance, and structural novelty--remains underexplored. We address this by placing a code-oriented LLM within a closed-loop synthesis framework, analyzing its evolution over 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles. The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator. The valid generation rate stabilizes at 50.6 percent (peaking at 74.5 percent), while mean first-epoch accuracy rises from 28.06 percent to 50.99 percent, and the fraction of candidates exceeding 40 percent accuracy grows from 2.04 percent to 96.81 percent. Analyses confirm the model moves beyond replicating existing motifs, synthesizing 455 high-performing architectures absent from the original corpus. By grounding code synthesis in execution feedback, this work provides a scalable blueprint for transforming stochastic generators into autonomous, performance-driven neural designers, establishing that LLMs can internalize empirical, non-textual rewards to transcend their training data.

*Yuqi Yang,Ying Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes max-p aggregation of conformity scores for multi-distribution conformal prediction that guarantees uniform coverage across heterogeneous distributions while optimizing prediction set efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for prediction sets that remain valid across multiple source distributions when test data may come from an arbitrary mixture of them, particularly relevant for fairness, distribution robustness, and multi-source learning problems.

Method: Proposes a max-p aggregation scheme for conformity scores across distributions, proves its optimality for uniform coverage, and develops an algorithm to learn efficient conformity scores that minimize prediction set sizes while maintaining coverage guarantees.

Result: The method ensures finite-sample multi-distribution coverage guarantees, significantly reduces prediction set sizes compared to naive approaches, and achieves comparable efficiency to single-source prediction sets with standard conformity scores across synthetic and real-data experiments.

Conclusion: Our conformal prediction framework with max-p aggregation and learned conformity scores effectively addresses the challenge of maintaining valid coverage across multiple heterogeneous distributions while achieving competitive prediction set sizes compared to single-source methods.

Abstract: In many fairness and distribution robustness problems, one has access to labeled data from multiple source distributions yet the test data may come from an arbitrary member or a mixture of them. We study the problem of constructing a conformal prediction set that is uniformly valid across multiple, heterogeneous distributions, in the sense that no matter which distribution the test point is from, the coverage of the prediction set is guaranteed to exceed a pre-specified level. We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning. In synthetic and real-data experiments, our method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while greatly reducing the set size compared with naively applying max-p aggregation to single-source conformity scores, and can be comparable in size to single-source prediction sets with popular, standard conformity scores.

*Anaïs Berkes,Vincent Taboga,Donna Vakalis,David Rolnick,Yoshua Bengio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPICE introduces a Bayesian ICRL method using deep ensemble priors and UCB-based inference that achieves theoretical regret guarantees and strong empirical performance on unseen tasks, even with suboptimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current in-context reinforcement learning methods either cannot improve beyond their training distribution or require near-optimal data, limiting practical adoption. There is a need for methods that can adapt effectively to unseen environments using only suboptimal offline data.

Method: SPICE uses deep ensemble to learn a prior over Q-values, then performs Bayesian updates using in-context information at test time. Online inference follows an Upper-Confidence Bound rule to encourage exploration and adaptation, enabling recovery from poor priors from suboptimal training data.

Result: Theoretical analysis proves SPICE achieves regret-optimal behavior in both stochastic bandits and finite-horizon MDPs, even when pretrained on suboptimal trajectories. Empirical validation shows SPICE achieves near-optimal decisions on unseen tasks, substantially reduces regret compared to prior ICRL and meta-RL methods, rapidly adapts to unseen tasks, and remains robust under distribution shift.

Conclusion: SPICE successfully addresses the limitations of current ICRL methods by providing a robust Bayesian approach that achieves regret-optimal behavior even with suboptimal training data. It demonstrates practical advantages over prior methods through strong empirical performance and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) promises fast adaptation to unseen environments without parameter updates, but current methods either cannot improve beyond the training distribution or require near-optimal data, limiting practical adoption. We introduce SPICE, a Bayesian ICRL method that learns a prior over Q-values via deep ensemble and updates this prior at test-time using in-context information through Bayesian updates. To recover from poor priors resulting from training on sub-optimal data, our online inference follows an Upper-Confidence Bound rule that favours exploration and adaptation. We prove that SPICE achieves regret-optimal behaviour in both stochastic bandits and finite-horizon MDPs, even when pretrained only on suboptimal trajectories. We validate these findings empirically across bandit and control benchmarks. SPICE achieves near-optimal decisions on unseen tasks, substantially reduces regret compared to prior ICRL and meta-RL approaches while rapidly adapting to unseen tasks and remaining robust under distribution shift.

*Vidhi Rathore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMF, a method merging causal inference and geometric deep learning, makes latent space geometry invariant to sensitive attributes, testing on synthetic data to measure fairness-utility trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fairness methods overlook the causal geometric warping of the data manifold by sensitive attributes like race and gender, focusing on static data.

Method: Introduces Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF) by learning latent representations with invariant local Riemannian geometry (metric tensor, curvature) via constraints on decoder Jacobian and Hessian.

Result: CMF effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, validated on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs).

Conclusion: CMF provides a rigorous framework to quantify and mitigate geometric unfairness, balancing fairness and utility through metric invariance.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is increasingly critical, yet standard approaches often treat data as static points in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying generative structure. We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.

TL;DR: Replication study finds SAE-based mechanistic interpretability promising but fragile and unreliable for safety-critical applications, suggesting a shift toward output-based control rather than internal representation interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To stress-test Anthropic's claims about mechanistic interpretability and evaluate its potential for human oversight in AI safety.

Method: Replication of Anthropic's main results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1, including basic feature extraction and steering capabilities.

Result: Feature steering shows substantial fragility with sensitivity to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context; non-standard activation behavior observed; difficulty in distinguishing thematically similar features; current methods fall short of systematic reliability.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that while SAE-based interpretability creates compelling demonstrations in specific cases, current methods often lack the systematic reliability needed for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Recent work by Anthropic on Mechanistic interpretability claims to understand and control Large Language Models by extracting human-interpretable features from their neural activation patterns using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). If successful, this approach offers one of the most promising routes for human oversight in AI safety. We conduct an initial stress-test of these claims by replicating their main results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1. While we successfully reproduce basic feature extraction and steering capabilities, our investigation suggests that major caution is warranted regarding the generalizability of these claims. We find that feature steering exhibits substantial fragility, with sensitivity to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context. We observe non-standard activation behavior and demonstrate the difficulty to distinguish thematically similar features from one another. While SAE-based interpretability produces compelling demonstrations in selected cases, current methods often fall short of the systematic reliability required for safety-critical applications. This suggests a necessary shift in focus from prioritizing interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output. Our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of what mechanistic interpretability has achieved and highlights fundamental challenges for AI safety that remain unresolved.

TL;DR: Joint encoding of KV-cache blocks across requests to reduce memory bottleneck in LLMs, achieving high compression with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV-cache memory limits LLM throughput under concurrent loads; current compression methods lack scalability or disrupt structure.

Method: Propose joint encoding that fuses similar KV-cache blocks across requests and input chunks while preserving standard cache layout.

Result: Achieves up to 4.38x KV-cache compression, ~40% token throughput improvement in real serving benchmarks with negligible accuracy drop.

Conclusion: Joint encoding effectively alleviates KV-cache bottleneck, enhancing LLM inference throughput without specialized hardware.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) drive interactive AI systems but are bottlenecked by the memory-heavy growth of key-value (KV) caches, which limits real-time throughput under concurrent loads. Existing KV-cache compression methods rely on rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized compute, hindering scalability and deployment.
  We propose joint encoding of KV-cache blocks, which fuses similar blocks across requests and input chunks into shared representations while preserving standard cache structure. This alleviates the KV-cache memory bottleneck, supporting high-concurrency serving without specialized hardware. Theoretically, we analyze the rate-distortion tradeoff of fused cache blocks under a Poisson process model. Empirically, our method achieves up to 4.38 $\times$ KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, outperforming recent structured and adaptive compression baselines. In real LLM serving, joint encoding improves the token throughput by $\sim$40\% on a single-machine vLLM benchmark, demonstrating substantial gains in inference throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods fall short in effectively handling the complexity and dynamism of multi-dimensional data streams in Industrial IoT (IIoT) environments where real-time detection is critical for reliability and service availability.

Method: An adaptive anomaly detection algorithm that merges a multi-source prediction model with a novel drift adaptation method for IIoT streaming data.

Result: The method achieved up to 89.71% accuracy (AUC) in trace-driven evaluations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while meeting efficiency and scalability requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive anomaly detection method using multi-source prediction and concept drift adaptation effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches in handling IIoT streaming data complexity and dynamism.

Abstract: To ensure reliability and service availability, next-generation networks are expected to rely on automated anomaly detection systems powered by advanced machine learning methods with the capability of handling multi-dimensional data. Such multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data occurs mostly in today's industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where real-time detection of anomalies is critical to prevent impending failures and resolve them in a timely manner. However, existing anomaly detection methods often fall short of effectively coping with the complexity and dynamism of multi-dimensional data streams in IIoT. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for detecting anomalies in IIoT streaming data utilizing a multi-source prediction model and concept drift adaptation. The proposed anomaly detection algorithm merges a prediction model into a novel drift adaptation method resulting in accurate and efficient anomaly detection that exhibits improved scalability. Our trace-driven evaluations indicate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods by achieving up to an 89.71% accuracy (in terms of Area under the Curve (AUC)) while meeting the given efficiency and scalability requirements.

### [66] [Prompt-Counterfactual Explanations for Generative AI System Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03156)
*Sofie Goethals,Foster Provost,João Sedoc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI that adapts counterfactual explanations to identify what prompt features cause specific output characteristics (toxicity, bias, sentiment) and enables better prompt engineering and red-teaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative AI systems are integrated into real-world applications, organizations need to understand what causes them to produce outputs with specific characteristics (toxicity, sentiment, bias). Traditional counterfactual explanation methods cannot be directly applied to generative AI due to fundamental differences in how these systems function.

Method: The paper proposes a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic generative AI systems, introducing an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). The approach leverages downstream classifiers to identify key characteristics in AI outputs and systematically searches for minimal prompt modifications that change these characteristics.

Result: The paper demonstrates the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems through three case studies examining political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment. The PCE framework successfully streamlines prompt engineering to suppress undesirable outputs and enhances red-teaming efforts to uncover prompts that elicit problematic responses.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI, which will become essential as models take on higher-stakes tasks and face regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability. The PCE framework enables both mitigation through better prompt engineering and identification of problematic prompts through improved red-teaming.

Abstract: As generative AI systems become integrated into real-world applications, organizations increasingly need to be able to understand and interpret their behavior. In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -- the prompt -- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.

*David Hartmann,Lena Pohlmann,Lelia Hanslik,Noah Gießing,Bettina Berendt,Pieter Delobelle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BAFA is a query-efficient active fairness auditing method for black-box LLMs, reducing query needs significantly compared to stratified sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auditing tools are resource-intensive due to high query access requirements, limiting practicality for black-box LLM fairness assessments.

Method: BAFA frames auditing as uncertainty estimation, uses a version space of surrogate models, active query selection, and constrained empirical risk minimisation to compute fairness metric intervals.

Result: BAFA achieves error thresholds with up to 40x fewer queries than stratified sampling, shows better performance over time, and lower variance in case studies.

Conclusion: Active sampling can significantly cut resource needs, enabling continuous and practical fairness auditing of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic biases across demographic groups. Auditing is proposed as an accountability tool for black-box LLM applications, but suffers from resource-intensive query access. We conceptualise auditing as uncertainty estimation over a target fairness metric and introduce BAFA, the Bounded Active Fairness Auditor for query-efficient auditing of black-box LLMs. BAFA maintains a version space of surrogate models consistent with queried scores and computes uncertainty intervals for fairness metrics (e.g., $Δ$ AUC) via constrained empirical risk minimisation. Active query selection narrows these intervals to reduce estimation error. We evaluate BAFA on two standard fairness dataset case studies: \textsc{CivilComments} and \textsc{Bias-in-Bios}, comparing against stratified sampling, power sampling, and ablations. BAFA achieves target error thresholds with up to 40$\times$ fewer queries than stratified sampling (e.g., 144 vs 5,956 queries at $\varepsilon=0.02$ for \textsc{CivilComments}) for tight thresholds, demonstrates substantially better performance over time, and shows lower variance across runs. These results suggest that active sampling can reduce resources needed for independent fairness auditing with LLMs, supporting continuous model evaluations.

TL;DR: RATS is a high-performance time series augmentation library written in Rust with Python bindings, offering significant speed and memory improvements over existing Python libraries like tsaug.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series augmentation is essential for training robust deep learning models, especially with scarce labeled data. However, existing Python-based augmentation libraries have performance bottlenecks, with running time growing exponentially as dataset sizes increase, limiting their use in large-scale production systems.

Method: We introduce RATS (Rapid Augmentations for Time Series), written in Rust with Python bindings (RATSpy). It implements multiple augmentation methods, including basic transformations, frequency-domain operations, and time warping techniques, accessible through a unified pipeline interface with built-in parallelization.

Result: Benchmarking RATSpy against tsaug on 143 datasets shows that RATSpy achieves an average speedup of 74.5% over tsaug, with up to 94.8% speedup on large datasets, and reduces peak memory usage by up to 47.9%.

Conclusion: RATS provides a high-performance solution for time series augmentation, overcoming the limitations of Python-based libraries, making it suitable for large-scale, production-grade applications, with demonstrated efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Time series augmentation is critical for training robust deep learning models, particularly in domains where labelled data is scarce and expensive to obtain. However, existing augmentation libraries for time series, mainly written in Python, suffer from performance bottlenecks, where running time grows exponentially as dataset sizes increase -- an aspect limiting their applicability in large-scale, production-grade systems. We introduce RATS (Rapid Augmentations for Time Series), a high-performance library for time series augmentation written in Rust with Python bindings (RATSpy). RATS implements multiple augmentation methods spanning basic transformations, frequency-domain operations and time warping techniques, all accessible through a unified pipeline interface with built-in parallelisation. Comprehensive benchmarking of RATSpy versus a commonly used library (tasug) on 143 datasets demonstrates that RATSpy achieves an average speedup of 74.5\% over tsaug (up to 94.8\% on large datasets), with up to 47.9\% less peak memory usage.

*Tuc Nguyen,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATLAS introduces adaptive test-time latent steering to improve LLM reasoning efficiency, using a verifier to dynamically adjust interventions per example and step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the robustness limitations of static steering policies in LLMs, which lead to over- or under-steering across problems.

Method: A lightweight latent verifier predicts reasoning quality from hidden states and adaptively controls steering decisions at inference time.

Result: ATLAS outperforms vanilla decoding and fixed baselines in mathematical reasoning benchmarks, boosting accuracy with reduced token usage.

Conclusion: Verifier-guided latent adaptation provides scalable control of reasoning efficiency without sacrificing quality, with public code release.

Abstract: Recent work on activation and latent steering has demonstrated that modifying internal representations can effectively guide large language models (LLMs) toward improved reasoning and efficiency without additional training. However, most existing approaches rely on fixed steering policies and static intervention strengths, which limit their robustness across problem instances and often result in over- or under-steering. We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task-specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage. These results demonstrate that verifier-guided latent adaptation provides an effective and scalable mechanism for controlling reasoning efficiency without sacrificing solution quality. All source code will be publicly available.

We define the Decentralized Discrete Flow Matching objective, by expressing probability generating velocity as a linear combination of expert flows. We also conduct experiments demonstrating the equivalence between decentralized and centralized training settings for multimodal language models across diverse set of benchmarks.

*Meghna Roy Chowdhury,Shreyas Sen,Yi Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MyoText is a hierarchical framework that translates sEMG signals into text through finger and letter decoding, improving accuracy for wearable text input without keyboards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface electromyography (sEMG) enables direct neural interfaces for muscle activity, offering potential for keyboard-free text input in wearable and mixed-reality systems, but previous methods focused only on direct letter recognition, lacking intermediate physiological grounding.

Method: MyoText uses a hierarchical approach: first, a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG signals; then, ergonomic typing priors are applied to infer letters; finally, a fine-tuned T5 transformer reconstructs full sentences, mimicking the natural typing process to reduce decoding complexity.

Result: On the emg2qwerty dataset with 30 users, MyoText achieved 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER), outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: MyoText provides a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, enhancing feasibility for wearable neural input in virtual and augmented-reality interfaces by integrating ergonomic structure with transformer-based linguistic reasoning.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a direct neural interface for decoding muscle activity and offers a promising foundation for keyboard-free text input in wearable and mixed-reality systems. Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards.

### [72] [Counterfactual Fairness with Graph Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03203)
*Davi Valério,Chrysoula Zerva,Mariana Pinto,Ricardo Santos,André Carreiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CF-GU improves counterfactual fairness audits by incorporating causal graph uncertainty via bootstrapping causal discovery under domain knowledge, providing confidence bounds to better assess ML model bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual fairness audits rely on a single assumed causal graph, which is often uncertain in real-world settings, risking unreliable bias conclusions.

Method: Propose CF-GU: (i) bootstrap causal discovery algorithm under domain knowledge constraints to generate multiple plausible DAGs, (ii) quantify graph uncertainty using normalized Shannon entropy, and (iii) compute confidence bounds on CF metrics.

Result: Synthetic data experiments show how different domain knowledge assumptions affect fairness audits. Real-world data (COMPAS, Adult datasets) reliably identify known biases with high confidence, even with minimal domain knowledge.

Conclusion: CF-GU enhances robustness in ML bias evaluation by accounting for causal graph uncertainty, aiding trustworthy ML systems with more reliable fairness assessments.

Abstract: Evaluating machine learning (ML) model bias is key to building trustworthy and robust ML systems. Counterfactual Fairness (CF) audits allow the measurement of bias of ML models with a causal framework, yet their conclusions rely on a single causal graph that is rarely known with certainty in real-world scenarios. We propose CF with Graph Uncertainty (CF-GU), a bias evaluation procedure that incorporates the uncertainty of specifying a causal graph into CF. CF-GU (i) bootstraps a Causal Discovery algorithm under domain knowledge constraints to produce a bag of plausible Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), (ii) quantifies graph uncertainty with the normalized Shannon entropy, and (iii) provides confidence bounds on CF metrics. Experiments on synthetic data show how contrasting domain knowledge assumptions support or refute audits of CF, while experiments on real-world data (COMPAS and Adult datasets) pinpoint well-known biases with high confidence, even when supplied with minimal domain knowledge constraints.

*Saeyoung Rho,Cyrus Illick,Samhitha Narasipura,Alberto Abadie,Daniel Hsu,Vishal Misra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TASC is a time-aware synthetic control method for causal inference in panel data with trends, using state-space modeling and Kalman filtering to improve accuracy in noisy, trend-heavy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic control methods overlook temporal ordering, failing to leverage data trends, which reduces effectiveness in trend-present scenarios.

Method: TASC uses a state-space model with constant trend, low-rank structure, and applies Kalman filter with expectation-maximization and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother for counterfactual inference.

Result: Evaluation on simulated and real datasets (policy, sports) shows TASC outperforms in settings with strong temporal trends and high observation noise.

Conclusion: TASC effectively incorporates temporal structure to enhance synthetic control methods, offering superior performance for trend-aware causal inference.

Abstract: The synthetic control (SC) framework is widely used for observational causal inference with time-series panel data. SC has been successful in diverse applications, but existing methods typically treat the ordering of pre-intervention time indices interchangeable. This invariance means they may not fully take advantage of temporal structure when strong trends are present. We propose Time-Aware Synthetic Control (TASC), which employs a state-space model with a constant trend while preserving a low-rank structure of the signal. TASC uses the Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother: it first fits a generative time-series model with expectation-maximization and then performs counterfactual inference. We evaluate TASC on both simulated and real-world datasets, including policy evaluation and sports prediction. Our results suggest that TASC offers advantages in settings with strong temporal trends and high levels of observation noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces polymath learning, a one-shot RL framework that uses a single, well-designed training sample to improve LLM reasoning across multiple disciplines, challenging the need for large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs require thousands of high-quality samples; the paper challenges this by exploring whether one-shot learning can be effective in enhancing reasoning abilities.

Method: Proposes polymath learning, which involves designing a single training sample that integrates multidisciplinary elements (e.g., math, physics, chemistry, biology) to elicit broad impact through RL.

Result: Finds that a strategically selected math reasoning sample improves performance across domains, synthetic polymath samples outperform natural individual samples, and the approach exceeds results from larger datasets on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sample quality and design (dubbed sample engineering) are more critical than quantity for unlocking LLM reasoning, suggesting a shift toward precision engineering of training samples over increasing data volume.

Abstract: The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) can be unleashed with reinforcement learning (RL) (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a; Zeng et al., 2025). The success of existing RL attempts in LLMs usually relies on high-quality samples of thousands or beyond. In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models. Our results suggest a shift, dubbed as sample engineering, toward precision engineering of training samples rather than simply increasing data volume.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PersonaLedger is a hybrid generator combining LLM personas and a rule-based engine for creating synthetic, privacy-preserving financial transaction data to advance AI research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strict privacy regulations restrict access to real transaction data, hindering open research; existing synthetic data methods lack both behavioral diversity and logical groundedness.

Method: Uses an LLM conditioned on user personas to generate diverse transaction streams, integrated with a programmable engine enforcing financial rules and updating user states in a closed-loop interaction.

Result: Generated a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users, with a benchmark suite for tasks like illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation.

Conclusion: PersonaLedger provides realistic, privacy-preserving synthetic data to accelerate financial AI innovation and enable rigorous model evaluation without relying on private information.

Abstract: Strict privacy regulations limit access to real transaction data, slowing open research in financial AI. Synthetic data can bridge this gap, but existing generators do not jointly achieve behavioral diversity and logical groundedness. Rule-driven simulators rely on hand-crafted workflows and shallow stochasticity, which miss the richness of human behavior. Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware "nextprompt" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation. PersonaLedger offers a realistic, privacy preserving resource that supports rigorous evaluation of forecasting and anomaly detection models. PersonaLedger offers the community a rich, realistic, and privacy preserving resource -- complete with code, rules, and generation logs -- to accelerate innovation in financial AI and enable rigorous, reproducible evaluation.

### [76] [On the Convergence Behavior of Preconditioned Gradient Descent Toward the Rich Learning Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03162)
*Shuai Jiang,Alexey Voronin,Eric Cyr,Ben Southworth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PGD) methods, like Gauss-Newton, affect spectral bias (neural networks' tendency to learn low frequencies first) and the grokking phenomenon (delayed generalization). It shows theoretically and empirically that PGD mitigates spectral bias issues and reduces grokking delays, suggesting grokking is a transition between lazy (NTK) and rich learning regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral bias helps neural networks generalize by suppressing high-frequency noise but can hinder capturing fine-scale structures in scientific tasks. Grokking, a delayed generalization phenomenon, is hypothesized to arise from a transition between NTK (lazy) and feature-rich regimes. The paper aims to explore how PGD methods impact these issues to improve understanding and optimization of neural network learning.

Method: The paper uses preconditioned gradient descent (PGD), such as Gauss-Newton, as the key optimization technique. It provides theoretical analysis and empirical experiments to study the effects of PGD on spectral bias and grokking. The approach involves comparing PGD with standard methods to demonstrate mitigated spectral bias and reduced grokking delays.

Result: PGD is shown to mitigate issues associated with spectral bias, enabling more uniform exploration of the parameter space in the NTK regime. Experimental results confirm that PGD reduces delays in grokking, providing evidence that grokking represents a transitional behavior between the lazy regime (characterized by NTK) and the rich regime.

Conclusion: PGD methods like Gauss-Newton can effectively address spectral bias and reduce grokking delays in neural networks. The findings support the hypothesis that grokking is a transitional phase between lazy and rich learning regimes, deepening understanding of optimization dynamics, spectral bias, and learning phases in neural networks.

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low frequencies first, can be both a blessing and a curse. While it enhances the generalization capabilities by suppressing high-frequency noise, it can be a limitation in scientific tasks that require capturing fine-scale structures. The delayed generalization phenomenon known as grokking is another barrier to rapid training of neural networks. Grokking has been hypothesized to arise as learning transitions from the NTK to the feature-rich regime. This paper explores the impact of preconditioned gradient descent (PGD), such as Gauss-Newton, on spectral bias and grokking phenomena. We demonstrate through theoretical and empirical results how PGD can mitigate issues associated with spectral bias. Additionally, building on the rich learning regime grokking hypothesis, we study how PGD can be used to reduce delays associated with grokking. Our conjecture is that PGD, without the impediment of spectral bias, enables uniform exploration of the parameter space in the NTK regime. Our experimental results confirm this prediction, providing strong evidence that grokking represents a transitional behavior between the lazy regime characterized by the NTK and the rich regime. These findings deepen our understanding of the interplay between optimization dynamics, spectral bias, and the phases of neural network learning.

### [77] [Dynamic Hyperparameter Importance for Efficient Multi-Objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03166)
*Daphne Theodorakopoulos,Marcel Wever,Marius Lindauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes dynamic hyperparameter prioritization in multi-objective ML optimization, using HyperSHAP to focus on important parameters based on objective trade-offs, improving convergence and solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MOO methods treat all hyperparameters equally, neglecting that hyperparameter importance varies significantly with objective trade-offs. A dynamic approach is needed to accelerate convergence and find better Pareto solutions.

Method: The method integrates HyperSHAP-based hyperparameter importance calculation into ParEGO optimization, dynamically adapting the configuration space by fixing unimportant hyperparameters to focus search on influential ones.

Result: Empirical validation across PyMOO and YAHPO-Gym tasks shows improved convergence speed and Pareto front quality compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The dynamic hyperparameter prioritization approach effectively accelerates multi-objective optimization convergence and produces superior solution quality compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Choosing a suitable ML model is a complex task that can depend on several objectives, e.g., accuracy, model size, fairness, inference time, or energy consumption. In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, existing MOO methods typically treat all hyperparameters as equally important, overlooking that hyperparameter importance (HPI) can vary significantly depending on the trade-off between objectives. We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization. For this, we leverage the objective weightings naturally produced by the MOO algorithm ParEGO and adapt the configuration space by fixing the unimportant hyperparameters, allowing the search to focus on the important ones. Eventually, we validate our method with diverse tasks from PyMOO and YAHPO-Gym. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in convergence speed and Pareto front quality compared to baselines.

### [78] [Predicting Time Pressure of Powered Two-Wheeler Riders for Proactive Safety Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03173)
*Sumit S. Shevtekar,Chandresh K. Maurya,Gourab Sil,Subasish Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a large-scale dataset and a deep learning model (MotoTimePressure) to predict time pressure in powered two-wheeler riders, showing its impact on risky behaviors and its utility for collision prediction and ITS interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time pressure affects crash risk for riders, but its prediction is underexplored in intelligent transportation systems, necessitating data-driven methods to enable proactive safety measures.

Method: The study collects over 129,000 labeled multivariate time-series sequences from 153 rides under different time pressure conditions. It proposes MotoTimePressure, a model with convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration, benchmarked against eight baselines.

Result: High Time Pressure leads to 48% higher speeds, 36.4% greater speed variability, 58% more risky turns, 36% more sudden braking, and 50% higher rear brake forces. MotoTimePressure achieves 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, and using its predictions improves collision risk accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%.

Conclusion: Time pressure can be effectively predicted using the proposed dataset and model, enabling ITS interventions like adaptive alerts and speed guidance to enhance two-wheeler safety under the Safe System Approach.

Abstract: Time pressure critically influences risky maneuvers and crash proneness among powered two-wheeler riders, yet its prediction remains underexplored in intelligent transportation systems. We present a large-scale dataset of 129,000+ labeled multivariate time-series sequences from 153 rides by 51 participants under No, Low, and High Time Pressure conditions. Each sequence captures 63 features spanning vehicle kinematics, control inputs, behavioral violations, and environmental context. Our empirical analysis shows High Time Pressure induces 48% higher speeds, 36.4% greater speed variability, 58% more risky turns at intersections, 36% more sudden braking, and 50% higher rear brake forces versus No Time Pressure. To benchmark this dataset, we propose MotoTimePressure, a deep learning model combining convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration, achieving 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, outperforming eight baselines. Since time pressure cannot be directly measured in real time, we demonstrate its utility in collision prediction and threshold determination. Using MTPS-predicted time pressure as features, improves Informer-based collision risk accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%, approaching oracle performance (93.72%). Thresholded time pressure states capture rider cognitive stress and enable proactive ITS interventions, including adaptive alerts, haptic feedback, V2I signaling, and speed guidance, supporting safer two-wheeler mobility under the Safe System Approach.

### [79] [Sparse Knowledge Distillation: A Mathematical Framework for Probability-Domain Temperature Scaling and Multi-Stage Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03195)
*Aaron R. Flouro,Shawn P. Chadwick*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework for sparse knowledge distillation using probability-domain softening operators, offering analytical insights into why sparse models can outperform dense ones, multi-stage pruning effectiveness, convergence guarantees, and operator equivalence classes, with applications to black-box distillation and privacy-aware compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for sparse knowledge distillation, addressing the lack of analytical understanding on why sparse student models can sometimes surpass dense teachers and the effectiveness of iterative pruning versus one-shot methods in model compression.

Method: The paper builds a unified operator-level analytical framework based on probability-domain softening operators, including bias-variance decompositions, homotopy path formalization for multi-stage pruning, convergence analysis, and equivalence class characterizations, grounded in an axiomatic definition of softening operators (ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, etc.).

Result: Derives operator-agnostic bias-variance decompositions explaining when sparse students outperform dense teachers; develops a homotopy path formalization to mathematically justify iterative pruning's success over one-shot pruning; establishes O(1/n) convergence rates for n-stage distillation; identifies equivalence classes of probability-domain operators yielding identical models under capacity constraints; shows theoretical guarantees hold uniformly across operator families satisfying the axioms.

Conclusion: The framework provides a solid theoretical grounding for sparse knowledge distillation, applicable to various practical scenarios like black-box teacher models, partial-access settings (e.g., top-k outputs), and privacy-preserving model compression, by unifying analytical insights and establishing robust guarantees independent of operator implementation details.

Abstract: We develop a unified theoretical framework for sparse knowledge distillation based on probability-domain softening operators. While the equivalence $p^{1/T} \propto \mathrm{softmax}(z/T)$ is well known, our contribution is an operator-level analytical framework built on this foundation rather than the equivalence itself.
  The framework comprises four core components: (i) operator-agnostic bias--variance decompositions that characterize when sparse students outperform dense teachers, (ii) a homotopy path formalization of multi-stage pruning in function space explaining why iterative compression succeeds where one-shot pruning fails, (iii) convergence guarantees establishing $O(1/n)$ rates for $n$-stage distillation with explicit parameter dependence, and (iv) equivalence class characterizations identifying distinct probability-domain operators that yield identical student models under capacity constraints.
  We introduce an axiomatic definition of probability-domain softening operators based on ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, identity, and boundary behavior, and show that multiple non-equivalent operator families satisfy these axioms. All learning-theoretic guarantees are shown to hold uniformly across this operator class, independent of implementation details. These results provide theoretical grounding for black-box teacher distillation, partial-access settings such as top-$k$ truncation and text-only outputs, and privacy-preserving model compression.

*Weilei He,Feng Ju,Zhiyuan Fan,Rui Min,Minhao Cheng,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces VC-IFEval, a new benchmark and dataset for evaluating and improving vision-dependent instruction-following in multimodal large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating instruction-following in multimodal large language models focus too narrowly on textual instructions, overlooking the rich semantic and implicit constraints in visual inputs, which hinders a thorough assessment of these models' capabilities.

Method: The approach involves constructing a systematic dataset with embedded visual constraints and using it for both evaluation and fine-tuning of multimodal large language models.

Result: VC-IFEval enables a more rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of MLLMs, and fine-tuning models on this dataset leads to substantial improvements in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence, as validated through extensive testing on representative models.

Conclusion: The research contributes a new benchmark and dataset, VC-IFEval, that significantly advances the ability to rigorously assess and improve vision-dependent instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs, while highlighting their strengths and limitations.

Abstract: Evaluating the instruction-following (IF) capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for rigorously assessing how faithfully model outputs adhere to user-specified intentions. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs' instruction-following capability primarily focus on verbal instructions in the textual modality. These limitations hinder a thorough analysis of instruction-following capabilities, as they overlook the implicit constraints embedded in the semantically rich visual modality. To address this gap, we introduce VC-IFEval, a new benchmark accompanied by a systematically constructed dataset that evaluates MLLMs' instruction-following ability under multimodal settings. Our benchmark systematically incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design, enabling a more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of how well MLLMs align their outputs with both visual input and textual instructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning MLLMs on our dataset, we achieve substantial gains in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence. Through extensive evaluation across representative MLLMs, we provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of current models.

TL;DR: A new RL framework for machine unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models, using per-step critics and noisy-step rewards to improve concept removal while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods use supervised weight edits or global penalties; RL approaches optimize sparse rewards, leading to high-variance updates and weak credit assignment.

Method: Treat denoising as a sequential decision process, introduce a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards trained on CLIP-based reward predictor, compute advantages for policy-gradient updates of reverse diffusion kernel.

Result: Achieves better or comparable forgetting to baselines across multiple concepts while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show per-step critics and noisy-conditioned rewards are key.

Conclusion: The RL framework is simple, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones; code and evaluation scripts are released for reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Machine unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models aims to remove targeted concepts while preserving overall utility. Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness. We release code and evaluation scripts to facilitate reproducibility and future research on RL-based diffusion unlearning.

### [82] [From Entropy to Epiplexity: Rethinking Information for Computationally Bounded Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03220)
*Marc Finzi,Shikai Qiu,Yiding Jiang,Pavel Izmailov,J. Zico Kolter,Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces epiplexity, a measure of learnable information for computationally bounded observers, challenging classical information theory paradigms by showing how computation can increase information, order matters, and likelihood modeling can exceed data complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical information theory (Shannon information, Kolmogorov complexity) falls short in practical learning by assuming unlimited computational capacity and ignoring useful content. This work addresses paradoxes where deterministic transformations, data order, and distribution matching seem non-informative, but modern AI practice contradicts this.

Method: The authors formalize epiplexity to quantify structural learnable content while excluding time-bounded entropy (randomness). They provide theoretical analysis and practical estimation procedures, demonstrating through examples and dataset experiments.

Result: Epiplexity shows information can be created via computation, depends on data ordering, and enables likelihood modeling to produce programs more complex than the data-generating process. Practical estimates capture data source differences, track downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions for OOD generalization.

Conclusion: Epiplexity offers a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems, contrasting with model selection principles and providing a solution to the paradoxes in information theory.

Abstract: Can we learn more from data than existed in the generating process itself? Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems.

TL;DR: PET-TURTLE通过引入幂律先验和稀疏logit，改进了TURTLE深度聚类算法，使其能够有效处理不平衡数据分布，提高聚类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前先进的深度聚类算法TURTLE假设数据簇是平衡的，当数据不平衡时，该算法会产生非理想的超平面，导致更高的聚类错误。因此需要一种能够处理不平衡数据分布的方法。

Method: 1）扩展TURTLE的代价函数，引入幂律先验来处理不平衡数据分布；2）在标记过程中引入稀疏logit，简化搜索空间。通过交替更新标签和超平面来实现聚类。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据上的实验表明，PET-TURTLE提高了不平衡数据源的聚类准确率，防止了对少数类簇的过度预测，并整体提升了聚类性能。

Conclusion: 我们提出的PET-TURTLE方法通过引入幂律先验解决不平衡数据分布问题，并通过稀疏logit简化搜索空间。实验表明，该方法在不平衡数据上提高了聚类精度，防止了对少数类簇的过度预测，同时也提升了平衡数据集的聚类效果。

Abstract: Foundation vision, audio, and language models enable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks via their latent representations. Recently, unsupervised learning of data group structure with deep learning methods has gained popularity. TURTLE, a state of the art deep clustering algorithm, uncovers data labeling without supervision by alternating label and hyperplane updates, maximizing the hyperplane margin, in a similar fashion to support vector machines (SVMs). However, TURTLE assumes clusters are balanced; when data is imbalanced, it yields non-ideal hyperplanes that cause higher clustering error. We propose PET-TURTLE, which generalizes the cost function to handle imbalanced data distributions by a power law prior. Additionally, by introducing sparse logits in the labeling process, PET-TURTLE optimizes a simpler search space that in turn improves accuracy for balanced datasets. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that PET-TURTLE improves accuracy for imbalanced sources, prevents over-prediction of minority clusters, and enhances overall clustering.

### [84] [Stigmergic Swarming Agents for Fast Subgraph Isomorphism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02449)
*H. Van Dyke Parunak*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ASSIST (Approximate Swarming Subgraph Isomorphism through Stigmergy) is an ACO-inspired heuristic for graph comparison, achieving O(q·log(d)) peering and linear search time, improving efficiency over current O(d^2) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of maximum partial subgraph isomorphism is NP-complete, with naive exponential solutions in q + d and the fastest current heuristic having complexity O(d^2). There is a need for faster, scalable methods to handle large-scale graph comparisons efficiently.

Method: ASSIST is inspired by ant colony optimization (ACO) for the traveling salesperson problem. It involves a peering phase to identify matching nodes in time O(q·log(d)), followed by an iterative subgraph search using swarming and stigmergy principles, with time linear in query size and constant in data size.

Result: ASSIST reduces the time for the combinatorially complex subgraph search to linear in query size and constant in data size. It extends to handle matching problems like temporally ordered edges, inexact matches, and missing nodes or edges, which challenge other heuristics.

Conclusion: ASSIST is a novel heuristic for approximate maximum partial subgraph isomorphism, offering high efficiency with linear query complexity and constant data complexity, and demonstrating adaptability to various matching problems.

Abstract: Maximum partial subgraph isomorphism compares two graphs (nodes joined by edges) to find a largest common subgraph. A common use case, for graphs with labeled nodes, seeks to find instances of a \textit{query} graph with $q$ nodes in a (typically larger) \textit{data} graph with $d$ nodes. The problem is NP-complete, and naïve solutions are exponential in $q + d$. The fastest current heuristic has complexity $O(d^2)$. This paper outlines ASSIST (Approximate Swarming Subgraph Isomorphism through Stigmergy), inspired by the ant colony optimization approach to the traveling salesperson. After peering (identifying matching individual nodes in query and data) in time $O(q\cdot log(d))$, the time required for ASSIST's iterative subgraph search, the combinatorially complex part of the problem, is linear in query size and constant in data size. ASSIST can be extended to support matching problems (such as temporally ordered edges, inexact matches, and missing nodes or edges in the data graph) that frustrate other heuristics.

*Péter Molnár*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A social force-based pedestrian model shows how simple individual rules create complex crowd patterns, with building geometry significantly impacting flow efficiency. The approach includes optimization algorithms and decision-making models for infrastructure design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to: (1) develop a realistic pedestrian flow model for designing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and (2) verify social science theories using a model with sufficient data. The goal is to understand how simple individual behaviors lead to complex collective patterns and how architectural geometry influences pedestrian dynamics.

Method: The study employs a social force theory-based microscopic model featuring an evolutionary algorithm for layout optimization. It integrates decision-making models for alternative goal selection, adaptation/learning capabilities based on accumulated experience, and methods for determining path load distributions considering subjective criteria. The approach also includes a self-organization model for minimal-detour path systems inspired by natural transport networks.

Result: The investigation shows that despite simple individual behavior patterns (moving toward goals at certain speeds while maintaining distances), complex spatial and temporal structures emerge through interactions. Self-organized collective behavior manifests as trails formed by unidirectional movement. Strong dependencies exist between flow properties and building geometries, with geometric changes significantly affecting performance characteristics. Efficiency can be increased by reducing walkable areas, and the evolutionary algorithm successfully optimizes building layouts. The integrated models effectively describe decision-making and adaptive behaviors.

Conclusion: This work successfully develops a comprehensive microscopic pedestrian flow model based on social force theory that captures both individual decision-making and emergent collective behaviors. The model serves as an effective tool for infrastructure design optimization while validating social science theories through data-driven analysis. Key findings include the emergence of complex spatial patterns from simple rules, the significant impact of geometric layouts on flow properties, and the potential for efficiency improvements through strategic design modifications.

Abstract: This work presents a microscopic model to describe pedestrian flows based on the social force theory. The aim of this study is twofold: (1) developing a realistic model that can be used as a tool for designing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and (2) verifying a social science theory using a model with sufficient data. The investigation of the pedestrian model shows that despite simple individual behavior patterns, complex spatial and temporal structures emerge through the interactions in pedestrian flows. Collective behavior emerges from individuals following two basic rules: (1) moving directly towards their goal at a certain speed, and (2) maintaining a distance to other pedestrians and obstacles. This self-organized collective behavior manifests itself as trails that are formed by pedestrians moving in one direction. Furthermore, strong dependencies of the properties of pedestrian flows on geometric forms of buildings are shown, and the influence of geometric changes on performance characteristics is investigated. An example demonstrates how efficiency can be increased by reducing walkable areas. This work also presents an evolutionary algorithm for optimizing building layouts based on the social force model. Additionally, a decision-making model is integrated to describe alternative goal selection, and adaptation and learning capabilities are included to improve pedestrian avoidance behavior and decision strategies based on accumulated experience. A method for determining load distributions in individual sections of a path system considering subjective selection criteria is also developed. Finally, a model that describes the self-organization of path systems with minimal detours is presented, similar to natural transport networks where total length and material costs are optimized.
