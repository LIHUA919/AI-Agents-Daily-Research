In this work, we show that, when executed\nback-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is\nmathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical\nclosest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the\nlayer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical\nargument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation\nstep gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error\nupper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken\ntogether, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the\ndoor to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design\nof future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPTQ, a method for quantizing LLM weights, is mathematically equivalent to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for lattice CVP, providing geometric insights and error bounds.", "motivation": "To clarify the theoretical foundations of GPTQ and connect it to established lattice algorithms for better quantization methods.", "method": "Mathematical equivalence between GPTQ and Babai's algorithm for CVP, analyzed under the Hessian matrix of layer inputs.", "result": "GPTQ's error propagation gains a geometric interpretation and inherits Babai's error upper bound under no-clipping.", "conclusion": "GPTQ is theoretically grounded, enabling future advancements in quantization by leveraging lattice algorithm progress."}}
