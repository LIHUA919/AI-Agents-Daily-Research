Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions.

To mitigate these limitations, existing\napproaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to\nalleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both\nchallenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a\ncomplex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed\nsynchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance\nunder varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to\ndynamically adjust these parameters. Unfortunately, existing works rely on\nstatic heuristic strategies due to the lack of theoretical guidance, which\nprevents them from achieving this goal.

Existing GCIL methods\nprimarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed\nto belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their\napplicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge\nduring inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a\nmore challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two\nintertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs\nthe detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which\ndestabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,\na novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding\ngeneration to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust\ndetection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional\nvariational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old\nclasses, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle\nunknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate\nout-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node\nembeddings.
