Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions.

This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term\nInterval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential\nrelationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals\nwithout resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we\nintroduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic\nconsistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the\ndifferential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit\nof our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This\nestablishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning\naverage velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is\nsignificantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations,\nresulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware\ncompatibility. One-step and two-step SplitMeanFlow models have been\nsuccessfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products (such as\nDoubao), achieving speedups of 20x."}

To mitigate these limitations, existing\napproaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to\nalleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both\nchallenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a\ncomplex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed\nsynchronization steps), and model convergence rate.

The vast, fragmented, and\ncomplex nature of Earth system data, coupled with increasingly sophisticated\nanalytical demands, creates a significant bottleneck for rapid scientific\ndiscovery. Here we introduce EarthLink, the first AI agent designed as an\ninteractive copilot for Earth scientists. It automates the end-to-end research\nworkflow, from planning and code generation to multi-scenario analysis. Unlike\nstatic diagnostic tools, EarthLink can learn from user interaction,\ncontinuously refining its capabilities through a dynamic feedback loop. We\nvalidated its performance on a number of core scientific tasks of climate\nchange, ranging from model-observation comparisons to the diagnosis of complex\nphenomena. In a multi-expert evaluation, EarthLink produced scientifically\nsound analyses and demonstrated an analytical competency that was rated as\ncomparable to specific aspects of a human junior researcher's workflow.\nAdditionally, its transparent, auditable workflows and natural language\ninterface empower scientists to shift from laborious manual execution to\nstrategic oversight and hypothesis generation. EarthLink marks a pivotal step\ntowards an efficient, trustworthy, and collaborative paradigm for Earth system\nresearch in an era of accelerating global change."}

Existing GCIL methods\nprimarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed\nto belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their\napplicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge\nduring inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a\nmore challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two\nintertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs\nthe detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which\ndestabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,\na novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding\ngeneration to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust\ndetection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional\nvariational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old\nclasses, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle\nunknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate\nout-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node\nembeddings.
