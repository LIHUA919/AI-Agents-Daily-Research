However, most existing research still\nstruggles to address the challenges posed by environments where multiple\nvehicles have to interact seamlessly. This study aims to integrate causal\nlearning with reinforcement learning-based methods by leveraging causal\ndisentanglement representation learning (CDRL) to identify and extract causal\nfeatures that influence optimal decision-making in autonomous vehicles. These\nfeatures are then incorporated into graph neural network-based reinforcement\nlearning algorithms to enhance decision-making in complex traffic scenarios. By\nusing causal features as inputs, the proposed approach enables the optimization\nof vehicle behavior at an unsignalized intersection. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed method achieves the highest average reward during\ntraining and our approach significantly outperforms other learning-based\nmethods in several key metrics such as collision rate and average cumulative\nreward during testing. This study provides a promising direction for advancing\nmulti-agent autonomous driving systems and make autonomous vehicles' navigation\nsafer and more efficient in complex traffic environments."}

(1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization\nfor hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy\ndegradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform\nquantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like\ndistributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform\nnature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring\ndequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during\ninference.

Our approach decomposes\ndemonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components\nthrough a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious\ndependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise\nselection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.\nImportantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be\nintegrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any\nadditional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains\ndemonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the\nimportance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient\nLLM agents."}

However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of\ndistributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead\ndramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust\nevaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations\ncan reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting\ncollaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an\nautonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic\nchain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish\nand maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in\nautonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose\nagentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations\nof collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle\nperiods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In\naddition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator\nresources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task\nrequirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust\nsemantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of\ncollaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on\ntrust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust\naccuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be\nchained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient\ncoordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation."}

In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve\ninformation from its equipped memory module to help the person recall\nincomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the\nacquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in\npractice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be\nproactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose\na novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent\nto transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed\nstrategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key\nchallenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse\nforgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to\nobtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only\nabstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,\nwe propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map\nto classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen\nrecall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a\nhierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to\noptimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses.

This\nstudy reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an\nenergy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the\nsmallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts\nfrom a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable\ngating network to retain only active components while estimating their\nconcentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent\nsources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count\nwithin 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near\nexact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity\nor nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to\nother instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By\nuniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR\noffers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including\nchemical library-driven scenarios.

Specifically,\ncoordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication\n(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)\napproaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the\napplicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the\ncombination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,\nwe propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent\nhierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and\nrely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among\nagents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper\nlevels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To\nlearn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment\nmethod based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage\nfunction associated with the upper levels.

However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the\nquadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the\nsequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and\nsimilar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of\nsoftmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from\nthe original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream\naccuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and\nkey inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other\nnonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains\nunanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of\nsoftmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using\nthis form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows\nfor the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the\nimportance of each part and how they interact.

AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and\ntime when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data\nneeded.

The RS ranks the available\nannotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using\ntheir past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as\ninformation about the instance queried.
