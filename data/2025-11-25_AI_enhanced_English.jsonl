These approaches, including structured workflows, debate models, and iterative voting, often lead to communication bottlenecks, stringent decision-making processes, and delayed responses in solving complex and evolving tasks. This article introduces a three-tier architecture, the Hierarchical Adaptive Consensus Network (\\hacn), which suggests various consensus policies based on task characterization and agent performance metrics. The first layer collects the confidence-based voting outcomes of several local agent clusters. In contrast, the second level facilitates inter-cluster communication through cross-clustered partial knowledge sharing and dynamic timeouts. The third layer provides system-wide coordination and final arbitration by employing a global orchestration framework with adaptable decision rules. The proposed model achieves $\\bigO(n)$ communication complexity, as opposed to the $\\bigO(n^2)$ complexity of the existing fully connected MAS. Experiments performed in a simulated environment yielded a 99.9\\% reduction in communication overhead during consensus convergence. Furthermore, the proposed approach ensures consensus convergence through hierarchical escalation and dynamic adaptation for a wide variety of complicated tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "HACN is a three-tier hierarchical architecture for multi-agent systems that reduces communication complexity from O(n\u00b2) to O(n) while achieving 99.9% less communication overhead and ensuring consensus convergence through adaptive policies.", "motivation": "Existing consensus strategies in multi-agent systems face challenges with adaptability, scalability, and convergence, leading to communication bottlenecks, rigid decision-making, and slow responses in complex tasks.", "method": "Three-layer architecture: 1) Local agent clusters perform confidence-based voting, 2) Inter-cluster communication with partial knowledge sharing and dynamic timeouts, 3) Global orchestration with adaptable decision rules for final arbitration.", "result": "Achieved O(n) communication complexity vs O(n\u00b2) in existing systems, 99.9% reduction in communication overhead during consensus convergence, and reliable consensus convergence across complex tasks.", "conclusion": "HACN provides a scalable, adaptive consensus framework that significantly reduces communication overhead while ensuring reliable convergence in multi-agent systems through hierarchical coordination and dynamic policy adaptation."}}
