### [1] [Bidirectional RAG: Safe Self-Improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation Through Multi-Stage Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22199)
*Teja Chinthala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bidirectional RAG enables safe expansion of knowledge bases in RAG systems by validating and writing back high-quality generated responses, nearly doubling coverage compared to standard RAG while adding fewer documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RAG systems rely on static knowledge corpora that cannot evolve from user interactions, limiting their ability to accumulate knowledge over time and improve performance.

Method: Introduced a Bidirectional RAG architecture with a multi-stage acceptance layer for validation, including grounding verification (NLI-based entailment, attribution checking, and novelty detection) to ensure safe corpus expansion and prevent hallucination pollution.

Result: Across four datasets with rigorous testing, Bidirectional RAG achieves 40.58% average coverage, nearly doubling Standard RAG's 20.33%, while adding 72% fewer documents than naive write back approaches.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that self-improving RAG systems are feasible and safe with rigorous validation, providing a practical path for RAG systems to learn from deployment and accumulate knowledge effectively.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG systems enhance large language models by grounding responses in external knowledge bases, but conventional RAG architectures operate with static corpora that cannot evolve from user interactions. We introduce Bidirectional RAG, a novel RAG architecture that enables safe corpus expansion through validated write back of high quality generated responses. Our system employs a multi stage acceptance layer combining grounding verification (NLI based entailment, attribution checking, and novelty detection to prevent hallucination pollution while enabling knowledge accumulation. Across four datasets Natural Questions, TriviaQA, HotpotQA, Stack Overflow with three random seeds 12 experiments per system, Bidirectional RAG achieves 40.58% average coverage nearly doubling Standard RAG 20.33% while adding 72% fewer documents than naive write back 140 vs 500. Our work demonstrates that self improving RAG is feasible and safe when governed by rigorous validation, offering a practical path toward RAG systems that learn from deployment.

### [2] [Emergent Persuasion: Will LLMs Persuade Without Being Prompted?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22201)
*Vincent Chang,Thee Ho,Sunishchal Dev,Kevin Zhu,Shi Feng,Kellin Pelrine,Matthew Kowal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates when large language models (LLMs) may persuade users unprompted, focusing on scenarios of internal activation steering or supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to exhibit certain traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With conversational AI's growing influence on human beliefs, prior research examined persuasion via misuse (explicit harmful prompts). This work addresses the risk of models persuading without explicit prompting, to better understand emergent persuasion risks.

Method: Study of unprompted persuasion in two scenarios: (i) steering models via internal activation manipulation along persona traits, (ii) fine-tuning models with SFT to exhibit similar traits. Both related and unrelated persuasion traits are tested for effects.

Result: Steering toward traits (persuasive or unrelated) does not reliably increase unprompted persuasion, but SFT does. Even SFT on benign persuasion topics yields models more persuasive on controversial or harmful topics, indicating emergent harmful persuasion risks.

Conclusion: Emergent harmful persuasion from AI can arise, particularly through supervised fine-tuning, highlighting the need for further study on these risks to ensure safe and ethical AI deployment.

Abstract: With the wide-scale adoption of conversational AI systems, AI are now able to exert unprecedented influence on human opinion and beliefs. Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further.

### [3] [GamiBench: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning and 2D-to-3D Planning Capabilities of MLLMs with Origami Folding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22207)
*Ryan Spencer,Roey Yaari,Ritvik Vemavarapu,Joyce Yang,Steven Ngo,Utkarsh Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GamiBench, a benchmark to evaluate spatial reasoning via origami tasks, identifying limitations in top MLLMs like GPT-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack spatial reasoning skills (mentally manipulating objects over views/time), with existing benchmarks focusing on static images, failing to capture sequential and viewpoint aspects.

Method: GamiBench uses 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with 3D shapes from six viewpoints, through tasks predicting folds, discerning viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns.

Result: Even leading models (GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro) show difficulty in single-step spatial understanding, demonstrating the benchmark's effectiveness through diagnostic metrics like VC and IFSR.

Conclusion: GamiBench establishes a framework for evaluating geometric and spatial reasoning in MLLMs, highlighting a critical gap and offering code/dataset for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proficient in perception and instruction-following, but they still struggle with spatial reasoning: the ability to mentally track and manipulate objects across multiple views and over time. Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding. These contributions establish a standardized framework for evaluating geometric understanding and spatial reasoning in MLLMs. Dataset and code: https://github.com/stvngo/GamiBench.

### [4] [Toward Equitable Recovery: A Fairness-Aware AI Framework for Prioritizing Post-Flood Aid in Bangladesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22210)
*Farjana Yesmin,Romana Akter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fairness-aware AI framework using adversarial debiasing reduces biases in post-flood aid allocation in Bangladesh by learning bias-invariant representations, improving fairness metrics while maintaining high predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-disaster aid allocation in developing nations often has systematic biases against vulnerable regions, perpetuating historical inequities; this paper addresses this by applying fairness-aware AI techniques to ensure more equitable aid distribution in Bangladesh.

Method: An adversarial debiasing model is developed using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods, employing a gradient reversal layer to force bias-invariant representation learning, adapted from healthcare AI fairness techniques.

Result: The framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6%, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2%, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811) across 87 upazilas in 11 districts.

Conclusion: Algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools for equitable disaster recovery by prioritizing aid based on genuine need.

Abstract: Post-disaster aid allocation in developing nations often suffers from systematic biases that disadvantage vulnerable regions, perpetuating historical inequities. This paper presents a fairness-aware artificial intelligence framework for prioritizing post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh, a country highly susceptible to recurring flood disasters. Using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods that affected 7.2 million people and caused 405.5 million US dollars in damages, we develop an adversarial debiasing model that predicts flood vulnerability while actively removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas. Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns. This work demonstrates how algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools to implement more equitable disaster recovery strategies.

### [5] [The Wisdom of Deliberating AI Crowds: Does Deliberation Improve LLM-Based Forecasting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22625)
*Paul Schneider,Amalie Schramm*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deliberation among large language models (LLMs) like GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini Pro 2.5 can improve forecasting accuracy in diverse model groups with shared information, but not in homogeneous groups or with extra contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured deliberation improves human forecasting accuracy; this study explores if a similar intervention (LLMs reviewing each other's forecasts before updating) can enhance accuracy in LLMs, using 202 resolved binary questions from a forecasting tournament.

Method: Assessed accuracy across four scenarios using 202 resolved binary questions from the Metaculus Q2 2025 AI Forecasting Tournament: (1) diverse models with distributed information, (2) diverse models with shared information, (3) homogeneous models with distributed information, and (4) homogeneous models with shared information.

Result: Intervention significantly improved accuracy in scenario (2) (diverse models with shared information), reducing Log Loss by 0.020 (about 4%, p = 0.017). No benefit observed in homogeneous groups. Additional contextual information did not improve forecast accuracy.

Conclusion: Deliberation may be a viable strategy for improving LLM forecasting, particularly in diverse model groups with shared information, but homogeneous groups or extra context do not yield benefits.

Abstract: Structured deliberation has been found to improve the performance of human forecasters. This study investigates whether a similar intervention, i.e. allowing LLMs to review each other's forecasts before updating, can improve accuracy in large language models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini Pro 2.5). Using 202 resolved binary questions from the Metaculus Q2 2025 AI Forecasting Tournament, accuracy was assessed across four scenarios: (1) diverse models with distributed information, (2) diverse models with shared information, (3) homogeneous models with distributed information, and (4) homogeneous models with shared information. Results show that the intervention significantly improves accuracy in scenario (2), reducing Log Loss by 0.020 or about 4 percent in relative terms (p = 0.017). However, when homogeneous groups (three instances of the same model) engaged in the same process, no benefit was observed. Unexpectedly, providing LLMs with additional contextual information did not improve forecast accuracy, limiting our ability to study information pooling as a mechanism. Our findings suggest that deliberation may be a viable strategy for improving LLM forecasting.

*Shaun Khoo,Jessica Foo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Agentic Risk & Capability (ARC) Framework to help organizations manage risks from autonomous AI agents by identifying, assessing, and mitigating them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems pose novel risks due to autonomous actions like code execution and internet interaction, challenging organizational governance in risk management.

Method: The framework develops a capability-centric perspective, identifies three risk sources (components, design, capabilities), links risks to technical controls, and provides a practical implementation approach.

Result: ARC Framework offers a structured methodology for organizations to navigate agentic AI complexities, enabling safe and innovative deployment while mitigating diverse and evolving risks.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, adaptable tool for responsible governance of agentic AI, open-sourced for broader adoption and collaboration in technical risk management.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems present both significant opportunities and novel risks due to their capacity for autonomous action, encompassing tasks such as code execution, internet interaction, and file modification. This poses considerable challenges for effective organizational governance, particularly in comprehensively identifying, assessing, and mitigating diverse and evolving risks. To tackle this, we introduce the Agentic Risk \& Capability (ARC) Framework, a technical governance framework designed to help organizations identify, assess, and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI systems. The framework's core contributions are: (1) it develops a novel capability-centric perspective to analyze a wide range of agentic AI systems; (2) it distills three primary sources of risk intrinsic to agentic AI systems - components, design, and capabilities; (3) it establishes a clear nexus between each risk source, specific materialized risks, and corresponding technical controls; and (4) it provides a structured and practical approach to help organizations implement the framework. This framework provides a robust and adaptable methodology for organizations to navigate the complexities of agentic AI, enabling rapid and effective innovation while ensuring the safe, secure, and responsible deployment of agentic AI systems. Our framework is open-sourced \href{https://govtech-responsibleai.github.io/agentic-risk-capability-framework/}{here}.

### [7] [SPIRAL: Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23167)
*Yifan Zhang,Giridhar Ganapavarapu,Srideepika Jayaraman,Bhavna Agrawal,Dhaval Patel,Achille Fokoue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPIRAL is a new LLM-based planning framework using three specialized agents integrated with MCTS to improve exploration and self-correction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with complex planning due to linear reasoning and inability to recover from errors, while traditional search methods like MCTS are inefficient with sparse rewards and underutilize LLMs' semantic capabilities.

Method: The SPIRAL framework embeds three LLM agents (Planner, Simulator, Critic) into a Monte Carlo Tree Search loop, creating an integrated pipeline where the Planner proposes steps, the Simulator grounds by predicting outcomes, and the Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection.

Result: SPIRAL consistently outperforms Chain-of-Thought planning and other state-of-the-art agents on DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, achieving up to 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, a 16+ percentage point improvement, while also showing superior token efficiency.

Conclusion: Structuring LLM reasoning as a guided, reflective, and grounded search process enhances robustness and efficiency in autonomous planning, as demonstrated by SPIRAL's success, with open-source materials available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often falter at complex planning tasks that require exploration and self-correction, as their linear reasoning process struggles to recover from early mistakes. While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency. Our work demonstrates that structuring LLM reasoning as a guided, reflective, and grounded search process yields more robust and efficient autonomous planners. The source code, full appendices, and all experimental data are available for reproducibility at the official project repository.

### [8] [We are not able to identify AI-generated images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22236)
*Adrien Pavão*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study shows humans have only 54% accuracy in distinguishing AI-generated portraits from real ones, barely above random chance, highlighting difficulty in detection and need for better awareness and ethics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the common assumption that people can easily differentiate AI-generated images from real photographs, using a controlled experiment with challenging cases.

Method: Conducted an interactive web experiment where participants classified 20 images (real vs. AI-generated) from a dataset of 120 difficult cases, with real images from CC12M and AI counterparts from MidJourney, involving 165 users completing 233 sessions.

Result: Average accuracy was 54%, only slightly above random guessing, with limited improvement across attempts; response time averaged 7.3 seconds, and some images were consistently more deceptive than others.

Conclusion: Humans struggle to reliably detect AI-generated content even on simple portraits, suggesting that synthetic media is becoming difficult to distinguish from reality, emphasizing the need for greater awareness and ethical guidelines as AI-generated media improves.

Abstract: AI-generated images are now pervasive online, yet many people believe they can easily tell them apart from real photographs. We test this assumption through an interactive web experiment where participants classify 20 images as real or AI-generated. Our dataset contains 120 difficult cases: real images sampled from CC12M, and carefully curated AI-generated counterparts produced with MidJourney. In total, 165 users completed 233 sessions. Their average accuracy was 54%, only slightly above random guessing, with limited improvement across repeated attempts. Response times averaged 7.3 seconds, and some images were consistently more deceptive than others. These results indicate that, even on relatively simple portrait images, humans struggle to reliably detect AI-generated content. As synthetic media continues to improve, human judgment alone is becoming insufficient for distinguishing real from artificial data. These findings highlight the need for greater awareness and ethical guidelines as AI-generated media becomes increasingly indistinguishable from reality.

### [9] [Shape of Thought: When Distribution Matters More than Correctness in Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22255)
*Abhranil Chandra,Ayush Agrawal,Arian Hosseini,Sebastian Fischmeister,Rishabh Agarwal,Navin Goyal,Aaron Courville*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using synthetic chain-of-thought data with wrong answers can improve reasoning more than human data, due to distribution alignment and partial validity of reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models can learn reasoning capabilities from synthetic chain-of-thought data that contains errors, potentially outperforming human-annotated datasets.

Method: Generate synthetic CoT traces from more capable models, even if they lead to incorrect answers. Also, paraphrase human traces to shift distribution and introduce flawed CoT traces to test tolerance.

Result: Training on synthetic CoT data with incorrect answers improves reasoning performance more than human-annotated data. Paraphrasing human traces boosts performance. Models show tolerance to partially flawed reasoning steps.

Conclusion: The study concludes that synthetic CoT data from more capable models can enhance reasoning capabilities even with incorrect final answers, highlighting the importance of data distribution alignment with the model's own distribution over final answer correctness.

Abstract: We present the surprising finding that a language model's reasoning capabilities can be improved by training on synthetic datasets of chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from more capable models, even when all of those traces lead to an incorrect final answer. Our experiments show this approach can yield better performance on reasoning tasks than training on human-annotated datasets. We hypothesize that two key factors explain this phenomenon: first, the distribution of synthetic data is inherently closer to the language model's own distribution, making it more amenable to learning. Second, these `incorrect' traces are often only partially flawed and contain valid reasoning steps from which the model can learn. To further test the first hypothesis, we use a language model to paraphrase human-annotated traces -- shifting their distribution closer to the model's own distribution -- and show that this improves performance. For the second hypothesis, we introduce increasingly flawed CoT traces and study to what extent models are tolerant to these flaws. We demonstrate our findings across various reasoning domains like math, algorithmic reasoning and code generation using MATH, GSM8K, Countdown and MBPP datasets on various language models ranging from 1.5B to 9B across Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models. Our study shows that curating datasets that are closer to the model's distribution is a critical aspect to consider. We also show that a correct final answer is not always a reliable indicator of a faithful reasoning process.

### [10] [Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP): A Deterministic and Interpretable Prompting Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22258)
*Satvik Tripathi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) improves rule adherence and auditability in LLMs for clinical decision tasks, achieving higher accuracy than other prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with strict rule adherence, determinism, and auditability in tasks like clinical decision support, necessitating a more reliable prompting framework.

Method: Logic Sketch Prompting introduces typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and rule-based validators to ensure traceable outputs. It is benchmarked against zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and concise prompting on Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3 models using pharmacologic logic compliance tasks.

Result: LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83-0.89) and F1 scores (0.83-0.89) across tasks and models, outperforming other methods with statistically significant gains (p < 0.01).

Conclusion: LSP enhances determinism, interpretability, and consistency in LLM outputs without performance loss, making it suitable for safety-critical systems like clinical decision support.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language reasoning but remain unreliable on tasks requiring strict rule adherence, determinism, and auditability. Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) is a lightweight prompting framework that introduces typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and a rule based validator that produces traceable and repeatable outputs. Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75). McNemar tests show statistically significant gains for LSP across nearly all comparisons (p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that LSP improves determinism, interpretability, and consistency without sacrificing performance, supporting its use in clinical, regulated, and safety critical decision support systems.

*Mengkang Hu,Bowei Xia,Yuran Wu,Ailing Yu,Yude Zou,Qiguang Chen,Shijian Wang,Jiarui Jin,Kexin Li,Wenxiang Jiao,Yuan Lu,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent2World is a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that generates symbolic world models via multi-agent feedback, improving both inference-time performance and supervised fine-tuning for world-model generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLMs to generate symbolic world models (like PDDL domains) lacks large-scale verifiable supervision, and current validation methods fail to detect behavior-level errors from interactive execution.

Method: Agent2World uses a three-stage pipeline: 1) Deep Researcher agent performs web searching for knowledge synthesis to fill specification gaps, 2) Model Developer agent implements executable world models, and 3) Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation for feedback.

Result: Agent2World achieved state-of-the-art inference-time performance across three benchmarks for PDDL and executable code, and the Testing Team's feedback enabled fine-tuning that improved world-model generation by an average relative gain of 30.95%.

Conclusion: The framework effectively generates accurate world models through multi-agent collaboration, addressing supervision gaps and enhancing both inference and training for symbolic world-model generation tasks.

Abstract: Symbolic world models (e.g., PDDL domains or executable simulators) are central to model-based planning, but training LLMs to generate such world models is limited by the lack of large-scale verifiable supervision. Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

### [13] [Subgoaling Relaxation-based Heuristics for Numeric Planning with Infinite Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22367)
*Ángel Aso-Mollar,Diego Aineto,Enrico Scala,Eva Onaindia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A compilation method is introduced to transform controllable, simple numeric planning problems with infinite action parameters into simpler numeric tasks, enabling the use of traditional heuristics to estimate goal distance effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numeric planning with control parameters introduces infinite possible actions, making existing numeric heuristics infeasible; this paper aims to develop a tractable approach to apply traditional heuristics in such settings.

Method: An optimistic compilation approach is proposed, abstracting control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions to transform the problems into simple numeric tasks.

Result: The approach enables effective use of subgoaling heuristics for estimating goal distance, demonstrating computational feasibility and pushing state-of-the-art boundaries.

Conclusion: This work provides an effective and feasible method to extend numeric heuristics to planning problems with infinite actions, enhancing the capability of numeric planning systems.

Abstract: Numeric planning with control parameters extends the standard numeric planning model by introducing action parameters as free numeric variables that must be instantiated during planning. This results in a potentially infinite number of applicable actions in a state. In this setting, off-the-shelf numeric heuristics that leverage the action structure are not feasible. In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an effective and computationally feasible way of applying traditional numeric heuristics to settings with an infinite number of possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art.

### [14] [HalluMat: Detecting Hallucinations in LLM-Generated Materials Science Content Through Multi-Stage Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22396)
*Bhanu Prakash Vangala,Sajid Mahmud,Pawan Neupane,Joel Selvaraj,Jianlin Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Developed HalluMatData benchmark and HalluMatDetector framework to detect and mitigate hallucination in LLM-generated materials science content, reducing hallucination rates by 30% with the introduction of PHCS metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucination issues in LLMs, which generate factually incorrect information in scientific contexts like materials science, compromising research integrity.

Method: Created the HalluMatData benchmark dataset and proposed HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment.

Result: Hallucination levels vary across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries showing more factual inconsistencies. Using HalluMatDetector reduces hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs.

Conclusion: HalluMatData and HalluMatDetector effectively tackle LLM hallucinations in materials science, improving factual consistency and model reliability through verification and the new PHCS metric.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming scientific discovery, enabling rapid knowledge generation and hypothesis formulation. However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability.

*Ozan Oguztuzun,Cerag Oguztuzun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GatedBias, a lightweight method for personalizing knowledge graph embeddings to user preferences using structure-gated adaptation with minimal parameters, improving alignment while maintaining global accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models for knowledge graphs perform well at the cohort level but struggle to capture individual user preferences, creating a disconnect between general relational reasoning and personalized ranking.

Method: Introduces GatedBias, a framework that adapts frozen KG embeddings via structure-gated adaptation, combining user-specific features and binary gates to produce interpretable biases per entity, with only ~300 trainable parameters without retraining.

Result: Evaluated on Amazon-Book and Last-FM datasets, GatedBias shows statistically significant improvements in alignment metrics while preserving cohort-level performance, with counterfactual experiments confirming causal responsiveness and significant rank boosts for targeted entities.

Conclusion: Personalized adaptation in foundation models can be efficient and verifiable, bridging general knowledge with individual needs.

Abstract: Foundation models for knowledge graphs (KGs) achieve strong cohort-level performance in link prediction, yet fail to capture individual user preferences; a key disconnect between general relational reasoning and personalized ranking. We propose GatedBias, a lightweight inference-time personalization framework that adapts frozen KG embeddings to individual user contexts without retraining or compromising global accuracy. Our approach introduces structure-gated adaptation: profile-specific features combine with graph-derived binary gates to produce interpretable, per-entity biases, requiring only ${\sim}300$ trainable parameters. We evaluate GatedBias on two benchmark datasets (Amazon-Book and Last-FM), demonstrating statistically significant improvements in alignment metrics while preserving cohort performance. Counterfactual perturbation experiments validate causal responsiveness; entities benefiting from specific preference signals show 6--30$\times$ greater rank improvements when those signals are boosted. These results show that personalized adaptation of foundation models can be both parameter-efficient and causally verifiable, bridging general knowledge representations with individual user needs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new architectural paradigm called Monadic Context Engineering (MCE) is introduced to formalize the design of autonomous AI agents using algebraic structures (Functors, Applicative Functors, Monads), addressing brittleness in state, error, and concurrency management, and enabling meta-agents for generative orchestration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous agent architectures for LLMs are often built with imperative, ad hoc patterns, leading to brittle systems with problems in state management, error handling, and concurrency.

Method: Proposes Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), leveraging Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to treat agent workflows as computational contexts that intrinsically manage cross-cutting concerns like state propagation, error handling, and asynchronous execution using algebraic properties, and extends it with Monad Transformers for systematic composition and Meta-Agents for generative orchestration.

Result: MCE provides a formal foundation for constructing AI agents from simple, verifiable components, enabling robust sequential composition, principled parallel execution, and layered composition of capabilities, leading to more resilient and efficient systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that MCE offers a novel paradigm to overcome the brittleness of current agent designs by leveraging algebraic structures, facilitating the development of complex, autonomous AI agents through systematic composition and generative orchestration via meta-agents.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about manipulative or deceptive behaviors that can undermine user autonomy, trust, and well-being. Existing safety benchmarks predominantly rely on coarse binary labels and fail to capture the nuanced psychological and social mechanisms constituting manipulation. We introduce \textbf{DarkPatterns-LLM}, a comprehensive benchmark dataset and diagnostic framework for fine-grained assessment of manipulative content in LLM outputs across seven harm categories: Legal/Power, Psychological, Emotional, Physical, Autonomy, Economic, and Societal Harm. Our framework implements a four-layer analytical pipeline comprising Multi-Granular Detection (MGD), Multi-Scale Intent Analysis (MSIAN), Threat Harmonization Protocol (THP), and Deep Contextual Risk Alignment (DCRA). The dataset contains 401 meticulously curated examples with instruction-response pairs and expert annotations. Through evaluation of state-of-the-art models including GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and LLaMA-3-70B, we observe significant performance disparities (65.2\%--89.7\%) and consistent weaknesses in detecting autonomy-undermining patterns. DarkPatterns-LLM establishes the first standardized, multi-dimensional benchmark for manipulation detection in LLMs, offering actionable diagnostics toward more trustworthy AI systems.

*Yiming Lu,Tingyu Lu,Di Zhang,Lili Ye,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-guided machine learning potential bridges quantum accuracy and large-scale simulation for aluminum nanoparticles, revealing temperature-dependent oxidation mechanisms and resolving mass transfer controversy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atomic mechanisms of aluminum nanoparticle combustion are unclear due to computational limits: ab initio methods are too small, empirical fields lack reactive fidelity.

Method: Human-in-the-loop closed-loop framework with self-auditing AI Agents validates a machine learning potential, enabling quantum accuracy at million-atom, nanosecond scales with low error rates.

Result: Simulations uncover a dual-mode oxidation: moderate temperatures show dynamic 'breathing mode' nanochannels, above critical threshold a 'rupture mode' causes explosive combustion. Aluminum cation outward diffusion dominates mass transfer, exceeding oxygen by 2-3 orders.

Conclusion: Unified atomic-scale framework established for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release via intelligent computation.

Abstract: Aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) are among the most energy-dense solid fuels, yet the atomic mechanisms governing their transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants remain elusive. This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a "human-in-the-loop" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic "gatekeeper," regulating oxidation through a "breathing mode" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a "rupture mode" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.

### [19] [Lessons from Neuroscience for AI: How integrating Actions, Compositional Structure and Episodic Memory could enable Safe, Interpretable and Human-Like AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22568)
*Rajesh P. N. Rao,Vishwas Sathish,Linxing Preston Jiang,Matthew Bryan,Prashant Rangarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating actions, hierarchical structure, and episodic memory into foundation models like LLMs to address current deficiencies and achieve safer, interpretable, and human-like AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models lack key components from predictive coding models in neuroscience, leading to issues like hallucinations, lack of grounding, interpretability, and energy inefficiency.

Method: The paper suggests augmenting foundation models with actions at multiple abstraction scales, a compositional generative architecture, and episodic memory, drawing from neuroscience and AI trends like CoT and RAG.

Result: This integration could improve grounding, agency, safety, and efficiency, with insights from brain science informing new ways to enhance AI models.

Conclusion: Reviving collaboration between brain science and AI can help develop safe and interpretable human-centered AI.

Abstract: The phenomenal advances in large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models over the past few years have been based on optimizing large-scale transformer models on the surprisingly simple objective of minimizing next-token prediction loss, a form of predictive coding that is also the backbone of an increasingly popular model of brain function in neuroscience and cognitive science. However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.

TL;DR: Proposes SANet, a semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that infers user goals and coordinates AI agents across layers, achieving better performance with fewer computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for autonomous, adaptive networking in complex wireless environments by leveraging AI agents that can infer user semantic goals and coordinate across network layers, while handling potential conflicts between decentralized agents.

Method: The paper proposes a semantic-aware AgentNet architecture (SANet) that uses a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework, formulates the optimization as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, develops two decentralized optimization algorithms, and creates a hardware prototype.

Result: Experimental results show performance gains up to 14.61% with only 44.37% of FLOPs compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, and theoretical bounds demonstrate a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SANet offers an effective semantic-aware AgentNet architecture with proven theoretical performance bounds and practical implementation advantages.

Abstract: Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm in which a large number of specialized AI agents collaborate to perform autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation, and complex missions. It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms.

TL;DR: M^3ob model uses multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge and LLM-enhanced knowledge graphs to improve human mobility prediction for location recommendation, addressing generalization and semantic gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for human mobility prediction suffer from limited generalization: unimodal approaches face data sparsity and biases, while multi-modal methods struggle with semantic gaps between static representations and spatial-temporal dynamics, hindering effective capture of mobility patterns.

Method: Construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) using LLM-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG) to represent multi-modal data functionally and temporally. Then, employ a gating mechanism to fuse these graph representations across modalities and use STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject dynamic knowledge into static image modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on six public datasets show M^3ob achieves consistent improvements in normal scenarios and exhibits significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The M^3ob model effectively leverages multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to enhance mobility dynamics characterization, offering robust performance and generalization for location recommendation tasks, bridging gaps in current methods.

Abstract: The precise prediction of human mobility has produced significant socioeconomic impacts, such as location recommendations and evacuation suggestions. However, existing methods suffer from limited generalization capability: unimodal approaches are constrained by data sparsity and inherent biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to effectively capture mobility dynamics caused by the semantic gap between static multi-modal representation and spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, we leverage multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics for the location recommendation task, dubbed as \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Mob}ility (\textbf{M}$^3$\textbf{ob}). First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality. Extensive experiments on six public datasets show that our proposed method not only achieves consistent improvements in normal scenarios but also exhibits significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.

TL;DR: SimVC-CAS is a multi-agent system that simulates VC decision-making as collective investor interactions, improving startup funding prediction accuracy by 25% and offering interpretable group dynamics modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional startup success prediction approaches typically model from the perspective of a single decision-maker, overlooking the collective dynamics of investor groups that dominate real-world venture capital decisions. There's a need to capture both enterprise fundamentals and behavioral dynamics of investor networks.

Method: The authors design a collective agent system with role-playing agents representing individual investors with unique traits and preferences, integrated with a GNN-based supervised interaction module. The system uses a graph-structured co-investment network to model heterogeneous evaluations and realistic information exchange among potential investors.

Result: Using real-world data from PitchBook with strict data leakage controls, SimVC-CAS shows significant improvements in predictive accuracy (approximately 25% relative improvement in average precision@10) while providing interpretable, multi-perspective reasoning. The system also demonstrates applicability to other complex group decision scenarios.

Conclusion: The SimVC-CAS system successfully models venture capital funding decisions as a multi-agent collective decision-making process, improving both predictive accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional single-perspective approaches.

Abstract: Due to the high value and high failure rate of startups, predicting their success has become a critical challenge across interdisciplinary research. Existing approaches typically model success prediction from the perspective of a single decision-maker, overlooking the collective dynamics of investor groups that dominate real-world venture capital (VC) decisions. In this paper, we propose SimVC-CAS, a novel collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as a multi-agent interaction process. By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10. SimVC-CAS also sheds light on other complex group decision scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for RAG systems lack interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and computational efficiency, hindering trustworthy deployment.

Method: DICE uses a two-stage, evidence-coupled framework with deep analytical reasoning and probabilistic scoring, combined with a Swiss-system tournament to optimize comparisons.

Result: DICE reduces computational complexity by 42.9% in an eight-system evaluation and achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts on a Chinese financial QA dataset.

Conclusion: DICE establishes a responsible, explainable, and efficient paradigm for trustworthy RAG system assessment.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems evolve toward more sophisticated architectures, ensuring their trustworthiness through explainable and robust evaluation becomes critical. Existing scalar metrics suffer from limited interpretability, inadequate uncertainty quantification, and computational inefficiency in multi-system comparisons, hindering responsible deployment of RAG technologies. We introduce DICE (Discrete Interpretable Comparative Evaluation), a two-stage, evidence-coupled framework that advances explainability and robustness in RAG evaluation. DICE combines deep analytical reasoning with probabilistic $\{A, B, Tie\}$ scoring to produce transparent, confidence-aware judgments that support accountable system improvement through interpretable reasoning traces, enabling systematic error diagnosis and actionable insights. To address efficiency challenges at scale, DICE employs a Swiss-system tournament that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \log N)$, achieving a 42.9% reduction in our eight-system evaluation while preserving ranking fidelity. Validation on a curated Chinese financial QA dataset demonstrates that DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts, substantially outperforming existing LLM-based metrics such as RAGAS. Our results establish DICE as a responsible, explainable, and efficient paradigm for trustworthy RAG system assessment.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM agents in travel planning lack domain coverage and dynamic multi-turn interaction, failing to assess agent capabilities comprehensively.

Method: Collect real-world user requests, construct subsets (multi-turn, single-turn, unsolvable), build a sandbox with 10 travel-domain tools for deterministic evaluation.

Result: Introduces TravelBench as a stable and reproducible benchmark; evaluates multiple LLMs, analyzing their behaviors and performance in travel planning tasks.

Conclusion: TravelBench provides a practical and reproducible benchmark to advance LLM agents in travel planning by addressing limitations in interaction and evaluation.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in planning and tool use. Travel planning provides a natural and high-impact testbed for these capabilities, as it requires multi-step reasoning, iterative preference elicitation through interaction, and calls to external tools under evolving constraints. Prior work has studied LLMs on travel-planning tasks, but existing settings are limited in domain coverage and multi-turn interaction. As a result, they cannot support dynamic user-agent interaction and therefore fail to comprehensively assess agent capabilities. In this paper, we introduce TravelBench, a real-world travel-planning benchmark featuring multi-turn interaction and tool use. We collect user requests from real-world scenarios and construct three subsets-multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable-to evaluate different aspects of agent performance. For stable and reproducible evaluation, we build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools, providing deterministic tool outputs for reliable reasoning. We evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an analysis of their behaviors and performance. TravelBench offers a practical and reproducible benchmark for advancing LLM agents in travel planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for continual learning in AI agents using episodic memory and reinforcement learning without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large language model agents to adapt continually through interaction without relying on backpropagation or model fine-tuning.

Method: Introduces the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, modeling reflection as read-write interactions with episodic memory.

Result: Shows the process induces an equivalent Markov decision process, establishes convergence guarantees for entropy-regularized policy iteration.

Conclusion: Provides a principled foundation for memory-augmented language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates.

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for continual and experiential learning in large language model agents that integrates episodic memory with reinforcement learning. The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates.

TL;DR: A novel hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework called SAMP-HDRL is proposed for portfolio optimization in changing markets, outperforming benchmarks with improved returns, risk-adjusted metrics, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Portfolio optimization in non-stationary markets is challenging due to regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and limited interpretability of DRL policies.

Method: The framework uses dynamic asset grouping, an upper-level agent for global market signals, lower-level agents for intra-group allocation, and a utility-based capital allocation mechanism to integrate risky and risk-free assets.

Result: Backtests from 2019 to 2021 show SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks, achieving at least 5% higher Return, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and 2% higher Omega ratio, with larger gains in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm the importance of coordination, clustering, and allocation.

Conclusion: SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints into the DRL pipeline, offering enhanced adaptability, robustness, and interpretability for complex financial environments, with a transparent decision-making mechanism.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization in non-stationary markets is challenging due to regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and the limited interpretability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\% higher Return, 5\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making. Overall, SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints directly into the DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scientific intelligence benchmarks are fragmented, focusing on narrow tasks rather than reflecting the hierarchical and holistic nature of real scientific inquiry, which includes abilities from fundamental knowledge to creative discovery.

Method: The authors develop HiSciBench, a benchmark with 8,735 curated instances across six disciplines (mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, astronomy), structured into five levels: Scientific Literacy (L1), Literature Parsing (L2), Literature-based Question Answering (L3), Literature Review Generation (L4), and Scientific Discovery (L5). It supports multimodal inputs (text, equations, figures, tables) and cross-lingual evaluation, providing an integrated, dependency-aware framework for diagnosis.

Result: Evaluations of leading models (e.g., GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, and multimodal systems) show substantial performance declines from basic to advanced tasks: up to 69% accuracy on L1 literacy tasks but only 25% on L5 discovery-level challenges, highlighting capability gaps.

Conclusion: HiSciBench sets a new standard for evaluating scientific intelligence by offering a comprehensive, hierarchical benchmark that enables detailed model diagnosis and provides actionable insights for developing more capable and reliable models. It will be publicly released to support future research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models has sparked growing interest in their potential for scientific research. However, scientific intelligence encompasses a broad spectrum of abilities ranging from understanding fundamental knowledge to conducting creative discovery, and existing benchmarks remain fragmented. Most focus on narrow tasks and fail to reflect the hierarchical and multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. We introduce \textbf{HiSciBench}, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models across five levels that mirror the complete scientific workflow: \textit{Scientific Literacy} (L1), \textit{Literature Parsing} (L2), \textit{Literature-based Question Answering} (L3), \textit{Literature Review Generation} (L4), and \textit{Scientific Discovery} (L5). HiSciBench contains 8,735 carefully curated instances spanning six major scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and astronomy, and supports multimodal inputs including text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as cross-lingual evaluation. Unlike prior benchmarks that assess isolated abilities, HiSciBench provides an integrated, dependency-aware framework that enables detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations of leading models, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, and several multimodal systems, reveal substantial performance gaps: while models achieve up to 69\% accuracy on basic literacy tasks, performance declines sharply to 25\% on discovery-level challenges. HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific Intelligence and offers actionable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more reliable. The benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

*Ling Xin,Mojtaba Nayyeri,Zahra Makki Nayeri,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Gamma is a knowledge graph foundation model that uses multi-head geometric attention with diverse algebraic transformations to improve zero-shot inductive link prediction over existing models like Ultra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge graph foundation models like Ultra rely on a single relational transformation in message passing, limiting expressiveness and ability to capture diverse relational and structural patterns across different graphs.

Method: Introduces multi-head geometric attention with parallel transformations based on real, complex, split-complex, and dual numbers, fused adaptively via a relational conditioned attention mechanism with entropy regularization at the link level.

Result: Outperforms Ultra with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on inductive benchmarks and 4.4% across all benchmarks in experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: Gamma's combination of multiple geometric representations enhances expressiveness and robustness in zero-shot inductive reasoning, demonstrating benefits over single-transformation approaches.

Abstract: Structural knowledge graph foundation models aim to generalize reasoning to completely new graphs with unseen entities and relations. A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.

### [30] [Multimodal Fact-Checking: An Agent-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22933)
*Danni Xu,Shaojing Fan,Xuanang Cheng,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces RW-Post, a high-quality, explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking, and proposes AgentFact, an agent-based framework to improve accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for automated fact-checking of multimodal misinformation struggle due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence use, partly because of a lack of datasets with annotated reasoning and verifiable evidence.

Method: The authors create RW-Post by aligning real-world multimodal claims with original social media posts and extracting detailed reasoning and evidence from human fact-checking articles using an LLM-assisted pipeline. They also propose AgentFact, a framework with five specialized agents for strategy planning, evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation, coordinated through an iterative workflow.

Result: Experiments show that combining RW-Post and AgentFact significantly enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking systems.

Conclusion: The synergy between the RW-Post dataset and the AgentFact framework addresses key limitations in current multimodal fact-checking, offering a more effective and explainable solution for combating misinformation.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation poses a growing challenge for automated fact-checking systems. Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.

### [31] [Problems With Large Language Models for Learner Modelling: Why LLMs Alone Fall Short for Responsible Tutoring in K--12 Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23036)
*Danial Hooshyar,Yeongwook Yang,Gustav Šíř,Tommi Kärkkäinen,Raija Hämäläinen,Mutlu Cukurova,Roger Azevedo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based tutors face critical limitations in assessing learners' knowledge evolution compared to deep knowledge tracing models, recommending hybrid frameworks for responsible tutoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address misconceptions about generative models replacing traditional learner modelling in high-risk K-12 education, as highlighted by the EU AI Act, to evaluate LLM-based tutors.

Method: Compare a deep knowledge tracing model with an LLM (zero-shot and fine-tuned) using a large open-access dataset, analyzing accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence.

Result: DKT achieves higher discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83), outperforms LLM consistently, shows stable mastery updates, and requires less computational resources than LLM, which exhibits temporal weaknesses.

Conclusion: LLMs alone are ineffective for intelligent tutoring systems; responsible education requires hybrid frameworks integrating learner modelling to overcome LLM limitations.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language model (LLM)-based tutors in K--12 education has fostered a misconception that generative models can replace traditional learner modelling for adaptive instruction. This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling.

### [32] [The Reward Model Selection Crisis in Personalized Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23067)
*Fady Rezk,Yuangang Pan,Chuan-Sheng Foo,Xun Xu,Nancy Chen,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current personalized alignment methods optimize reward model (RM) accuracy, but this fails to predict actual deployment performance under inference constraints, as shown by weak correlation with policy accuracy and a new benchmark Pref-LaMP, revealing the need for better metrics and approaches like in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that reward models in personalized alignment are optimized for RM accuracy (ranking user preferences), but this may not translate to effective token-level generation when using reward-guided decoding (RGD) at deployment, leading to a gap between ranking performance and real behavioral adaptation.

Method: The method involves introducing policy accuracy to assess whether scoring functions in RGD correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses, conducting systematic evaluations across three datasets, and creating Pref-LaMP, a benchmark with ground-truth user completions for direct behavioral assessment, with comparisons to methods like in-context learning.

Result: Results show weak correlation between RM accuracy and policy discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08-0.31). On Pref-LaMP, RM accuracy differences of up to 20 points lead to similar output quality, indicating decoupling between discrimination and generation. In-context learning outperforms reward methods, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains at 7B scale.

Conclusion: The conclusion challenges the assumption that better RM accuracy ensures better personalized alignment, exposes flaws in proxy metrics for deployment readiness, and highlights the necessity of developing new evaluation frameworks and approaches, such as in-context learning, that directly measure behavioral adaptation under practical constraints.

Abstract: Personalized alignment from preference data has focused primarily on improving reward model (RM) accuracy, with the implicit assumption that better preference ranking translates to better personalized behavior. However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale. These findings show that the field optimizes proxy metrics that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints.

TL;DR: ChexReason vision-language model trained with limited resources shows RL improves in-distribution performance but harms cross-dataset generalization, suggesting SFT may be better for clinical robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore resource-constrained application of RL for LLMs to medical imaging, which remains underexplored.

Method: R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU.

Result: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH).

Conclusion: Curated supervised fine-tuning may outperform aggressive reinforcement learning for clinical deployment requiring robustness across diverse populations.

Abstract: Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) advances for Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved reasoning tasks, yet their resource-constrained application to medical imaging remains underexplored. We introduce ChexReason, a vision-language model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU. Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons show structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but offer minimal gain for medically pre-trained models. Consequently, curated supervised fine-tuning may outperform aggressive RL for clinical deployment requiring robustness across diverse populations.

*Yu Li,Tian Lan,Zhengling Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (q) addresses DPO/RLHF limitations by enabling LLM self-reflection, offering plug-and-play improvements in alignment without extra inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become standard for aligning Large Language Models but suffer from two key limitations: optimal policy dependence on arbitrary modeling choices, leading to artifacts, and failure to leverage comparative pairwise data, missing self-reflection potential.

Method: Propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (q), which derives a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses, ensuring invariance to scalarization and reference choices.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating enhanced robustness and human alignment.

Conclusion: Unlocking self-reflection through q yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become standard for aligning Large Language Models due to their simplicity and offline stability. However, we identify two fundamental limitations. First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs.

*Max Parks,Kheli Atluru,Meera Vinod,Mike Kuniavsky,Jud Brewer,Sean White,Sarah Adler,Wendy Ju*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues current emotional intelligence evaluation frameworks for AI are inadequate and lack a foundation in emotion theories, proposes a review of applicable EI theories, critiques benchmarks, and suggests improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for assessing emotional intelligence in AI systems fail to properly measure relevant aspects, as they don't consider that some human EI components (like phenomenological understanding) are irrelevant for AI, while neglecting abilities AI can perform, and lack grounding in emotion theory.

Method: The authors review different theories of emotion and general emotional intelligence to assess their applicability to artificial systems, then critically evaluate available benchmark frameworks to identify shortcomings based on the derived account of EI.

Result: The analysis identifies gaps in current benchmarks, which often lack a solid foundation in the nature of emotion and emotional intelligence, highlighting specific areas where these frameworks fall short in evaluating AI systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by outlining options to improve evaluation strategies for emotional intelligence in AI systems, aiming to address the identified shortcomings and develop more comprehensive and relevant assessment frameworks.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop the position that current frameworks for evaluating emotional intelligence (EI) in artificial intelligence (AI) systems need refinement because they do not adequately or comprehensively measure the various aspects of EI relevant in AI. Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems.

### [36] [From Model Choice to Model Belief: Establishing a New Measure for LLM-Based Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23184)
*Hongshen Sun,Juanjuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes 'model belief' to improve efficiency of using LLM-generated data by leveraging token-level probabilities, showing better statistical performance than traditional 'model choice'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current practices treat LLM outputs as single data points, underutilizing probabilistic information, leading to inefficiency in simulation tasks.

Method: Introduces and formalizes 'model belief' derived from LLM token-level probabilities, proving theoretical properties and demonstrating with demand estimation study.

Result: Model belief has lower variance, faster convergence, and in practical settings, explains/predicts model choice better, reducing computation by factor of 20.

Conclusion: Supports using model belief as default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data for improved efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior, but common practices to use LLM-generated data are inefficient. Treating an LLM's output ("model choice") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes "model belief," a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCEval is a new evaluation framework using thermal comfort scenarios to assess AI's cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, showing current LLMs have basic cross-modal reasoning but lack precise causal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical gap in LLM task-specific benchmarks, and thermal comfort serves as an ideal paradigm to evaluate real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems due to its complex interplay of environmental and personal factors.

Method: Initialize LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guide them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validate outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database.

Result: Experiments on four LLMs show agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves with a 1 PMV tolerance, LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification.

Conclusion: TCEval confirms feasibility as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning but lack precise causal understanding of nonlinear thermal comfort relationships, complementing traditional benchmarks and shifting focus to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making.

Abstract: A critical gap exists in LLM task-specific benchmarks. Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes domain-specific Agentic Physical AI foundation models, contrasting perception-centric general-purpose models, using physics-based validation for policy optimization to achieve stable control in physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI for physical systems relies on general-purpose foundation models with perception-centric architectures, leading to ~50% accuracy on basic physics tasks and input unfaithfulness, posing safety risks in control applications.

Method: Train a 360M-parameter compact language model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples, using physics-based validation for policy optimization.

Result: The model shows a sharp phase transition: small-scale systems have high-variance imitation with high risk, while large-scale ones achieve >500x variance reduction, stabilize execution, autonomously reject 70% of training distribution, concentrate 95% runtime on a single-bank strategy, and transfer across physics and modalities.

Conclusion: Agentic Physical AI offers a viable alternative to perception-centric models for safety-critical physical systems, achieving outcome-space guarantees through physics-driven validation, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the connection of two problems within the planning and verification community: Conformant planning and model-checking of hyperproperties. Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces of a system and, e.g., capture information-flow and fairness policies. In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\exists^*\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan. Firstly, we show that we can efficiently reduce a hyperproperty model-checking instance to a conformant planning instance, and prove that our encoding is sound and complete. Secondly, we establish the converse direction: Every conformant planning problem is, itself, a hyperproperty model-checking task.

Motivation: LLM agents struggle in physical-world tasks due to inadequate spatial mental models, with challenges in spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking, and active exploration under partial observation.

Method: Introduce CubeBench, a generative benchmark with a three-tiered diagnostic framework assessing capabilities from state tracking with full information to exploration with partial visual data.

Result: Experiments on leading LLMs show 0.00% pass rate on long-horizon tasks, indicating failure in long-term planning, with diagnostic tools used to isolate cognitive bottlenecks.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical gaps in LLM agents for physical tasks, providing insights to guide development of more physically-grounded intelligent agents through analysis of failure modes.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, while proficient in the digital realm, face a significant gap in physical-world deployment due to the challenge of forming and maintaining a robust spatial mental model. We identify three core cognitive challenges hindering this transition: spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking via mental simulation, and active exploration under partial observation. To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning. We also propose a diagnostic framework to isolate these cognitive bottlenecks by providing external solver tools. By analyzing the failure modes, we provide key insights to guide the development of more physically-grounded intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional workflow-based agents are limited in addressing real-world problems requiring tool usage, motivating the development of autonomous reasoning agents.

Method: MindWatcher uses interleaved thinking to switch between thinking and tool calling at any stage, multimodal CoT for image manipulation, automated data pipelines, curated datasets, a comprehensive tool suite, and a local image retrieval database.

Result: MindWatcher matches or exceeds larger or more recent models' performance via superior tool invocation and uncovers insights like genetic inheritance in agentic RL.

Conclusion: MindWatcher demonstrates the effectiveness of TIR agents for complex decision-making, with potential for agent training improvements.

Abstract: Traditional workflow-based agents exhibit limited intelligence when addressing real-world problems requiring tool invocation. Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) agents capable of autonomous reasoning and tool invocation are rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for complex decision-making tasks involving multi-step interactions with external environments. In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes continual learning from an embedded agent perspective, introducing interactivity as an objective to measure continual adaptation and showing deep linear networks outperform deep nonlinear networks in sustaining interactivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the big world hypothesis, emphasizing that the agent is inherently constrained by being embedded in the environment, which motivates moving beyond explicit constraints to a more fundamental embedding perspective. This avoids ad hoc limitations and aligns with infinite state-space learning scenarios.

Method: The method involves introducing a computationally-embedded perspective to represent agents as automata in a universal computer, proving equivalence to agents in partially observable Markov decision processes over infinite states, and developing a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking applied to a synthetic problem.

Result: Results demonstrate that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity in the synthetic problem, while deep linear networks perform better and can sustain higher interactivity with increased capacity, highlighting their suitability for continual adaptation under constraints.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that an embedded agent framework provides a more natural constraint for continual learning, and linear network architectures are advantageous for scaling interactivity, suggesting directions for designing agents that better handle infinite state environments.

Abstract: Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that "the world is bigger" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.

Conclusion: AKG kernel agent effectively accelerates kernel development for modern AI applications, offering scalable automation to address computational challenges amid hardware and model complexity.

Abstract: Modern AI models demand high-performance computation kernels. The growing complexity of LLMs, multimodal architectures, and recommendation systems, combined with techniques like sparsity and quantization, creates significant computational challenges. Moreover, frequent hardware updates and diverse chip architectures further complicate this landscape, requiring tailored kernel implementations for each platform.

TL;DR: A novel RL framework called HiR uses a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes, improving sample efficiency for aligning LLMs with instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL for aligning LLMs often suffers from sparse rewards because initial models struggle to generate responses that meet all constraints, hindering learning.

Method: Proposes Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), which replays failed attempts as successes based on satisfied constraints, framing optimization as dual-preference learning with binary rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments show HiR yields promising results across tasks while requiring less computational budget.

Conclusion: HiR offers an efficient RL solution for complex instruction following by addressing reward sparsity through hindsight replay.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions with various constraints. Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework to predict venture capital startup success by reasoning over graph-structured data with multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation, improving performance on off-graph tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting VC success requires complex reasoning from heterogeneous graph data (like disclosures and networks), but traditional ML/GNNs lack reasoning, and LLMs struggle with graph modality, especially for off-graph tasks where targets are outside the network.

Method: MIRAGE-VC uses an information-gain-driven path retriever to select high-value neighbors and condense networks into chains for reasoning, with a multi-agent architecture and learnable gating to integrate evidence streams based on company attributes.

Result: Under anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, showing effectiveness for off-graph prediction in VC.

Conclusion: The framework addresses path explosion and heterogeneous evidence fusion, enhancing startup success prediction and potentially benefiting other off-graph tasks like recommendation and risk assessment.

Abstract: Most venture capital (VC) investments fail, while a few deliver outsized returns. Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

TL;DR: AI safety requires agents that reason under uncertainty and handle incomplete/non-Archimedean preferences, using assistance and shutdown game frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure AI systems align with human values and remain safe by addressing alignment and shutdown challenges.

Method: The method involves framing the problem through AI assistance and shutdown games, where agents must learn human utility functions and respond appropriately to shutdown signals.

Result: The result demonstrates that the challenges of AI assistance and shutdown require agents to reason under uncertainty and manage complex preference structures.

Conclusion: The analysis concludes that safe AI alignment requires agents capable of reasoning under uncertainty and handling both incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences.

Abstract: How can we ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values and remain safe? We can study this problem through the frameworks of the AI assistance and the AI shutdown games. The AI assistance problem concerns designing an AI agent that helps a human to maximise their utility function(s). However, only the human knows these function(s); the AI assistant must learn them. The shutdown problem instead concerns designing AI agents that: shut down when a shutdown button is pressed; neither try to prevent nor cause the pressing of the shutdown button; and otherwise accomplish their task competently. In this paper, we show that addressing these challenges requires AI agents that can reason under uncertainty and handle both incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CreativeDC is a two-phase prompting method for LLMs to generate diverse educational problems by decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, outperforming baselines in diversity and novelty while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face the 'Artificial Hivemind' effect, producing similar outputs and limiting diversity in educational problem generation, which harms student learning by reducing thought variety.

Method: Based on Wallas's creativity theory and Guilford's divergent-convergent thinking, CreativeDC scaffolds LLM reasoning into two phases: creative exploration followed by constraint satisfaction to generate varied problems.

Result: CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty than baselines, maintains high utility, and scales better by producing a larger effective number of distinct problems as sampling increases.

Conclusion: The method effectively mitigates LLM homogeneity, enhancing creative problem generation for educational materials, with implications for improving AI-assisted learning diversity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significant potential for generating educational questions and problems, enabling educators to create large-scale learning materials. However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.

*Federico Baldo,Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The I-PERI algorithm addresses federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions by recovering a union CPDAG and tightening the equivalence class to a Φ-Markov Equivalence Class.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated causal discovery methods assume all clients share the same causal model, which is unrealistic in practice due to heterogeneous interventions, such as different hospital protocols.

Method: I-PERI first recovers the CPDAG of the union graph across clients, then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences from interventions.

Result: The algorithm yields a tighter equivalence class called the Φ-Markov Equivalence Class, represented as a Φ-CPDAG, with theoretical guarantees on convergence and privacy, supported by empirical evaluations on synthetic data.

Conclusion: I-PERI effectively handles unknown interventions in federated settings, improving accuracy and privacy in causal discovery across heterogeneous clients.

Abstract: Most causal discovery methods recover a completed partially directed acyclic graph representing a Markov equivalence class from observational data. Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients. This yields a tighter equivalence class, which we call the $\mathbfΦ$-Markov Equivalence Class, represented by the $\mathbfΦ$-CPDAG. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of I-PERI, as well as on its privacy-preserving properties, and present empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: Web World Model (WWM) bridges fixed web frameworks and fully generative world models by implementing world state in web code for consistency while using LLMs for generation, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to persistent worlds for language agents are at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the cost of controllability and practical engineering. The authors seek a middle ground.

Method: The authors build Web World Models (WWM) on a realistic web stack where world state and physics are implemented in ordinary web code for logical consistency, while LLMs generate context, narratives, and decisions on top of this structured latent state. They demonstrate this across infinite travel atlas, fictional galaxy explorers, encyclopedic/narrative worlds, and simulation/game environments.

Result: The authors introduce Web World Model (WWM) as a middle ground and build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack. They identify practical design principles: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and using deterministic generation for unlimited but structured exploration.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that web stacks can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments by separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination.

Abstract: Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

### [51] [Pruning Graphs by Adversarial Robustness Evaluation to Strengthen GNN Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22128)
*Yongyu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework that uses adversarial robustness evaluation to prune graph edges, improving GNN reliability against perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to noise in graph structure and features, which is amplified through message passing.

Method: Introduce a pruning framework guided by robustness scores to selectively remove fragile edges, instantiated on three GNN architectures.

Result: Experiments show significant enhancement in GNN defense capability under high-perturbation conditions.

Conclusion: The pruning method effectively produces cleaner and more resilient graph representations, improving GNN robustness.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for learning on graph-structured data, thanks to their ability to jointly exploit node features and relational information encoded in the graph topology. This joint modeling, however, also introduces a critical weakness: perturbations or noise in either the structure or the features can be amplified through message passing, making GNNs highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and spurious connections. In this work, we introduce a pruning framework that leverages adversarial robustness evaluation to explicitly identify and remove fragile or detrimental components of the graph. By using robustness scores as guidance, our method selectively prunes edges that are most likely to degrade model reliability, thereby yielding cleaner and more resilient graph representations. We instantiate this framework on three representative GNN architectures and conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks. The experimental results show that our approach can significantly enhance the defense capability of GNNs in the high-perturbation regime.

TL;DR: LANCA is an unsupervised causal discovery model that uses the Additive Noise Model as an inductive bias, combining a deterministic WAE with a differentiable ANM Layer to improve identifiability and outperform baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised representation learning struggles with identifiability and capturing causal dependencies; existing methods fail without supervision or strong biases, and stochastic encodings in VAEs hinder latent causal discovery.

Method: Proposes LANCA, which operationalizes the ANM as an inductive bias, using a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM layer to make residual independence an explicit objective.

Result: LANCA resolves component-wise indeterminacy by restricting transformations to affine class; empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic benchmarks (Pendulum, Flow) and photorealistic environments (CANDLE) with robustness to spurious correlations.

Conclusion: LANCA demonstrates that the ANM bias, when integrated into a deterministic encoder, facilitates unsupervised causal discovery, offering theoretical and practical advances in disentangling causal variables from observational data.

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning seeks to recover latent generative factors, yet standard methods relying on statistical independence often fail to capture causal dependencies. A central challenge is identifiability: as established in disentangled representation learning and nonlinear ICA literature, disentangling causal variables from observational data is impossible without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong inductive biases. In this work, we propose the Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoder (LANCA) to operationalize the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias for unsupervised discovery. Theoretically, we prove that while the ANM constraint does not guarantee unique identifiability in the general mixing case, it resolves component-wise indeterminacy by restricting the admissible transformations from arbitrary diffeomorphisms to the affine class. Methodologically, arguing that the stochastic encoding inherent to VAEs obscures the structural residuals required for latent causal discovery, LANCA employs a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM Layer. This architecture transforms residual independence from a passive assumption into an explicit optimization objective. Empirically, LANCA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic physics benchmarks (Pendulum, Flow), and on photorealistic environments (CANDLE), where it demonstrates superior robustness to spurious correlations arising from complex background scenes.

TL;DR: SoliReward is a framework for training video reward models (RMs) using binary annotations, cross-prompt pairing, hierarchical attention, and modified loss to improve alignment and prevent reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training alignment of video generation models with human preferences needs effective RMs, but current methods face issues like noisy data from pairwise annotations, under-explored VLM-based RM architectures, and susceptibility to reward hacking.

Method: Proposed SoliReward framework: collect data via single-item binary annotations, form preference pairs with cross-prompt pairing, use Hierarchical Progressive Query Attention for feature aggregation, and apply a modified Bradley-Terry loss for win-tie scenarios to regularize score distributions.

Result: Validated on benchmarks for physical plausibility, subject deformity, and semantic alignment, showing improvements in RM metrics and enhanced post-training efficacy for video generation models.

Conclusion: SoliReward provides a systematic approach to overcome data, architecture, and loss challenges in video RM training, offering better alignment signals and reducing oversensitivity to top samples, with code and benchmark to be shared.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of video generation models with human preferences is a critical goal. Developing effective Reward Models (RMs) for this process faces significant methodological hurdles. Current data collection paradigms, reliant on in-prompt pairwise annotations, suffer from labeling noise. Concurrently, the architectural design of VLM-based RMs, particularly their output mechanisms, remains underexplored. Furthermore, RM is susceptible to reward hacking in post-training. To mitigate these limitations, we propose SoliReward, a systematic framework for video RM training. Our framework first sources high-quality, cost-efficient data via single-item binary annotations, then constructs preference pairs using a cross-prompt pairing strategy. Architecturally, we employ a Hierarchical Progressive Query Attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Finally, we introduce a modified BT loss that explicitly accommodates win-tie scenarios. This approach regularizes the RM's score distribution for positive samples, providing more nuanced preference signals to alleviate over-focus on a small number of top-scoring samples. Our approach is validated on benchmarks evaluating physical plausibility, subject deformity, and semantic alignment, demonstrating improvements in direct RM evaluation metrics and in the efficacy of post-training on video generation models. Code and benchmark will be publicly available.

TL;DR: TIDES is an LLM-based framework for urban wireless traffic prediction that uses clustering and fine-tuning to capture spatial-temporal correlations effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for intelligent resource management in wireless networks highlights the need for accurate traffic prediction, but existing deep learning and LLM methods often ignore spatial dependencies in city-scale traffic.

Method: Projects a framework with clustering to identify regional traffic patterns, trains personalized models, uses prompt engineering to convert numerical data to structured inputs, and integrates a DeepSeek module with cross-domain attention for spatial alignment while freezing core LLM layers for efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world cellular traffic datasets show TIDES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial awareness into LLM-based predictors is key to enabling scalable and intelligent network management in future 6G systems.

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent, adaptive resource management in next-generation wireless networks has underscored the importance of accurate and scalable wireless traffic prediction. While recent advancements in deep learning and foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising forecasting capabilities, they largely overlook the spatial dependencies inherent in city-scale traffic dynamics. In this paper, we propose TIDES (Traffic Intelligence with DeepSeek-Enhanced Spatial-temporal prediction), a novel LLM-based framework that captures spatial-temporal correlations for urban wireless traffic prediction. TIDES first identifies heterogeneous traffic patterns across regions through a clustering mechanism and trains personalized models for each region to balance generalization and specialization. To bridge the domain gap between numerical traffic data and language-based models, we introduce a prompt engineering scheme that embeds statistical traffic features as structured inputs. Furthermore, we design a DeepSeek module that enables spatial alignment via cross-domain attention, allowing the LLM to leverage information from spatially related regions. By fine-tuning only lightweight components while freezing core LLM layers, TIDES achieves efficient adaptation to domain-specific patterns without incurring excessive training overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world cellular traffic datasets demonstrate that TIDES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and robustness. Our results indicate that integrating spatial awareness into LLM-based predictors is the key to unlocking scalable and intelligent network management in future 6G systems.

*Rajeeb Thapa Chhetri,Zhixiong Chen,Saurab Thapa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel two-stage framework called Latent Sculpting improves zero-shot anomaly detection in high-dimensional tabular data by explicitly structuring the latent manifold and then estimating densities, outperforming supervised and unsupervised baselines on OOD data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised deep learning in high-dimensional tabular domains suffers from Generalization Collapse, where models fail catastrophically on Out-of-Distribution data due to lack of topological constraints in the latent space, leading to diffuse manifolds.

Method: Propose Latent Sculpting, a hierarchical two-stage framework: Stage 1 uses a hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer Encoder with a Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss to sculpt benign traffic into a low-entropy hyperspherical cluster; Stage 2 conditions a Masked Autoregressive Flow on this structured manifold for exact density estimation.

Result: Evaluation on CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark shows F1-Score of 0.87 on zero-shot anomalies, with an 88.89% detection rate on Infiltration scenarios, outperforming supervised baselines (F1 approx 0.30) and the strongest unsupervised baseline (0.76).

Conclusion: Explicit manifold sculpting is essential for robust zero-shot generalization, and decoupling structure learning from density estimation offers a scalable path toward generalized anomaly detection.

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of supervised deep learning in high-dimensional tabular domains is "Generalization Collapse": models learn precise decision boundaries for known distributions but fail catastrophically when facing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. We hypothesize that this failure stems from the lack of topological constraints in the latent space, resulting in diffuse manifolds where novel anomalies remain statistically indistinguishable from benign data. To address this, we propose Latent Sculpting, a hierarchical two-stage representation learning framework. Stage 1 utilizes a hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer Encoder trained with a novel Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to actively "sculpt" benign traffic into a low-entropy, hyperspherical cluster. Unlike standard contrastive losses that rely on triplet mining, DCCL optimizes global cluster centroids to enforce absolute manifold density. Stage 2 conditions a Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) on this pre-structured manifold to learn an exact density estimate. We evaluate this methodology on the rigorous CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark, treating it as a proxy for complex, non-stationary data streams. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit manifold sculpting is a prerequisite for robust zero-shot generalization. While supervised baselines suffered catastrophic performance collapse on unseen distribution shifts (F1 approx 0.30) and the strongest unsupervised baseline achieved only 0.76, our framework achieved an F1-Score of 0.87 on strictly zero-shot anomalies. Notably, we report an 88.89% detection rate on "Infiltration" scenarios--a complex distributional shift where state-of-the-art supervised models achieved 0.00% accuracy. These findings suggest that decoupling structure learning from density estimation provides a scalable path toward generalized anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework with Dueling Double Deep Q-Network and curriculum learning optimizes tennis strategy in a detailed simulator, showing high win rates with defensive tactics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tennis strategy optimization involves complex hierarchical scoring, stochastic outcomes, and adaptation to opponent skill, requiring an advanced learning model.

Method: The method uses a custom tennis simulation environment modeling scoring at points, games, and sets, with a Dueling DDQN trained via curriculum learning against progressively stronger opponents.

Result: Trained agent achieves 98-100% win rates vs. balanced opponents, serve efficiency 63.0-67.5%, return efficiency 52.8-57.1%, with Dueling DDQN and curriculum learning essential for convergence.

Conclusion: Results highlight win-rate limitations in sports simulations, showing defensive bias and need for better reward design for realistic reinforcement learning in tennis.

Abstract: Tennis strategy optimization is a challenging sequential decision-making problem involving hierarchical scoring, stochastic outcomes, long-horizon credit assignment, physical fatigue, and adaptation to opponent skill. I present a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a custom tennis simulation environment with a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network(DDQN) trained using curriculum learning. The environment models complete tennis scoring at the level of points, games, and sets, rally-level tactical decisions across ten discrete action categories, symmetric fatigue dynamics, and a continuous opponent skill parameter. The dueling architecture decomposes action-value estimation into state-value and advantage components, while double Q-learning reduces overestimation bias and improves training stability in this long-horizon stochastic domain. Curriculum learning progressively increases opponent difficulty from 0.40 to 0.50, enabling robust skill acquisition without the training collapse observed under fixed opponents. Across extensive evaluations, the trained agent achieves win rates between 98 and 100 percent against balanced opponents and maintains strong performance against more challenging opponents. Serve efficiency ranges from 63.0 to 67.5 percent, and return efficiency ranges from 52.8 to 57.1 percent. Ablation studies demonstrate that both the dueling architecture and curriculum learning are necessary for stable convergence, while a standard DQN baseline fails to learn effective policies. Despite strong performance, tactical analysis reveals a pronounced defensive bias, with the learned policy prioritizing error avoidance and prolonged rallies over aggressive point construction. These results highlight a limitation of win-rate driven optimization in simplified sports simulations and emphasize the importance of reward design for realistic sports reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: KernelEvolve effectively addresses heterogeneity challenges, reducing development time from weeks to hours, improving performance over baselines, and lowering the programmability barrier for new AI hardware through automated kernel generation, enhancing scalability and efficiency in DLRM systems.

Abstract: Making deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) training and inference fast and efficient is important. However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.

### [59] [The Law of Multi-Model Collaboration: Scaling Limits of Model Ensembling for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23340)
*Dakuan Lu,Jiaqi Zhang,Cheng Yuan,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts performance limits of LLM ensembles based on aggregated parameter budget, showing multi-model systems scale better than single models, with model diversity driving gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded, so collaboration among multiple LLMs through techniques like model routing and ensembling can surpass individual performance, but lacks a unifying theoretical framework for performance scaling.

Method: Adopt a method-agnostic formulation with an idealized integration oracle where cross-entropy loss per sample is determined by the minimum loss from any model in the pool, quantifying the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration.

Result: Multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with total parameter count, showing greater improvement and lower theoretical loss floor than single models; ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better scaling than homogeneous ones.

Conclusion: Model collaboration is a critical axis for extending LLM intelligence frontier, with model diversity as a primary driver of collaboration gains, suggesting future advances in multi-model integration.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been largely driven by scaling laws for individual models, which predict performance improvements as model parameters and data volume increase. However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains. These findings suggest that model collaboration represents a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs.

### [61] [Frequency Regularization: Unveiling the Spectral Inductive Bias of Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22192)
*Jiahao Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how regularization techniques like L2 regularization and Dropout affect the frequency selection in CNNs, introducing a framework and metric to show they bias networks toward low-frequency features, revealing a trade-off between accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regularization techniques are widely used in deep learning, but their physical mechanisms for selecting feature frequencies are not well understood, prompting an investigation into the spectral bias of CNNs.

Method: The authors develop a Visual Diagnostic Framework to track weight frequency evolution during training and propose the Spectral Suppression Ratio (SSR) to measure low-pass filtering effects, addressing aliasing in small kernels via discrete radial profiling, with experiments on ResNet-18 and CIFAR-10.

Result: L2 regularization suppresses high-frequency energy accumulation by over 3x compared to unregularized baselines, and it shows an accuracy-robustness trade-off, being sensitive to broadband Gaussian noise but superior against high-frequency information loss, outperforming baselines by >6% in blurred scenarios.

Conclusion: Regularization imposes a strong spectral inductive bias toward low-frequency structures in CNNs, providing a signal-processing perspective on generalization and highlighting trade-offs in model robustness.

Abstract: Regularization techniques such as L2 regularization (Weight Decay) and Dropout are fundamental to training deep neural networks, yet their underlying physical mechanisms regarding feature frequency selection remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the Spectral Bias of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We introduce a Visual Diagnostic Framework to track the dynamic evolution of weight frequencies during training and propose a novel metric, the Spectral Suppression Ratio (SSR), to quantify the "low-pass filtering" intensity of different regularizers. By addressing the aliasing issue in small kernels (e.g., 3x3) through discrete radial profiling, our empirical results on ResNet-18 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that L2 regularization suppresses high-frequency energy accumulation by over 3x compared to unregularized baselines. Furthermore, we reveal a critical Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off: while L2 models are sensitive to broadband Gaussian noise due to over-specialization in low frequencies, they exhibit superior robustness against high-frequency information loss (e.g., low resolution), outperforming baselines by >6% in blurred scenarios. This work provides a signal-processing perspective on generalization, confirming that regularization enforces a strong spectral inductive bias towards low-frequency structures.

### [62] [Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS): A Homeostatic Framework for Adaptive Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22200)
*Dhruv Tiwari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS) as a bio-inspired internal feedback engine to enhance robustness in AI agents by dynamically modulating optimization landscapes using continuous appraisal signals like Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI methods rely on static, extrinsic reward functions, leading to fragility in open-ended environments, poor exploration, difficulty adapting to non-stationarity, and extensive manual tuning.

Method: Introduce EILS framework that models emotions as continuous, homeostatic appraisal signals derived from interaction history; formalize them as vector-valued internal states to dynamically regulate entropy, plasticity, and trust regions.

Result: Hypothesized that EILS agents will outperform standard baselines in sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation through closed-loop homeostatic regulation, though empirical results are not stated in the abstract.

Conclusion: EILS offers a coherent, bio-inspired alternative to scattered heuristics, potentially enabling more robust and autonomous agents in real-world settings by internalizing emotion-like control mechanisms.

Abstract: The ruling method in modern Artificial Intelligence spanning from Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) relies on a surge of static, externally defined reward functions. While this "extrinsic maximization" approach has rendered superhuman performance in closed, stationary fields, it produces agents that are fragile in open-ended, real-world environments. Standard agents lack internal autonomy: they struggle to explore without dense feedback, fail to adapt to distribution shifts (non-stationarity), and require extensive manual tuning of static hyperparameters. This paper proposes that the unaddressed factor in robust autonomy is a functional analog to biological emotion, serving as a high-level homeostatic control mechanism. We introduce Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a unified framework that replaces scattered optimization heuristics with a coherent, bio-inspired internal feedback engine. Unlike traditional methods that treat emotions as semantic labels, EILS models them as continuous, homeostatic appraisal signals such as Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence. We formalize these signals as vector-valued internal states derived from interaction history. These states dynamically modulate the agent's optimization landscape in real time: curiosity regulates entropy to prevent mode collapse, stress modulates plasticity to overcome inactivity, and confidence adapts trust regions to stabilize convergence. We hypothesize that this closed-loop homeostatic regulation can enable EILS agents to outperform standard baselines in terms of sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation.

### [63] [Transformer Reconstructed with Dynamic Value Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22212)
*Xiaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a single-head Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) to replace multi-head attention in transformers, reducing complexity and saving training time while improving learning capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The static value per query in transformer heads is an intrinsic limitation; multi-head attention mitigates this but is constrained by complexity due to fixed heads. The goal is to design a method for dynamic value assignment per query to eliminate redundant heads and simplify the model.

Method: Introduces a method to dynamically determine a value for each query, allowing a single head to function effectively, which eliminates the need for multiple heads and the following feed-forward network as embeddings fetch sufficient contextual values.

Result: DVA reduces training time by 37.6% compared to the original transformer, while enhancing learning capability, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness in replacing multi-head attention.

Conclusion: A single-head DVA is sufficient for transformer architectures, offering significant time savings and improved performance by addressing the static value limitation, outperforming the standard multi-head approach.

Abstract: Since transformer was firstly published in 2017, several works have been proposed to optimize it. However, the major structure of transformer remains unchanged, ignoring one of its main intrinsic limitations, which is the same static value is used for every query in a head. Transformer itself tries to solve this problem by implementing multi-head attentions, yet the number of heads is limited by complexity. I propose a method to decide a value for each query dynamically, which could cut down all the redundant heads, keeping only one. Consequently, the following feed forward network could be cut down entirely, as each revised embedding has already fetched enough useful values far beyond the context. As a result, a single-head Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) is all you need in a transformer. According to the experiment, DVA may save 37.6% training time than the original transformer meanwhile increasing the learning capability.

### [64] [On the Existence and Behaviour of Secondary Attention Sinks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22213)
*Jeffrey T. H. Wong,Cheng Zhang,Louis Mahon,Wayne Luk,Anton Isopoussu,Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a new class of attention sinks called secondary sinks, which differ from primary sinks (like BOS tokens) in their formation, persistence, and impact in middle layers of transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on attention sinks has focused on tokens like the BOS token that draw high attention uniformly across layers, but the discovery of other sink tokens with different properties suggests a more complex phenomenon requiring further analysis.

Method: Conducted extensive experiments across 11 model families to analyze the appearance, properties, formation, and impact of secondary sinks, including their emergence in middle layers via specific MLP modules.

Result: Secondary sinks are formed by middle-layer MLPs aligning token representations with primary sinks, their strength (measured by l2-norm) determines sink score and persistence, and primary sinks weaken in middle layers as secondary sinks emerge. Sink levels become more deterministic in larger models (e.g., three in QwQ-32B, six in Qwen3-14B).

Conclusion: Secondary sinks represent a distinct and common pattern in attention mechanisms, offering insights into the dynamics of attention in transformer models, especially in larger-scale architectures.

Abstract: Attention sinks are tokens, often the beginning-of-sequence (BOS) token, that receive disproportionately high attention despite limited semantic relevance. In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B.

### [65] [Interpretable and Adaptive Node Classification on Heterophilic Graphs via Combinatorial Scoring and Hybrid Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22221)
*Soroush Vahidi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable and adaptive framework for semi-supervised node classification using combinatorial inference instead of deep message passing, with optional neural refinement based on validation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks (GNNs) work well on homophilic graphs but struggle under heterophily; there's a need for a method that combines interpretability, adaptability, and performance across different graph types.

Method: Assigns labels via a confidence-ordered greedy procedure with an additive scoring function integrating class priors, neighborhood statistics, feature similarity, and label-label compatibility; uses a validation-gated hybrid strategy to optionally inject combinatorial predictions into a lightweight neural model.

Result: Experiments show competitive performance with modern GNNs on heterophilic and transitional benchmarks, while offering advantages in interpretability, tunability, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective alternative to GNNs for node classification, particularly under heterophily, by blending combinatorial inference with adaptive neural refinement to maintain interpretability and adaptivity without data leakage.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance on homophilic graphs but often struggle under heterophily, where adjacent nodes frequently belong to different classes. We propose an interpretable and adaptive framework for semi-supervised node classification based on explicit combinatorial inference rather than deep message passing. Our method assigns labels using a confidence-ordered greedy procedure driven by an additive scoring function that integrates class priors, neighborhood statistics, feature similarity, and training-derived label-label compatibility. A small set of transparent hyperparameters controls the relative influence of these components, enabling smooth adaptation between homophilic and heterophilic regimes.
  We further introduce a validation-gated hybrid strategy in which combinatorial predictions are optionally injected as priors into a lightweight neural model. Hybrid refinement is applied only when it improves validation performance, preserving interpretability when neuralization is unnecessary. All adaptation signals are computed strictly from training data, ensuring a leakage-free evaluation protocol. Experiments on heterophilic and transitional benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance with modern GNNs while offering advantages in interpretability, tunability, and computational efficiency.

### [66] [Müntz-Szász Networks: Neural Architectures with Learnable Power-Law Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22222)
*Gnankan Landry Regis N'guessan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Standard neural network architectures employ fixed activation functions (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid) that are poorly suited for approximating functions with singular or fractional power behavior, a structure that arises ubiquitously in physics, including boundary layers, fracture mechanics, and corner singularities. We introduce Müntz-Szász Networks (MSN), a novel architecture that replaces fixed smooth activations with learnable fractional power bases grounded in classical approximation theory. Each MSN edge computes $φ(x) = \sum_k a_k |x|^{μ_k} + \sum_k b_k \mathrm{sign}(x)|x|^{λ_k}$, where the exponents $\{μ_k, λ_k\}$ are learned alongside the coefficients. We prove that MSN inherits universal approximation from the Müntz-Szász theorem and establish novel approximation rates: for functions of the form $|x|^α$, MSN achieves error $\mathcal{O}(|μ- α|^2)$ with a single learned exponent, whereas standard MLPs require $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-1/α})$ neurons for comparable accuracy. On supervised regression with singular target functions, MSN achieves 5-8x lower error than MLPs with 10x fewer parameters. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a particularly demanding application for singular function approximation; on PINN benchmarks including a singular ODE and stiff boundary-layer problems, MSN achieves 3-6x improvement while learning interpretable exponents that match the known solution structure. Our results demonstrate that theory-guided architectural design can yield dramatic improvements for scientifically-motivated function classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional network traffic analysis systems often have high false positives and lack interpretability, limiting analyst trust.

Method: ReGAIN creates natural-language summaries from network traffic, embeds them into a multi-collection vector database, and uses a hierarchical retrieval pipeline with metadata-based filtering, MMR sampling, cross-encoder reranking, and an abstention mechanism.

Result: Evaluated on ICMP ping flood and TCP SYN flood traces from real-world traffic, it achieves accuracy between 95.95% and 98.82%, validated against dataset ground truth and human expert assessments.

Conclusion: ReGAIN outperforms rule-based, classical ML, and deep learning baselines by providing transparent, trustworthy, and verifiable responses for robust network traffic analysis.

Abstract: Modern networks generate vast, heterogeneous traffic that must be continuously analyzed for security and performance. Traditional network traffic analysis systems, whether rule-based or machine learning-driven, often suffer from high false positives and lack interpretability, limiting analyst trust. In this paper, we present ReGAIN, a multi-stage framework that combines traffic summarization, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for transparent and accurate network traffic analysis. ReGAIN creates natural-language summaries from network traffic, embeds them into a multi-collection vector database, and utilizes a hierarchical retrieval pipeline to ground LLM responses with evidence citations. The pipeline features metadata-based filtering, MMR sampling, a two-stage cross-encoder reranking mechanism, and an abstention mechanism to reduce hallucinations and ensure grounded reasoning. Evaluated on ICMP ping flood and TCP SYN flood traces from the real-world traffic dataset, it demonstrates robust performance, achieving accuracy between 95.95% and 98.82% across different attack types and evaluation benchmarks. These results are validated against two complementary sources: dataset ground truth and human expert assessments. ReGAIN also outperforms rule-based, classical ML, and deep learning baselines while providing unique explainability through trustworthy, verifiable responses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiRL is an efficient post-training framework for diffusion language models (dLLMs) integrating FlexAttention blockwise training and LMDeploy-optimized inference, enabling a two-stage approach with DiPO for math tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) show promise but have underdeveloped post-training, suffering from computational inefficiency and mismatched training-inference objectives, limiting performance on complex reasoning like mathematics.

Method: Introduces DiRL, a framework combining FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference for efficient online updates, supporting two-stage post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning), and proposes DiPO, an unbiased Group Relative Policy Optimization tailored for dLLMs.

Result: DiRL-8B-Instruct trained on high-quality math data achieves state-of-the-art math performance among dLLMs and surpasses comparable Qwen2.5 series models on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiRL effectively addresses efficiency and performance gaps in dLLM post-training, showcasing strong potential for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to Auto-Regressive (AR) models. While recent efforts have validated their pre-training potential and accelerated inference speeds, the post-training landscape for dLLMs remains underdeveloped. Existing methods suffer from computational inefficiency and objective mismatches between training and inference, severely limiting performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics. To address this, we introduce DiRL, an efficient post-training framework that tightly integrates FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference. This architecture enables a streamlined online model update loop, facilitating efficient two-stage post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning). Building on this framework, we propose DiPO, the first unbiased Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation tailored for dLLMs. We validate our approach by training DiRL-8B-Instruct on high-quality math data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art math performance among dLLMs and surpasses comparable models in the Qwen2.5 series on several benchmarks.

### [69] [Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22238)
*Byung-Kwan Lee,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Ryo Hachiuma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student) is a mask-progressive reinforcement learning framework designed to efficiently distill knowledge from large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) into compact students by masking non-dominant teacher weights, progressively restoring capacity, and using offline RL with accuracy and distillation rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale VLMs face deployment challenges on mobile or edge devices due to their massive size, creating a need for compact yet capable models. Knowledge distillation from large teachers to small students often leads to unstable learning and performance degradation due to the significant size gap and inability of students to replicate complex teacher representations.

Method: The Masters framework uses mask-progressive RL distillation: it masks non-dominant teacher weights to reduce complexity, then gradually restores the teacher's capacity during training for smoother learning. An offline RL stage incorporates accuracy rewards (for response correctness) and distillation rewards (for ease of teacher-to-student knowledge transfer), leveraging pre-generated responses from masked teachers to avoid the computational cost of online think-answer RL.

Result: The method allows students to efficiently learn richer, stable representations from teachers, overcoming the limitations of traditional distillation by mitigating instability and enabling compact VLMs to achieve strong performance without extensive computational resources.

Conclusion: Masters provides an effective approach for distilling knowledge from large VLMs into smaller models, facilitating practical deployment on mobile or edge devices through stable, progressive learning and efficient offline reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have recently achieved remarkable multimodal understanding, but their massive size makes them impractical for deployment on mobile or edge devices. This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process.

### [70] [EvoXplain: When Machine Learning Models Agree on Predictions but Disagree on Why -- Measuring Mechanistic Multiplicity Across Training Runs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22240)
*Chama Bensmail*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoXplain is a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training, revealing that high-accuracy models can rely on different internal mechanisms, leading to explanatory multimodality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the assumption that high-accuracy models have correct and trustworthy explanations, raising the question of whether models achieving similar performance rely on the same logic or competing mechanisms. It highlights the oversight of explanatory stability in machine learning.

Method: EvoXplain treats explanations as samples from the stochastic optimization process without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles. It evaluates stability using the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets with Logistic Regression and Random Forests, analyzing whether explanations form a single coherent mode or multiple distinct ones.

Result: The study finds that despite high predictive accuracy, explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality, with models like Logistic Regression producing multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. Differences are not attributed to hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated instantiation, making explanatory instability visible and quantifiable, and cautioning that single-instance or averaged explanations may obscure multiple underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Machine learning models are primarily judged by predictive performance, especially in applied settings. Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory instability visible and quantifiable, revealing when single-instance or averaged explanations obscure the existence of multiple underlying mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate bead geometry prediction in L-DED is hindered by scarcity and heterogeneity of experimental datasets from different materials, machine settings, and parameters, limiting generalization and practical application.

Method: Proposes a cross-dataset knowledge transfer model using meta-learning (MAML and Reptile algorithms) to enable rapid adaptation to new deposition conditions with limited data, trained and evaluated on multiple experimental datasets from literature and in-house experiments across various L-DED processes.

Result: Both MAML and Reptile achieve accurate bead height predictions on unseen target tasks with as few as 3-9 training examples, outperforming conventional feedforward neural networks, with R-squared up to ~0.9 and MAE of 0.03-0.08 mm.

Conclusion: The meta-learning framework effectively transfers knowledge across heterogeneous L-DED settings, demonstrating strong generalization and practical utility for bead geometry prediction in additive manufacturing with limited data availability.

Abstract: Accurate bead geometry prediction in laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) is often hindered by the scarcity and heterogeneity of experimental datasets collected under different materials, machine configurations, and process parameters. To address this challenge, a cross-dataset knowledge transfer model based on meta-learning for predicting deposited track geometry in L-DED is proposed. Specifically, two gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, i.e., Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Reptile, are investigated to enable rapid adaptation to new deposition conditions with limited data. The proposed framework is performed using multiple experimental datasets compiled from peer-reviewed literature and in-house experiments and evaluated across powder-fed, wire-fed, and hybrid wire-powder L-DED processes. Results show that both MAML and Reptile achieve accurate bead height predictions on unseen target tasks using as few as three to nine training examples, consistently outperforming conventional feedforward neural networks trained under comparable data constraints. Across multiple target tasks representing different printing conditions, the meta-learning models achieve strong generalization performance, with R-squared values reaching up to approximately 0.9 and mean absolute errors between 0.03-0.08 mm, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer across heterogeneous L-DED settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study evaluated fairness of lung cancer risk AI models finding significant demographic disparities: Sybil performed better in women vs men, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black vs White participants - not explained by clinical factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung cancer screening with low-dose CT can reduce deaths but strains radiology resources. AI models show potential for risk estimation, but their performance across diverse high-risk populations remains unclear. The study aims to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in lung cancer risk models using an ethical framework.

Method: The study used the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models (Sybil lung cancer risk model and Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator) and the PanCan2b logistic regression model. All models were trained on NLST data and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. Performance metrics (AUROC, sensitivity, specificity) were evaluated across demographic subgroups and potential confounding from clinical risk factors was explored.

Result: Sybil showed statistically significant AUROC difference between women (0.88) and men (0.81, p < .001). Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black participants (0.39) than White participants (0.69) at 90% specificity. These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and may represent unfair biases.

Conclusion: The study concludes that significant demographic performance disparities exist in deep learning lung cancer risk models that are not explained by clinical confounders, suggesting unfair biases according to the JustEFAB framework. This highlights the need for improving model performance across underrepresented subgroups, monitoring for algorithmic fairness, and further research in this area.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in adults worldwide. Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001). At 90% specificity, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.59) than White participants (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.73). These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB. Our findings highlight the importance of improving and monitoring model performance across underrepresented subgroups, and further research on algorithmic fairness, in lung cancer screening.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a machine learning framework using neural networks and transfer learning to predict mycotoxin contamination in oats, identifying key environmental predictors for early intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mycotoxin contamination threatens crop quality and safety, necessitating accurate prediction models for early interventions to reduce economic losses in agriculture.

Method: Five modeling approaches, including MLP, MLP with pre-training, and transfer learning models TabPFN, TabNet, and FT-Transformer, were evaluated on Irish oat data using regression and classification metrics with permutation-based variable importance analysis.

Result: TabPFN achieved the best overall performance in predicting mycotoxin levels, with weather patterns in the 90-day pre-harvest period and seed moisture content identified as the most influential predictors.

Conclusion: Transfer learning, particularly TabPFN, offers an effective method for mycotoxin prediction in oats, emphasizing the critical role of pre-harvest weather and seed conditions in managing contamination risks.

Abstract: Mycotoxin contamination poses a significant risk to cereal crop quality, food safety, and agricultural productivity. Accurate prediction of mycotoxin levels can support early intervention strategies and reduce economic losses. This study investigates the use of neural networks and transfer learning models to predict mycotoxin contamination in Irish oat crops as a multi-response prediction task. Our dataset comprises oat samples collected in Ireland, containing a mix of environmental, agronomic, and geographical predictors. Five modelling approaches were evaluated: a baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP), an MLP with pre-training, and three transfer learning models; TabPFN, TabNet, and FT-Transformer. Model performance was evaluated using regression (RMSE, $R^2$) and classification (AUC, F1) metrics, with results reported per toxin and on average. Additionally, permutation-based variable importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential predictors across both prediction tasks. The transfer learning approach TabPFN provided the overall best performance, followed by the baseline MLP. Our variable importance analysis revealed that weather history patterns in the 90-day pre-harvest period were the most important predictors, alongside seed moisture content.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Linear probes trained with Brier score loss provide calibrated uncertainty estimates for LLM judges using hidden states, reducing computational cost by ~10x compared to existing methods, though conservative estimates may perform worse on easy datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-based judges are widely used in applications, efficient and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are crucial for production deployment. Current methods like verbalized confidence or multi-generation are either poorly calibrated or computationally expensive.

Method: The paper introduces linear probes trained with a Brier score-based loss to estimate uncertainty from reasoning judges' hidden states, requiring no additional model training. It is evaluated on both objective tasks (reasoning, math, factuality, coding) and subjective human preference judgments.

Result: Probes achieve superior calibration compared to existing methods, saving ~10x in computation, generalize robustly to unseen evaluation domains, and provide higher accuracy on high-confidence predictions. However, conservative estimates underperform on easier datasets.

Conclusion: Interpretability-based uncertainty estimation with probes offers a practical, scalable plug-and-play solution for LLM judges in production, especially valuable for safety-critical deployments prioritizing low false-positive rates, despite some limitations on easy tasks.

Abstract: As LLM-based judges become integral to industry applications, obtaining well-calibrated uncertainty estimates efficiently has become critical for production deployment. However, existing techniques, such as verbalized confidence and multi-generation methods, are often either poorly calibrated or computationally expensive. We introduce linear probes trained with a Brier score-based loss to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates from reasoning judges' hidden states, requiring no additional model training. We evaluate our approach on both objective tasks (reasoning, mathematics, factuality, coding) and subjective human preference judgments. Our results demonstrate that probes achieve superior calibration compared to existing methods with $\approx10$x computational savings, generalize robustly to unseen evaluation domains, and deliver higher accuracy on high-confidence predictions. However, probes produce conservative estimates that underperform on easier datasets but may benefit safety-critical deployments prioritizing low false-positive rates. Overall, our work demonstrates that interpretability-based uncertainty estimation provides a practical and scalable plug-and-play solution for LLM judges in production.

### [75] [The Affine Divergence: Aligning Activation Updates Beyond Normalisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22247)
*George Bird*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes optimization mismatches in gradient descent, proposes normalisation based on activation updates, introduces PatchNorm for convolutions, and questions the traditional affine+nonlinear modeling approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a systematic mismatch between ideal theoretical updates and practical activation updates in gradient descent during neural network training, as activation updates are crucial due to their proximity to the loss but not optimized for steepest descent.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze the scaling issues in activation updates across affine, convolutional, and attention layers. They propose trivial corrections that lead to normalisation principles, introduce PatchNorm as a compositional normaliser for convolutions, and suggest decomposing normalisers as activation-function-like maps for improved optimization.

Result: The proposed solutions, including normalised updates derived from first principles, outperform conventional normalisers in empirical tests. PatchNorm is validated as effective for convolutional networks, providing an alternative framework to current practices.

Conclusion: This work reframes normalisation mechanics, introduces novel functions like PatchNorm, challenges the standard affine+nonlinear model design, and encourages a more principled theoretical approach to prioritising representations in neural network optimization.

Abstract: A systematic mismatch exists between mathematically ideal and effective activation updates during gradient descent. As intended, parameters update in their direction of steepest descent. However, activations are argued to constitute a more directly impactful quantity to prioritise in optimisation, as they are closer to the loss in the computational graph and carry sample-dependent information through the network. Yet their propagated updates do not take the optimal steepest-descent step. These quantities exhibit non-ideal sample-wise scaling across affine, convolutional, and attention layers. Solutions to correct for this are trivial and, entirely incidentally, derive normalisation from first principles despite motivational independence. Consequently, such considerations offer a fresh and conceptual reframe of normalisation's action, with auxiliary experiments bolstering this mechanistically. Moreover, this analysis makes clear a second possibility: a solution that is functionally distinct from modern normalisations, without scale-invariance, yet remains empirically successful, outperforming conventional normalisers across several tests. This is presented as an alternative to the affine map. This generalises to convolution via a new functional form, "PatchNorm", a compositionally inseparable normaliser. Together, these provide an alternative mechanistic framework that adds to, and counters some of, the discussion of normalisation. Further, it is argued that normalisers are better decomposed into activation-function-like maps with parameterised scaling, thereby aiding the prioritisation of representations during optimisation. Overall, this constitutes a theoretical-principled approach that yields several new functions that are empirically validated and raises questions about the affine + nonlinear approach to model creation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method uses neural networks trained on synthetic flight data to predict aerodynamic parameters for model rockets from a single real apogee measurement, achieving accurate results without real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for predicting model rocket flight performance rely on CFD or empirical data, which are costly and time-consuming, lacking efficient data-driven approaches without extensive real flight data.

Method: Simulation-based amortized inference with a neural network trained on synthetic flight data from a physics simulator, predicting drag coefficient and thrust correction from apogee and motor/configuration features.

Result: On 8 real flights, the method achieved a mean absolute error of 12.3 m in apogee prediction, reducing error compared to OpenRocket baselines, with systematic bias highlighting physics-world gaps.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective sim-to-real transfer for aerodynamic parameter prediction with zero real training data, offering potential applications in rocketry.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of model rocket flight performance requires estimating aerodynamic parameters that are difficult to measure directly. Traditional approaches rely on computational fluid dynamics or empirical correlations, while data-driven methods require extensive real flight data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. We present a simulation-based amortized inference approach that trains a neural network on synthetic flight data generated from a physics simulator, then applies the learned model to real flights without any fine-tuning. Our method learns to invert the forward physics model, directly predicting drag coefficient and thrust correction factor from a single apogee measurement combined with motor and configuration features. In this proof-of-concept study, we train on 10,000 synthetic flights and evaluate on 8 real flights, achieving a mean absolute error of 12.3 m in apogee prediction - demonstrating promising sim-to-real transfer with zero real training examples. Analysis reveals a systematic positive bias in predictions, providing quantitative insight into the gap between idealized physics and real-world flight conditions. We additionally compare against OpenRocket baseline predictions, showing that our learned approach reduces apogee prediction error. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and adoption in the amateur rocketry community.

*Zheng Xing,Weibing Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using temporal vision semantics (TVS) from human motion sequences via LLM to enhance unsupervised human motion segmentation (HMS) through improved subspace clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subspace clustering methods for HMS overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration, limiting performance by not leveraging temporal semantics in motion sequences.

Method: Extract textual motion information from consecutive frames using LLM, determine if frames depict the same motion to learn temporal neighboring information, integrate TVS into subspace clustering with temporal regularizers and constraints, and introduce a feedback-enabled framework for continuous optimization.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets in experiments.

Conclusion: Incorporating TVS via LLM into subspace clustering effectively improves HMS by addressing temporal semantic exploration, offering a robust feedback-enabled approach.

Abstract: Unsupervised human motion segmentation (HMS) can be effectively achieved using subspace clustering techniques. However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets.

*Pascal Passigan,Kevin zhu,Angelina Ning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using a merged biomedical knowledge graph and graph attention network to predict gene expression changes from drug-cell interactions, improving over baselines and highlighting the value of knowledge graph edges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior deep learning models integrated multimodal embeddings into biomedical knowledge graphs but focused on tasks like link prediction or binary drug-disease associations, not gene perturbation analysis which reveals mechanistic transcriptomic effects.

Method: Construct a merged biomedical graph combining PrimeKG++ with LINCS L1000 drug and cell line nodes using multimodal embeddings from models like MolFormerXL and BioBERT. Train a graph attention network with a downstream prediction head to learn delta expression profiles for drug-cell pairs.

Result: The framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes under scaffold and random splits. Ablation experiments show that edges from biomedical knowledge graphs enhance perturbation-level prediction.

Conclusion: This framework advances mechanistic drug modeling by shifting from binary associations to granular transcriptional effects, offering insights for drug mechanisms, off-target predictions, and repurposing opportunities.

Abstract: Understanding how small molecules perturb gene expression is essential for uncovering drug mechanisms, predicting off-target effects, and identifying repurposing opportunities. While prior deep learning frameworks have integrated multimodal embeddings into biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) and further improved these representations through graph neural network message-passing paradigms, these models have been applied to tasks such as link prediction and binary drug-disease association, rather than the task of gene perturbation, which may unveil more about mechanistic transcriptomic effects. To address this gap, we construct a merged biomedical graph that integrates (i) PrimeKG++, an augmentation of PrimeKG containing semantically rich embeddings for nodes with (ii) LINCS L1000 drug and cell line nodes, initialized with multimodal embeddings from foundation models such as MolFormerXL and BioBERT. Using this heterogeneous graph, we train a graph attention network (GAT) with a downstream prediction head that learns the delta expression profile of over 978 landmark genes for a given drug-cell pair. Our results show that our framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes (DEG) -- which predict the delta expression given a concatenated embedding of drug features, target features, and baseline cell expression -- under the scaffold and random splits. Ablation experiments with edge shuffling and node feature randomization further demonstrate that the edges provided by biomedical KGs enhance perturbation-level prediction. More broadly, our framework provides a path toward mechanistic drug modeling: moving beyond binary drug-disease association tasks to granular transcriptional effects of therapeutic intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN methods for link prediction struggle with large-scale sparse graphs and transfer learning alignment. Self-supervised methods have overlooked transfer learning potential across different graph datasets.

Method: Proposes GAATNet with two strategies: 1) incorporate distant neighbor embeddings as biases in self-attention for global features, 2) introduce a lightweight self-adapter module during fine-tuning for efficiency.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets show GAATNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks.

Conclusion: GAATNet provides a general and scalable solution for effectively integrating GNNs with transfer learning in link prediction, with publicly available source code and datasets.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have brought revolutionary advancements to the field of link prediction (LP), providing powerful tools for mining potential relationships in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when dealing with large-scale sparse graphs and the need for a high degree of alignment between different datasets in transfer learning. Besides, although self-supervised methods have achieved remarkable success in many graph tasks, prior research has overlooked the potential of transfer learning to generalize across different graph datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Graph Attention Adaptive Transfer Network (GAATNet). It combines the advantages of pre-training and fine-tuning to capture global node embedding information across datasets of different scales, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer and improved LP performance. To enhance the model's generalization ability and accelerate training, we design two key strategies: 1) Incorporate distant neighbor embeddings as biases in the self-attention module to capture global features. 2) Introduce a lightweight self-adapter module during fine-tuning to improve training efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that GAATNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in LP tasks. This study provides a general and scalable solution for LP tasks to effectively integrate GNNs with transfer learning.

*Daniil Burakov,Ivan Petrov,Dmitrii Khelimskii,Ivan Bessonov,Mikhail Lazarev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study develops a machine learning model using real and synthetic data to predict cardiac death risk after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), showing that data augmentation improves minority-class detection and identifies key influential features like Age and Ejection Fraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting long-term outcomes after PCI is critical, but imbalanced data often leads models to overlook minority cases, necessitating better methods for risk assessment.

Method: The researchers analyzed 2,044 PCI patients with bifurcation lesions, applied machine learning models, generated 500 synthetic samples to address class imbalance, and used permutation feature importance to identify key factors affecting mortality.

Result: Models without augmentation achieved high accuracy (0.92-0.93) but ignored the minority class; augmentation increased minority-class recall, improved probability quality, and identified Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease as the most influential features.

Conclusion: Data augmentation with realistic synthetic cases effectively reduces brittleness in imbalanced clinical predictions, and the study advocates for routine reporting of probability quality and stress tests alongside standard metrics to enhance model reliability.

Abstract: Patient status, angiographic and procedural characteristics encode crucial signals for predicting long-term outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The aim of the study was to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiac death based on the real and synthetic data of patients undergoing PCI and to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on mortality. We analyzed 2,044 patients, who underwent a PCI for bifurcation lesions. The primary outcome was cardiac death at 3-year follow-up. Several machine learning models were applied to predict three-year mortality after PCI. To address class imbalance and improve the representation of the minority class, an additional 500 synthetic samples were generated and added to the training set. To evaluate the contribution of individual features to model performance, we applied permutation feature importance. An additional experiment was conducted to evaluate how the model's predictions would change after removing non-informative features from the training and test datasets. Without oversampling, all models achieve high overall accuracy (0.92-0.93), yet they almost completely ignore the minority class. Across models, augmentation consistently increases minority-class recall with minimal loss of AUROC, improves probability quality, and yields more clinically reasonable risk estimates on the constructed severe profiles. According to feature importance analysis, four features emerged as the most influential: Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease. These results show that straightforward augmentation with realistic and extreme cases can expose, quantify, and reduce brittleness in imbalanced clinical prediction using only tabular records, and motivate routine reporting of probability quality and stress tests alongside headline metrics.

*Rahul D Ray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator, revealing that explicit energy conservation enforcement is redundant when equations are physically consistent, while removing Fabry-Perot oscillations significantly improves data variability and downstream machine learning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In scientific domains where real data are scarce, physics-constrained data generation is crucial, but existing approaches can over-constrain models without identifying necessary physical components. The study aims to systematically investigate which constraints are essential by conducting an ablation study.

Method: The authors perform a systematic ablation study on a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator that maps five geometric parameters to 100-point spectral responses. They selectively remove components such as explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise.

Result: Key findings include: explicit energy conservation enforcement is mathematically redundant (mean error ~7e-9), Fabry-Perot oscillations dominate bandwidth variability (72% reduction in half-maximum bandwidth spread when removed), and standard noise-addition pipelines introduce unphysical negative absorption values. The generator operates at 200 samples/sec, much faster than full-wave solvers.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable guidance for physics-informed dataset design, showing that removing certain constraints like Fabry-Perot oscillations improves machine learning performance (e.g., 31.3% better R-squared for bandwidth prediction). It highlights machine learning metrics as diagnostic tools for assessing constraint relevance.

Abstract: Physics-constrained data generation is essential for machine learning in scientific domains where real data are scarce; however, existing approaches often over-constrain models without identifying which physical components are necessary. We present a systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator that maps five geometric parameters to 100-point spectral responses. By selectively removing explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise, we uncover a physics constraint paradox: explicit energy conservation enforcement is mathematically redundant when the underlying equations are physically consistent, with constrained and unconstrained variants achieving identical conservation accuracy (mean error approximately 7 x 10^-9). In contrast, Fabry-Perot oscillations dominate threshold-based bandwidth variability, accounting for a 72 percent reduction in half-maximum bandwidth spread when removed (with bandwidth spread reduced from 132.3 nm to 37.4 nm). We further identify a subtle pitfall: standard noise-addition-plus-renormalization pipelines introduce 0.5 percent unphysical negative absorption values. The generator operates at 200 samples per second, enabling high-throughput data generation and remaining orders of magnitude faster than typical full-wave solvers reported in the literature. Finally, downstream machine learning evaluation reveals a clear physics-learnability trade-off: while central wavelength prediction remains unaffected, removing Fabry-Perot oscillations improves bandwidth prediction accuracy by 31.3 percent in R-squared and reduces RMSE by 73.8 percent. These findings provide actionable guidance for physics-informed dataset design and highlight machine learning performance as a diagnostic tool for assessing constraint relevance.

Result: A comprehensive benchmark, LLMTM, is proposed, testing six tasks across nine temporal motif types, with findings guiding the development of a tool-augmented LLM agent that solves tasks accurately, though at a high cost.

Conclusion: The proposed structure-aware dispatcher effectively maintains high accuracy while reducing cost, offering a practical solution for efficient temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs.

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated a growing interest in their capacity for processing dynamic graphs. Temporal motifs, as an elementary unit and important local property of dynamic graphs which can directly reflect anomalies and unique phenomena, are essential for understanding their evolutionary dynamics and structural features. However, leveraging LLMs for temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we systematically study LLM performance on temporal motif-related tasks. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, LLMTM (Large Language Models in Temporal Motifs), which includes six tailored tasks across nine temporal motif types. We then conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different prompting techniques and LLMs (including nine models: openPangu-7B, the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and o3) on model performance. Informed by our benchmark findings, we develop a tool-augmented LLM agent that leverages precisely engineered prompts to solve these tasks with high accuracy. Nevertheless, the high accuracy of the agent incurs a substantial cost. To address this trade-off, we propose a simple yet effective structure-aware dispatcher that considers both the dynamic graph's structural properties and the LLM's cognitive load to intelligently dispatch queries between the standard LLM prompting and the more powerful agent. Our experiments demonstrate that the structure-aware dispatcher effectively maintains high accuracy while reducing cost.

*Amgad Ahmed Ali Ibrahim,Hein Htet,Ryoji Asahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical stacking optimization framework (SoDip) using Dirichlet Process and machine learning models improves reproducibility in radiation-induced grafting by addressing variability in polymer film morphology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiation-induced grafting (RIG) for functionalizing polymer films suffers from reproducibility issues due to unreported variability in base-film morphology (e.g., crystallinity, grain orientation, free volume), which affects monomer diffusion, radical distribution, and grafting outcomes, leading to inconsistent performance.

Method: The proposed SoDip framework integrates: (1) a decoder-only Transformer (DeepSeek-R1) to encode textual process descriptors; (2) TabNet and XGBoost for multimodal feature interactions; (3) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) for uncertainty quantification; and (4) Bayesian Optimization for exploring high-dimensional synthesis space, using a curated dataset from ChemDataExtractor 2.0 and WebPlotDigitizer.

Result: In cross-validation, SoDip achieved approximately 33% improvement over GPR alone, provides calibrated confidence intervals to identify low-reproducibility regimes, and outperforms prior models by integrating sparse textual and numerical inputs of varying quality.

Conclusion: SoDip establishes a foundation for reproducible, morphology-aware design in graft polymerization research, addressing key limitations in RIG reproducibility through a data-driven stacking framework.

Abstract: Radiation-induced grafting (RIG) enables precise functionalization of polymer films for ion-exchange membranes, CO2-separation membranes, and battery electrolytes by generating radicals on robust substrates to graft desired monomers. However, reproducibility remains limited due to unreported variability in base-film morphology (crystallinity, grain orientation, free volume), which governs monomer diffusion, radical distribution, and the Trommsdorff effect, leading to spatial graft gradients and performance inconsistencies. We present a hierarchical stacking optimization framework with a Dirichlet's Process (SoDip), a hierarchical data-driven framework integrating: (1) a decoder-only Transformer (DeepSeek-R1) to encode textual process descriptors (irradiation source, grafting type, substrate manufacturer); (2) TabNet and XGBoost for modelling multimodal feature interactions; (3) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) for uncertainty quantification and heteroscedasticity; and (4) Bayesian Optimization for efficient exploration of high-dimensional synthesis space. A diverse dataset was curated using ChemDataExtractor 2.0 and WebPlotDigitizer, incorporating numerical and textual variables across hundreds of RIG studies. In cross-validation, SoDip achieved ~33% improvement over GPR while providing calibrated confidence intervals that identify low-reproducibility regimes. Its stacked architecture integrates sparse textual and numerical inputs of varying quality, outperforming prior models and establishing a foundation for reproducible, morphology-aware design in graft polymerization research.

*Varshith Gudur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Valori introduces a deterministic AI memory substrate using fixed-point arithmetic to ensure bit-identical memory states and search results across hardware, addressing non-determinism in vector embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems' reliance on floating-point arithmetic for vector embeddings introduces non-determinism, causing different memory states and retrieval results across hardware (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This compromises replayability, deployment safety, and auditability in regulated sectors.

Method: Valori replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine to guarantee determinism at the memory boundary.

Result: Valori achieves bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms, addressing non-determinism that arises before indexing or retrieval.

Conclusion: Deterministic memory, as implemented by Valori, is essential for trustworthy AI systems, with an open-source reference available for validation and adoption.

Abstract: Modern AI systems rely on vector embeddings stored and searched using floating-point arithmetic. While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms. We demonstrate that non-determinism arises before indexing or retrieval and show how Valori enforces determinism at the memory boundary. Our results suggest that deterministic memory is a necessary primitive for trustworthy AI systems. The reference implementation is open-source and available at https://github.com/varshith-Git/Valori-Kernel (archived at https://zenodo.org/records/18022660).

*Guokan Chen,Yao Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new PINN variant, DBAW-PIKAN, combines Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with adaptive weighting to solve gradient and spectral bias issues in multi-scale problems, improving accuracy and convergence by over 10x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs face significant challenges with gradient flow stiffness and spectral bias when handling multi-scale or high-frequency problems, which limit their predictive capabilities.

Method: Proposes DBAW-PIKAN, which integrates a Kolmogorov-Arnold network architecture based on learnable B-splines with an adaptive weighting strategy featuring a dynamic decay upper bound.

Result: The method accelerates convergence and improves solution accuracy by at least an order of magnitude compared to baseline models, without extra computational cost, validated on equations like Klein-Gordon, Burgers, and Helmholtz.

Conclusion: DBAW-PIKAN effectively mitigates gradient-related failures and representation bottlenecks in PINNs, enhancing accuracy and generalization for multi-scale physical problems.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have led to significant advancements in scientific computing by integrating fundamental physical principles with advanced data-driven techniques. However, when dealing with problems characterized by multi-scale or high-frequency features, PINNs encounter persistent and severe challenges related to stiffness in gradient flow and spectral bias, which significantly limit their predictive capabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Dynamic Balancing Adaptive Weighting Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (DBAW-PIKAN), designed to mitigate such gradient-related failure modes and overcome the bottlenecks in function representation. The core of DBAW-PIKAN combines the Kolmogorov-Arnold network architecture, based on learnable B-splines, with an adaptive weighting strategy that incorporates a dynamic decay upper bound. Compared to baseline models, the proposed method accelerates the convergence process and improves solution accuracy by at least an order of magnitude without introducing additional computational complexity. A series of numerical benchmarks, including the Klein-Gordon, Burgers, and Helmholtz equations, demonstrate the significant advantages of DBAW-PIKAN in enhancing both accuracy and generalization performance.

*Zikun Guoa,Adeyinka. P. Adedigbaa,Rammohan Mallipeddi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A GAN framework with specialized branches for different appliance types improves synthetic load data generation for energy monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic appliance data is needed for non-intrusive load monitoring and privacy, but existing GAN methods treat all devices uniformly, ignoring differences between intermittent and continuous appliances, leading to unstable training and low fidelity.

Method: Propose Cluster Aggregated GAN framework that routes appliances to specialized branches: clustering module groups activation patterns for intermittent appliances with dedicated generators, and LSTM-based generator for continuous appliances.

Result: Experiments on UVIC smart plug dataset show the framework outperforms baselines in realism, diversity, and training stability, with clustering improving interpretability and scalability.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for synthetic load generation in non-intrusive load monitoring research.

Abstract: Synthetic appliance data are essential for developing non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms and enabling privacy preserving energy research, yet the scarcity of labeled datasets remains a significant barrier. Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability. These findings establish the proposed framework as an effective approach for synthetic load generation in non-intrusive load monitoring research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Co-GRPO introduces a unified Markov Decision Process to align masked diffusion model training with inference by jointly optimizing model and schedule parameters using trajectory-level optimization, improving generation quality across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion models have a discrepancy between training (single-step BERT-style objective) and inference (multi-step iterative process with schedules), leaving inference schedules unoptimized during training.

Method: Reformulate generation as a unified MDP that incorporates both model and inference schedule, apply Group Relative Policy Optimization at trajectory level to cooperatively optimize parameters under shared reward without backpropagation through multi-step generation.

Result: Empirical results across four benchmarks (ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, DPG-Bench) demonstrate effectiveness with improved generation quality.

Conclusion: Co-GRPO holistically optimizes training and inference, aligning them more thoroughly to substantially enhance masked diffusion model performance.

Abstract: Recently, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have shown promising potential across vision, language, and cross-modal generation. However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality. Empirical results across four benchmarks-ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench-demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Arunkumar V,Nivethitha S,Sharan Srinivas,Gangadharan G. R*

TL;DR: Person-centered management can coexist with algorithmic oversight if the oversight is transparent and explainable; unclear oversight weakens HR-performance links, demonstrating why linear models miss this pattern.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether person-centered management can survive when algorithms take on managerial roles, addressing the limitation that standard tools often miss nonlinear worker responses to algorithmic systems.

Method: A Double Machine Learning framework was used to estimate a moderated mediation model without restrictive functional forms, analyzing survey data from 464 gig workers.

Result: Found a clear nonmonotonic pattern: supportive HR practices improve worker wellbeing, but their link to performance weakens in a "murky middle" where algorithmic oversight is present but unclear, and strengthens again when oversight is transparent and explainable.

Conclusion: The study concludes that simple linear specifications can miss nonmonotonic patterns and sometimes suggest opposite conclusions. For platform design, practical implications include that partly defined control creates confusion, but clear rules and credible recourse can make strong oversight workable. Methodologically, it demonstrates how Double Machine Learning can estimate conditional indirect effects in organizational research without forcing linear assumptions.

Abstract: A central question for the future of work is whether person centered management can survive when algorithms take on managerial roles. Standard tools often miss what is happening because worker responses to algorithmic systems are rarely linear. We use a Double Machine Learning framework to estimate a moderated mediation model without imposing restrictive functional forms. Using survey data from 464 gig workers, we find a clear nonmonotonic pattern. Supportive HR practices improve worker wellbeing, but their link to performance weakens in a murky middle where algorithmic oversight is present yet hard to interpret. The relationship strengthens again when oversight is transparent and explainable. These results show why simple linear specifications can miss the pattern and sometimes suggest the opposite conclusion. For platform design, the message is practical: control that is only partly defined creates confusion, but clear rules and credible recourse can make strong oversight workable. Methodologically, the paper shows how Double Machine Learning can be used to estimate conditional indirect effects in organizational research without forcing the data into a linear shape.

*Qingyue Cao,Bo Jin,Changwei Gong,Xin Tong,Wenzheng Li,Xiaodong Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph anomaly detection method using a multi-head spectral-adaptive GNN with dynamic filters and dual regularization to handle complex patterns and heterophily.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph anomaly detection struggles with complex and variable abnormal patterns due to disguised nodes and mixed homophily-heterophily, while fixed filters in spectral GNNs cause over-smoothing and lack adaptability.

Method: Propose MHSA-GNN with a lightweight hypernetwork that uses a 'spectral fingerprint' (structural statistics and Rayleigh quotient) to dynamically generate Chebyshev filter parameters per instance, enabling customized filtering. Includes dual regularization: teacher-student contrastive learning for accuracy and Barlow Twins diversity loss for orthogonality in multi-heads.

Result: The method effectively preserves high-frequency abnormal signals and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in experiments on four real-world datasets, showing excellent robustness on highly heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion: MHSA-GNN provides an adaptive solution for graph anomaly detection, overcoming limitations of fixed filters and improving performance in complex scenarios like fraud detection.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection technology has broad applications in financial fraud and risk control. However, existing graph anomaly detection methods often face significant challenges when dealing with complex and variable abnormal patterns, as anomalous nodes are often disguised and mixed with normal nodes, leading to the coexistence of homophily and heterophily in the graph domain. Recent spectral graph neural networks have made notable progress in addressing this issue; however, current techniques typically employ fixed, globally shared filters. This 'one-size-fits-all' approach can easily cause over-smoothing, erasing critical high-frequency signals needed for fraud detection, and lacks adaptive capabilities for different graph instances. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Head Spectral-Adaptive Graph Neural Network (MHSA-GNN). The core innovation is the design of a lightweight hypernetwork that, conditioned on a 'spectral fingerprint' containing structural statistics and Rayleigh quotient features, dynamically generates Chebyshev filter parameters tailored to each instance. This enables a customized filtering strategy for each node and its local subgraph. Additionally, to prevent mode collapse in the multi-head mechanism, we introduce a novel dual regularization strategy that combines teacher-student contrastive learning (TSC) to ensure representation accuracy and Barlow Twins diversity loss (BTD) to enforce orthogonality among heads. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively preserves high-frequency abnormal signals and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, especially showing excellent robustness on highly heterogeneous datasets.

### [91] [Learning from Negative Examples: Why Warning-Framed Training Data Teaches What It Warns Against](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22293)
*Tsogt-Ochir Enkhbayar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Warning-framed content in training data fails to teach language models to avoid warned behavior, as they reproduce flagged content at similar rates to direct exposure, due to overlapping latent features for describing and performing actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why language models exposed to warnings in training data still reproduce the warned-against behavior, analyzing the mechanisms behind their failure to internalize warnings.

Method: Experiments comparing models given warning-framed content vs. direct content, sparse autoencoder analysis to examine latent features, and identification of overlapping activations.

Result: Models reproduced flagged content at 76.7% (warning context) vs. 83.3% (direct context), with no statistical difference. Feature #8684 showed comparable activation in both contexts, indicating a failure of orthogonalization and the presence of stealth slip.

Conclusion: Statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current architectures, with models learning what tends to follow context rather than why it appears. Training-time feature ablation can mitigate this, but prompting and inference-time steering do not.

Abstract: Warning-framed content in training data (e.g., "DO NOT USE - this code is vulnerable") does not, it turns out, teach language models to avoid the warned-against behavior. In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: "describing X" and "performing X" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call "stealth slip", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely. Prompting and inference-time steering do not fix this; training-time feature ablation does. The upshot is that statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current architectures. Models learn what tends to follow a context, not why it appeared there.

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical MoE (QMoE) uses quantum routing for better efficiency and performance on non-linear tasks, validated on NISQ hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical MoE suffers from expert imbalance and computational complexity; quantum routing may solve these via interference and high-dimensional kernels.

Method: Ablation study with Quantum Gating Network (Router) using quantum feature maps and wave interference, tested on Two Moons dataset under noise.

Result: Quantum Router shows topological advantage, untangling non-linear data with higher parameter efficiency than classical routers, feasible on NISQ hardware.

Conclusion: QML enhances MoE routing, enabling robust, efficient handling of complex data, with applications in federated learning and privacy-preserving ML.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling deep learning models, yet it is fundamentally limited by challenges such as expert imbalance and the computational complexity of classical routing mechanisms. This paper investigates the potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to address these limitations through a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Mixture of Experts (QMoE) architecture. Specifically, we conduct an ablation study using a Quantum Gating Network (Router) combined with classical experts to isolate the source of quantum advantage. Our central finding validates the Interference Hypothesis: by leveraging quantum feature maps (Angle Embedding) and wave interference, the Quantum Router acts as a high-dimensional kernel method, enabling the modeling of complex, non-linear decision boundaries with superior parameter efficiency compared to its classical counterparts. Experimental results on non-linearly separable data, such as the Two Moons dataset, demonstrate that the Quantum Router achieves a significant topological advantage, effectively "untangling" data distributions that linear classical routers fail to separate efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the architecture's robustness against simulated quantum noise, confirming its feasibility for near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. We discuss practical applications in federated learning, privacy-preserving machine learning, and adaptive systems that could benefit from this quantum-enhanced routing paradigm.

*Sultan Amed,Chan Yu Hang,Sayantan Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PDx is an adaptive MLOps-driven decision system for credit risk prediction using probability of default modeling, addressing static model degradation and operational challenges in digital lending.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional PD models focus on accuracy but lack continuous adaptation to changing borrower behavior, leading to static models that degrade over time in production. Many financial institutions struggle to deploy and maintain ML models effectively in real-world MLOps settings.

Method: PDx uses a dynamic, end-to-end model lifecycle management approach with an MLOps pipeline, including continuous monitoring, retraining, and validation. It employs a champion-challenger framework to update models with the latest data and select the best-performing one through out-of-time validation to handle data drift.

Result: Empirical analysis shows that decision tree-based ensemble models consistently outperform others (like linear models and neural networks) in default classification but require frequent updates to sustain performance in PDx. PDx reduces value erosion, especially for short-term, small-ticket loans, as validated on datasets from peer-to-peer lending, business loans, and auto loans.

Conclusion: PDx effectively mitigates challenges in credit risk forecasting by providing a scalable, adaptive MLOps solution that ensures model resilience against data drift and changing patterns, enhancing prediction accuracy and operational efficiency for digital lenders.

Abstract: This paper presents PDx, an adaptive, machine learning operations (MLOps) driven decision system for forecasting credit risk using probability of default (PD) modeling in digital lending. While conventional PD models prioritize predictive accuracy during model development with complex machine learning algorithms, they often overlook continuous adaptation to changing borrower behaviour, resulting in static models that degrade over time in production and generate inaccurate default predictions. Many financial institutes also find it difficult transitioning ML models from development environment to production and maintaining their health. With PDx we aimed to addresses these limitations using a dynamic, end-to-end model lifecycle management approach that integrates continuous model monitoring, retraining, and validation through a robust MLOps pipeline. We introduced a dynamic champion-challenger framework for PDx to regularly update baseline models to recalibrate independent parameters with the latest data and select the best-performing model through out-of-time validation, ensuring resilience against data drift and changing credit risk patterns. Our empirical analysis shows that decision tree-based ensemble models consistently outperform others in classifying defaulters but require frequent updates to sustain performance. Linear models (e.g., logistic regression) and neural networks exhibit greater performance degradation. The study demonstrate with PDx we can mitigates value erosion for digital lenders, particularly in short-term, small-ticket loans, where borrower behavior shifts rapidly. We have validated the effectiveness of PDx using datasets from peer-to-peer lending, business loans, and auto loans, demonstrating its scalability and adaptability for modern credit risk forecasting.

TL;DR: LLMBoost is an ensemble fine-tuning framework for LLMs that leverages intermediate hidden states across models via cross-model attention, chain training, and near-parallel inference to improve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ensemble learning approaches for LLMs treat models as black boxes, combining inputs or final outputs while ignoring rich internal representations and interactions across models, limiting performance enhancements.

Method: Introduces three innovations: 1. Cross-model attention mechanism for successor models to access and fuse hidden states from predecessors. 2. Chain training paradigm to progressively fine-tune connected models with an error-suppression objective. 3. Near-parallel inference paradigm that pipelines hidden states layer by layer for efficient inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on commonsense and arithmetic reasoning tasks show that LLMBoost consistently boosts accuracy while reducing inference latency, supported by theoretical proofs of monotonic improvements under bounded correction assumptions.

Conclusion: LLMBoost offers a novel ensemble approach that bridges internal model states to enhance performance efficiency, overcoming limitations of black-box methods.

Abstract: Ensemble learning of LLMs has emerged as a promising alternative to enhance performance, but existing approaches typically treat models as black boxes, combining the inputs or final outputs while overlooking the rich internal representations and interactions across models.In this work, we introduce LLMBoost, a novel ensemble fine-tuning framework that breaks this barrier by explicitly leveraging intermediate states of LLMs. Inspired by the boosting paradigm, LLMBoost incorporates three key innovations. First, a cross-model attention mechanism enables successor models to access and fuse hidden states from predecessors, facilitating hierarchical error correction and knowledge transfer. Second, a chain training paradigm progressively fine-tunes connected models with an error-suppression objective, ensuring that each model rectifies the mispredictions of its predecessor with minimal additional computation. Third, a near-parallel inference paradigm design pipelines hidden states across models layer by layer, achieving inference efficiency approaching single-model decoding. We further establish the theoretical foundations of LLMBoost, proving that sequential integration guarantees monotonic improvements under bounded correction assumptions. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMBoost consistently boosts accuracy while reducing inference latency.

TL;DR: OFS is an optimistic feasible search method for online learning of threshold policies under fairness and service constraints, outperforming baselines in synthetic and semi-synthetic closed-loop benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Closed-loop decision-making systems face challenges with fairness, service constraints, and feedback effects (e.g., non-stationary data, amplified disparities), requiring methods that adapt online while ensuring feasibility.

Method: Proposes Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS), a grid-based method using confidence bounds for reward and constraint residuals; selects thresholds based on feasibility and optimistic reward or minimal constraint violation.

Result: OFS achieves higher reward with smaller cumulative constraint violation than baselines in synthetic stable contraction and semi-synthetic German Credit/COMPAS benchmarks, performing near-oracle relative to best feasible fixed thresholds.

Conclusion: OFS is effective for low-dimensional, interpretable policy classes, directly targeting feasible high-utility thresholds and handling constraints in non-stationary environments.

Abstract: Closed-loop decision-making systems (e.g., lending, screening, or recidivism risk assessment) often operate under fairness and service constraints while inducing feedback effects: decisions change who appears in the future, yielding non-stationary data and potentially amplifying disparities. We study online learning of a one-dimensional threshold policy from bandit feedback under demographic parity (DP) and, optionally, service-rate constraints. The learner observes only a scalar score each round and selects a threshold; reward and constraint residuals are revealed only for the chosen threshold.
  We propose Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS), a simple grid-based method that maintains confidence bounds for reward and constraint residuals for each candidate threshold. At each round, OFS selects a threshold that appears feasible under confidence bounds and, among those, maximizes optimistic reward; if no threshold appears feasible, OFS selects the threshold minimizing optimistic constraint violation. This design directly targets feasible high-utility thresholds and is particularly effective for low-dimensional, interpretable policy classes where discretization is natural.
  We evaluate OFS on (i) a synthetic closed-loop benchmark with stable contraction dynamics and (ii) two semi-synthetic closed-loop benchmarks grounded in German Credit and COMPAS, constructed by training a score model and feeding group-dependent acceptance decisions back into population composition. Across all environments, OFS achieves higher reward with smaller cumulative constraint violation than unconstrained and primal-dual bandit baselines, and is near-oracle relative to the best feasible fixed threshold under the same sweep procedure. Experiments are reproducible and organized with double-blind-friendly relative outputs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Short-term precipitation nowcasting is an inherently uncertain and under-constrained spatiotemporal forecasting problem, especially for rapidly evolving and extreme weather events. Existing generative approaches rely primarily on visual conditioning, leaving future motion weakly constrained and ambiguous. We propose a language-aware multimodal nowcasting framework(LangPrecip) that treats meteorological text as a semantic motion constraint on precipitation evolution. By formulating nowcasting as a semantically constrained trajectory generation problem under the Rectified Flow paradigm, our method enables efficient and physically consistent integration of textual and radar information in latent space.We further introduce LangPrecip-160k, a large-scale multimodal dataset with 160k paired radar sequences and motion descriptions. Experiments on Swedish and MRMS datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 60 \% and 19\% gains in heavy-rainfall CSI at an 80-minute lead time.

### [98] [Decomposing Uncertainty in Probabilistic Knowledge Graph Embeddings: Why Entity Variance Is Not Enough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22318)
*Chorok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Probabilistic knowledge graph embeddings lack relation-sensitive uncertainty estimation, conflating emerging entities and novel relational contexts, which hurts OOD detection. The paper proposes a decomposition into semantic and structural uncertainty (CAGP method), showing significant gains in AUROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic knowledge graph embeddings use entity-level variances that are relation-agnostic, failing to distinguish between emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships). This leads to poor performance on temporal distribution shift.

Method: Formalize uncertainty decomposition into semantic uncertainty (from entity embedding variance) and structural uncertainty (from entity-relation co-occurrence). Prove these are non-redundant. Introduce CAGP method that combines semantic and structural uncertainty via learned weights.

Result: CAGP achieves 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection across multiple benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10), a 60-80% relative improvement over baselines. On selective prediction, reduces errors by 43% at 85% answer rate. Empirical validation confirms frequency overlap in datasets.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a fundamental limitation of relation-agnostic uncertainty, proposes a decomposition into complementary semantic and structural components, and shows CAGP effectively improves OOD detection and selective prediction in knowledge graph embeddings.

Abstract: Probabilistic knowledge graph embeddings represent entities as distributions, using learned variances to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We identify a fundamental limitation: these variances are relation-agnostic, meaning an entity receives identical uncertainty regardless of relational context. This conflates two distinct out-of-distribution phenomena that behave oppositely: emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships). We prove an impossibility result: any uncertainty estimator using only entity-level statistics independent of relation context achieves near-random OOD detection on novel contexts. We empirically validate this on three datasets, finding 100 percent of novel-context triples have frequency-matched in-distribution counterparts. This explains why existing probabilistic methods achieve 0.99 AUROC on random corruptions but only 0.52-0.64 on temporal distribution shift. We formalize uncertainty decomposition into complementary components: semantic uncertainty from entity embedding variance (detecting emerging entities) and structural uncertainty from entity-relation co-occurrence (detecting novel contexts). Our main theoretical result proves these signals are non-redundant, and that any convex combination strictly dominates either signal alone. Our method (CAGP) combines semantic and structural uncertainty via learned weights, achieving 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection across multiple benchmarks, a 60-80 percent relative improvement over relation-agnostic baselines. Empirical validation confirms complete frequency overlap on three datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10). On selective prediction, our method reduces errors by 43 percent at 85 percent answer rate.

### [99] [Expert System for Bitcoin Forecasting: Integrating Global Liquidity via TimeXer Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22326)
*Sravan Karthick T*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adding global M2 liquidity as an exogenous variable with a 12-week lag to a TimeXer model improves Bitcoin price forecasts, reducing error by 89% vs univariate baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bitcoin price forecasting is challenging due to extreme volatility and non-stationarity, which traditional univariate time-series models often fail to address over long horizons. This paper aims to address this gap by incorporating macroeconomic factors, specifically Global M2 Liquidity, as exogenous variables to improve forecasting stability and accuracy.

Method: The paper uses the TimeXer architecture to compare a liquidity-conditioned forecasting model (TimeXer-Exog) against benchmarks including LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and a standard univariate TimeXer. The model integrates Global M2 Liquidity aggregated from 18 major economies as a leading exogenous variable with a 12-week lag structure. Experiments are conducted on daily Bitcoin price data from January 2020 to August 2025, evaluating performance at a 70-day forecast horizon using mean squared error (MSE).

Result: At a 70-day forecast horizon, the proposed TimeXer-Exog model achieves an MSE of 1.08e8, outperforming the univariate TimeXer baseline by over 89 percent. The explicit macroeconomic conditioning significantly stabilizes long-horizon forecasts, demonstrating that conditioning deep learning models on global liquidity provides substantial improvements in Bitcoin price forecasting.

Conclusion: The integration of Global M2 Liquidity as an exogenous variable with a 12-week lag, using the TimeXer-Exog model, significantly improves long-horizon Bitcoin price forecasting by stabilizing predictions and reducing error compared to univariate and other state-of-the-art models.

### [100] [The Effectiveness of Approximate Regularized Replay for Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22337)
*Matthew Riemer,Erik Miehling,Miao Liu,Djallel Bouneffouf,Murray Campbell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA fine-tuning can degrade model capabilities; tweaks like adding regularization and data interleaving fix the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient methods like LoRA are effective but can degrade model performance during instruction-tuning.

Method: Using a regularized approximate replay approach that penalizes KL divergence and interleaves next token prediction data.

Result: This technique preserves general knowledge without hindering plasticity to new tasks with modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: Small procedural changes in fine-tuning can successfully mitigate performance degradation in LoRA-based models.

Abstract: Although parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA, only modify a small subset of parameters, they can have a significant impact on the model. Our instruction-tuning experiments show that LoRA-based supervised fine-tuning can catastrophically degrade model capabilities, even when trained on very small datasets for relatively few steps. With that said, we demonstrate that while the most straightforward approach (that is likely the most used in practice) fails spectacularly, small tweaks to the training procedure with very little overhead can virtually eliminate the problem. Particularly, in this paper we consider a regularized approximate replay approach which penalizes KL divergence with respect to the initial model and interleaves in data for next token prediction from a different, yet similar, open access corpus to what was used in pre-training. When applied to Qwen instruction-tuned models, we find that this recipe preserves general knowledge in the model without hindering plasticity to new tasks by adding a modest amount of computational overhead.

### [101] [Completed Hyperparameter Transfer across Modules, Width, Depth, Batch and Duration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22382)
*Bruno Mlodozeniec,Pierre Ablin,Louis Béthune,Dan Busbridge,Michal Klein,Jason Ramapuram,Marco Cuturi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Complete^{(d)} Parameterisation to unify hyperparameter scaling across width, depth, batch size, and duration, enabling transfer of per-module hyperparameters for improved training efficiency in large models like LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning is critical for large-scale model performance, but existing methods like μP only handle transfer across sizes; the paper aims to extend this to more scaling axes and per-module optimization.

Method: Developed Complete^{(d)} Parameterisation based on CompleteP, unified scaling in width, depth, batch size, and training duration, and proposed guidelines for per-module hyperparameter optimization and transfer.

Result: Showed that hyperparameter transfer is feasible with the right parameterisation, covering hyperparameters like learning rates, AdamW parameters, and weight decay; experiments demonstrated speed improvements in LLMs.

Conclusion: The Complete^{(d)} Parameterisation enables effective per-module hyperparameter transfer across scaling dimensions, offering practical guidelines for optimization and enhancing training efficiency in large models.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning can dramatically impact training stability and final performance of large-scale models. Recent works on neural network parameterisations, such as $μ$P, have enabled transfer of optimal global hyperparameters across model sizes. These works propose an empirical practice of search for optimal global base hyperparameters at a small model size, and transfer to a large size. We extend these works in two key ways. To handle scaling along most important scaling axes, we propose the Complete$^{(d)}$ Parameterisation that unifies scaling in width and depth -- using an adaptation of CompleteP -- as well as in batch-size and training duration. Secondly, with our parameterisation, we investigate per-module hyperparameter optimisation and transfer. We characterise the empirical challenges of navigating the high-dimensional hyperparameter landscape, and propose practical guidelines for tackling this optimisation problem. We demonstrate that, with the right parameterisation, hyperparameter transfer holds even in the per-module hyperparameter regime. Our study covers an extensive range of optimisation hyperparameters of modern models: learning rates, AdamW parameters, weight decay, initialisation scales, and residual block multipliers. Our experiments demonstrate significant training speed improvements in Large Language Models with the transferred per-module hyperparameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bandit Layer Importance Sampling strategy adaptively selects informative nodes to optimize GNNs for large graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are computationally expensive for large graphs due to processing every neighbor, causing memory bottlenecks.

Method: Introduces BLISS using multi-armed bandits to dynamically select nodes per layer, balancing exploration and exploitation.

Result: BLISS maintains or exceeds full-batch training accuracy in experiments, integrating with GCNs and GATs.

Conclusion: BLISS offers an adaptive, efficient sampling approach to enhance GNN scalability without compromising performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, but their application to large graphs is hindered by computational costs. The need to process every neighbor for each node creates memory and computational bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce BLISS, a Bandit Layer Importance Sampling Strategy. It uses multi-armed bandits to dynamically select the most informative nodes at each layer, balancing exploration and exploitation to ensure comprehensive graph coverage. Unlike existing static sampling methods, BLISS adapts to evolving node importance, leading to more informed node selection and improved performance. It demonstrates versatility by integrating with both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), adapting its selection policy to their specific aggregation mechanisms. Experiments show that BLISS maintains or exceeds the accuracy of full-batch training.

### [103] [Causality-Inspired Safe Residual Correction for Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22428)
*Jianxiang Xie,Yuncheng Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRC is a causality-inspired safe residual correction framework that ensures non-degradation while improving forecasting accuracy via a four-fold safety mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern forecasters suffer from systematic errors and lack guarantees against performance degradation; existing post-hoc correction methods are greedy and can overcorrect reliable predictions.

Method: CRC uses a causality-inspired encoder to decouple self- and cross-variable dynamics, a hybrid corrector for residual errors, and a four-fold safety mechanism to prevent harmful updates.

Result: CRC consistently improves accuracy and achieves high non-degradation rates (NDR) across multiple datasets and forecasting backbones.

Conclusion: CRC provides a safe and reliable residual correction framework that ensures non-degradation while improving forecasting accuracy across diverse datasets and models.

Abstract: While modern multivariate forecasters such as Transformers and GNNs achieve strong benchmark performance, they often suffer from systematic errors at specific variables or horizons and, critically, lack guarantees against performance degradation in deployment. Existing post-hoc residual correction methods attempt to fix these errors, but are inherently greedy: although they may improve average accuracy, they can also "help in the wrong way" by overcorrecting reliable predictions and causing local failures in unseen scenarios.
  To address this critical "safety gap," we propose CRC (Causality-inspired Safe Residual Correction), a plug-and-play framework explicitly designed to ensure non-degradation. CRC follows a divide-and-conquer philosophy: it employs a causality-inspired encoder to expose direction-aware structure by decoupling self- and cross-variable dynamics, and a hybrid corrector to model residual errors. Crucially, the correction process is governed by a strict four-fold safety mechanism that prevents harmful updates.
  Experiments across multiple datasets and forecasting backbones show that CRC consistently improves accuracy, while an in-depth ablation study confirms that its core safety mechanisms ensure exceptionally high non-degradation rates (NDR), making CRC a correction framework suited for safe and reliable deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AFA-LoRA introduces a training strategy with an annealed activation function to add non-linear expressivity to LoRA while keeping it mergeable, bridging the gap between linear and non-linear training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's linear adaptation limits its expressive power, creating a gap compared to non-linear training, which hampers performance in parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Method: Propose AFA-LoRA with an annealed activation function that transitions from non-linear to linear during training, enabling initial strong representational capabilities that converge to a mergeable linear form.

Result: Implementations in supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding show AFA-LoRA reduces the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training.

Conclusion: AFA-LoRA enables a more powerful and practical paradigm for parameter-efficient adaptation by enhancing LoRA's expressivity without compromising mergeability.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. However, its linear adaptation process limits its expressive power. This means there is a gap between the expressive power of linear training and non-linear training. To bridge this gap, we propose AFA-LoRA, a novel training strategy that brings non-linear expressivity to LoRA while maintaining its seamless mergeability. Our key innovation is an annealed activation function that transitions from a non-linear to a linear transformation during training, allowing the adapter to initially adopt stronger representational capabilities before converging to a mergeable linear form. We implement our method on supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding. The results show that AFA-LoRA reduces the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training. This work enables a more powerful and practical paradigm of parameter-efficient adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMBIT is a gray-box framework that enhances physical mobility models with interpretable tree models to improve OD flow prediction accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a conflict between high accuracy and clear interpretability in OD flow prediction for GIS and urban analytics, requiring a solution that balances both.

Method: Conducts an audit of classical spatial interaction models on NYC taxi data, then builds residual learners using gradient-boosted trees and SHAP analysis on top of physical baselines.

Result: Physics-grounded residuals achieve accuracy close to strong tree-based predictors while remaining interpretable, and POI-anchored residuals are robust in spatial generalization.

Conclusion: AMBIT provides a reproducible pipeline with diagnostics and error analysis, effectively addressing the accuracy-interpretability trade-off for urban decision-making.

Abstract: Origin-destination (OD) flow prediction remains a core task in GIS and urban analytics, yet practical deployments face two conflicting needs: high accuracy and clear interpretability. This paper develops AMBIT, a gray-box framework that augments physical mobility baselines with interpretable tree models. We begin with a comprehensive audit of classical spatial interaction models on a year-long, hourly NYC taxi OD dataset. The audit shows that most physical models are fragile at this temporal resolution; PPML gravity is the strongest physical baseline, while constrained variants improve when calibrated on full OD margins but remain notably weaker. We then build residual learners on top of physical baselines using gradient-boosted trees and SHAP analysis, demonstrating that (i) physics-grounded residuals approach the accuracy of a strong tree-based predictor while retaining interpretable structure, and (ii) POI-anchored residuals are consistently competitive and most robust under spatial generalization. We provide a reproducible pipeline, rich diagnostics, and spatial error analysis designed for urban decision-making.

*Jong-Ik Park,Shreyas Chaudhari,Srinivasa Pranav,Carlee Joe-Wong,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLUE is a gradient-free method that initializes a target model by learning convex combination coefficients of fixed expert models via gradient-free updates, requiring only two forward passes per step, outperforming heuristic blending and matching backpropagation-based mixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In deployed systems, multiple pretrained specialist models coexist, but new target domains require a generalized model that performs well beyond any single specialist's domain. Prior works blend expert models for initialization, but heuristic blending (e.g., based on data size or proxy metrics) often reduces target-domain accuracy, and learning coefficients via backpropagation is computationally expensive.

Method: Propose GLUE (Gradient-free Learning To Unify Experts), which initializes the target model as a convex combination of fixed experts. It learns the mixture coefficients using a gradient-free two-point update (SPSA), requiring only two forward passes per step, avoiding full backpropagation.

Result: Experiments on three datasets and three network architectures show that GLUE produces a prior that can be fine-tuned effectively, outperforming baselines. It improves test accuracy by up to 8.5% over data-size weighting and up to 9.1% over proxy-metric selection, either outperforming or matching backpropagation-based full-gradient mixing within 1.4%.

Conclusion: GLUE provides an efficient and effective gradient-free approach to unify expert models for domain expansion, reducing computational cost while achieving superior or comparable accuracy compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: In many deployed systems (multilingual ASR, cross-hospital imaging, region-specific perception), multiple pretrained specialist models coexist. Yet, new target domains often require domain expansion: a generalized model that performs well beyond any single specialist's domain. Given such a new target domain, prior works seek a single strong initialization prior for the model parameters by first blending expert models to initialize a target model. However, heuristic blending -- using coefficients based on data size or proxy metrics -- often yields lower target-domain test accuracy, and learning the coefficients on the target loss typically requires computationally-expensive full backpropagation through the network. We propose GLUE, Gradient-free Learning To Unify Experts, which initializes the target model as a convex combination of fixed experts, learning the mixture coefficients of this combination via a gradient-free two-point (SPSA) update that requires only two forward passes per step. Across experiments on three datasets and three network architectures, GLUE produces a single prior that can be fine-tuned effectively to outperform baselines. GLUE improves test accuracy by up to 8.5% over data-size weighting and by up to 9.1% over proxy-metric selection. GLUE either outperforms backpropagation-based full-gradient mixing or matches its performance within 1.4%.

### [107] [The Bayesian Geometry of Transformer Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22471)
*Naman Aggarwal,Siddhartha R. Dalal,Vishal Misra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers act as Bayesian wind tunnels by learning to infer true posteriors in controlled tasks, outperforming MLPs and using a consistent geometric mechanism in their architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to rigorously verify if transformers perform Bayesian reasoning in context, given that natural data lack analytic posteriors and large models might rely on memorization rather than reasoning.

Method: Constructing Bayesian wind tunnels—controlled environments with known true posteriors and no memorization—and testing transformers vs. capacity-matched MLPs on tasks like bijection elimination and HMM state tracking.

Result: Small transformers accurately reproduce Bayesian posteriors (10^-3-10^-4 bit accuracy), while MLPs fail; transformers use a geometric mechanism with residual streams for belief, feed-forward networks for posterior updates, and attention for routing.

Conclusion: Hierarchical attention enables Bayesian inference through geometric design, explaining why attention is necessary and flat architectures fail; Bayesian wind tunnels offer a foundation for mechanistic studies connecting small systems to large language models.

Abstract: Transformers often appear to perform Bayesian reasoning in context, but verifying this rigorously has been impossible: natural data lack analytic posteriors, and large models conflate reasoning with memorization. We address this by constructing \emph{Bayesian wind tunnels} -- controlled environments where the true posterior is known in closed form and memorization is provably impossible. In these settings, small transformers reproduce Bayesian posteriors with $10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ bit accuracy, while capacity-matched MLPs fail by orders of magnitude, establishing a clear architectural separation.
  Across two tasks -- bijection elimination and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state tracking -- we find that transformers implement Bayesian inference through a consistent geometric mechanism: residual streams serve as the belief substrate, feed-forward networks perform the posterior update, and attention provides content-addressable routing. Geometric diagnostics reveal orthogonal key bases, progressive query-key alignment, and a low-dimensional value manifold parameterized by posterior entropy. During training this manifold unfurls while attention patterns remain stable, a \emph{frame-precision dissociation} predicted by recent gradient analyses.
  Taken together, these results demonstrate that hierarchical attention realizes Bayesian inference by geometric design, explaining both the necessity of attention and the failure of flat architectures. Bayesian wind tunnels provide a foundation for mechanistically connecting small, verifiable systems to reasoning phenomena observed in large language models.

Method: The model integrates density and confidence factors to design a noise-resistant weight update mechanism and a dynamic sampling strategy. These modules work together to orchestrate weight updates, sample region partitioning, and region-guided sampling for collaborative optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on 20 public imbalanced datasets show that the proposed model significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study successfully bridges the gap by achieving collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training, offering a simple yet effective solution with available code for implementation.

Abstract: Numerous studies attempt to mitigate classification bias caused by class imbalance. However, existing studies have yet to explore the collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training. This constraint hinders further performance improvements. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a collaborative optimization Boosting model of multiclass imbalanced learning. This model is simple but effective by integrating the density factor and the confidence factor, this study designs a noise-resistant weight update mechanism and a dynamic sampling strategy. Rather than functioning as independent components, these modules are tightly integrated to orchestrate weight updates, sample region partitioning, and region-guided sampling. Thus, this study achieves the collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training. Extensive experiments on 20 public imbalanced datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that uses latent-space alignment and graph neural networks to handle concept drift without continuous retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying AI-based models for threat detection in dynamic IoT NetFlow traffic is limited by reliance on static datasets and concept drift, while periodic retraining causes high computational costs and forgetting.

Method: Train classifier once on historical traffic latent representations; use an alignment model to map new traffic to this latent space; transform low-dimensional latent representations into graphs for classification by a graph neural network.

Result: Framework shows robust detection performance on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets under concept drift.

Conclusion: The framework is promising for practical deployment in dynamic, large-scale IoT environments as it addresses drift without continuous retraining.

Abstract: Although AI-based models have achieved high accuracy in IoT threat detection, their deployment in enterprise environments is constrained by reliance on stationary datasets that fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world IoT NetFlow traffic, which is frequently affected by concept drift. Existing solutions typically rely on periodic classifier retraining, resulting in high computational overhead and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that eliminates the need for continuous classifier retraining. The proposed approach trains a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, while an alignment model maps incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space prior to classification, thereby preserving knowledge of previously observed attacks. To capture inter-instance relationships among attack samples, the low-dimensional latent representations are further transformed into a graph-structured format and classified using a graph neural network. Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains robust detection performance under concept drift. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical deployment in dynamic and large-scale IoT environments.

TL;DR: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis extends to parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA, revealing sparse subnetworks that match dense adapter performance, leading to the proposed Partial-LoRA method for efficient adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis holds in parameter-efficient fine-tuning, specifically LoRA methods, for deeper theoretical understanding and more efficient adaptation strategies.

Method: Propose Partial-LoRA, a method to systematically identify and train sparse low-rank adapters aligned with task-relevant subspaces of pre-trained models.

Result: Sparse subnetworks in LoRA can match dense adapter performance, with effectiveness depending more on layer-wise sparsity than exact weights. Partial-LoRA reduces trainable parameters by up to 87% while maintaining or improving accuracy across 8 vision and 12 language tasks in single-task and multi-task settings.

Conclusion: LTH holds in LoRA-based PEFT, providing insights into transfer learning and pretraining-fine-tuning interplay, and enabling more efficient adaptation strategies like Partial-LoRA.

Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests that over-parameterized neural networks contain sparse subnetworks ("winning tickets") capable of matching full model performance when trained from scratch. With the growing reliance on fine-tuning large pretrained models, we investigate whether LTH extends to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), specifically focusing on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods. Our key finding is that LTH holds within LoRAs, revealing sparse subnetworks that can match the performance of dense adapters. In particular, we find that the effectiveness of sparse subnetworks depends more on how much sparsity is applied in each layer than on the exact weights included in the subnetwork. Building on this insight, we propose Partial-LoRA, a method that systematically identifies said subnetworks and trains sparse low-rank adapters aligned with task-relevant subspaces of the pre-trained model. Experiments across 8 vision and 12 language tasks in both single-task and multi-task settings show that Partial-LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to 87\%, while maintaining or improving accuracy. Our results not only deepen our theoretical understanding of transfer learning and the interplay between pretraining and fine-tuning but also open new avenues for developing more efficient adaptation strategies.

*Lucky Susanto,Anasta Pranawijayana,Cortino Sukotjo,Soni Prasad,Derry Wijaya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Predicting correctness of LLM responses in high-stakes domains using metadata and hallucination signals can improve accuracy up to 7.14%, but methods are not robust enough for critical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are used in high-stakes domains like healthcare, where hallucinated information is a major concern, but predicting correctness of responses remains underexplored.

Method: Analyze GPT-4o and OSS-120B on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam, using metadata and hallucination signals across three prompting strategies to build correctness predictors for each model-prompting pair.

Result: Metadata-based approach improves accuracy by up to +7.14% and achieves 83.12% precision over a baseline; actual hallucination strongly indicates incorrectness, but metadata signals alone are unreliable predictors of hallucination; prompting strategies alter models' internal behaviors and predictive utility of metadata.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for developing reliability signals in LLMs, but explored methods are not yet robust enough for high-stakes deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and medical education, where the risk of generating factually incorrect (i.e., hallucinated) information is a major concern. While significant efforts have been made to detect and mitigate such hallucinations, predicting whether an LLM's response is correct remains a critical yet underexplored problem. This study investigates the feasibility of predicting correctness by analyzing a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a reasoning-centric model (OSS-120B) on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam. We utilize metadata and hallucination signals across three distinct prompting strategies to build a correctness predictor for each (model, prompting) pair. Our findings demonstrate that this metadata-based approach can improve accuracy by up to +7.14% and achieve a precision of 83.12% over a baseline that assumes all answers are correct. We further show that while actual hallucination is a strong indicator of incorrectness, metadata signals alone are not reliable predictors of hallucination. Finally, we reveal that prompting strategies, despite not affecting overall accuracy, significantly alter the models' internal behaviors and the predictive utility of their metadata. These results present a promising direction for developing reliability signals in LLMs but also highlight that the methods explored in this paper are not yet robust enough for critical, high-stakes deployment.

Motivation: Task vectors, used to steer neural networks toward desired behaviors, often contain overlapping concepts that interfere during arithmetic operations, leading to unpredictable outcomes. Addressing this limitation is crucial for effective model editing.

Method: A principled decomposition method that identifies invariant subspaces across projections to separate each task vector into two components: shared knowledge across multiple task vectors and unique information specific to each task.

Result: The method improved multi-task merging in image classification by 5%, enabled clean style mixing in diffusion models without generation degradation, and achieved 47% toxicity reduction in language models while preserving performance on general knowledge tasks.

Conclusion: The approach provides a new framework for understanding and controlling task vector arithmetic, addressing fundamental limitations in model editing operations and offering more predictable and effective concept manipulation.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have transformed machine learning, yet adapting these models effectively to exhibit precise, concept-specific behaviors remains a significant challenge. Task vectors, defined as the difference between fine-tuned and pre-trained model parameters, provide a mechanism for steering neural networks toward desired behaviors. This has given rise to large repositories dedicated to task vectors tailored for specific behaviors. The arithmetic operation of these task vectors allows for the seamless combination of desired behaviors without the need for large datasets. However, these vectors often contain overlapping concepts that can interfere with each other during arithmetic operations, leading to unpredictable outcomes. We propose a principled decomposition method that separates each task vector into two components: one capturing shared knowledge across multiple task vectors, and another isolating information unique to each specific task. By identifying invariant subspaces across projections, our approach enables more precise control over concept manipulation without unintended amplification or diminution of other behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our decomposition method across three domains: improving multi-task merging in image classification by 5% using shared components as additional task vectors, enabling clean style mixing in diffusion models without generation degradation by mixing only the unique components, and achieving 47% toxicity reduction in language models while preserving performance on general knowledge tasks by negating the toxic information isolated to the unique component. Our approach provides a new framework for understanding and controlling task vector arithmetic, addressing fundamental limitations in model editing operations.

*Jihang Wang,Dongcheng Zhao,Ruolin Chen,Qian Zhang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a framework (ASSG and SA-PGD) to reliably evaluate adversarial robustness in Spiking Neural Networks, revealing overestimated robustness in current SNNs and emphasizing the need for better training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs have energy-efficient spiking activations, but binary/discontinuous spikes cause vanishing gradients, making gradient-based adversarial robustness evaluation unreliable, especially under strong attacks.

Method: Introduces Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG) to adaptively adjust surrogate function shape during attacks to mitigate gradient vanishing, and Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD) for adaptive step-size adversarial attacks under L∞ constraint.

Result: Increases attack success rates across various adversarial training schemes, SNN architectures, and neuron models, demonstrating more generalized and reliable assessment of SNN robustness.

Conclusion: The approach provides a more reliable adversarial robustness evaluation framework, exposing that current SNN robustness is overestimated and highlighting the necessity for more dependable adversarial training methods in SNNs.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) utilize spike-based activations to mimic the brain's energy-efficient information processing. However, the binary and discontinuous nature of spike activations causes vanishing gradients, making adversarial robustness evaluation via gradient descent unreliable. While improved surrogate gradient methods have been proposed, their effectiveness under strong adversarial attacks remains unclear. We propose a more reliable framework for evaluating SNN adversarial robustness. We theoretically analyze the degree of gradient vanishing in surrogate gradients and introduce the Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG), which adaptively evolves the shape of the surrogate function according to the input distribution during attack iterations, thereby enhancing gradient accuracy while mitigating gradient vanishing. In addition, we design an adversarial attack with adaptive step size under the $L_\infty$ constraint-Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD), achieving faster and more stable convergence under imprecise gradients. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially increases attack success rates across diverse adversarial training schemes, SNN architectures and neuron models, providing a more generalized and reliable evaluation of SNN adversarial robustness. The experimental results further reveal that the robustness of current SNNs has been significantly overestimated and highlighting the need for more dependable adversarial training methods.

*Jaebin Lee,Hankook Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimePerceiver is a unified encoder-decoder forecasting framework with aligned training that generalizes to diverse temporal prediction tasks and outperforms SOTA baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work in time-series forecasting has overly focused on encoder design while treating prediction and training as separate concerns. There is a need for a unified framework that holistically addresses input encoding, prediction (decoding), and training strategy.

Method: Generalizes forecasting to diverse temporal prediction objectives (extrapolation, interpolation, imputation). Introduces latent bottleneck representations for encoding to capture temporal and cross-channel dependencies jointly. Uses learnable queries for decoding to retrieve relevant information based on target timestamps.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework consistently and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The TimePerceiver framework successfully unifies encoder-decoder design with training strategy to address the holistic requirements of time-series forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: In machine learning, effective modeling requires a holistic consideration of how to encode inputs, make predictions (i.e., decoding), and train the model. However, in time-series forecasting, prior work has predominantly focused on encoder design, often treating prediction and training as separate or secondary concerns. In this paper, we propose TimePerceiver, a unified encoder-decoder forecasting framework that is tightly aligned with an effective training strategy. To be specific, we first generalize the forecasting task to include diverse temporal prediction objectives such as extrapolation, interpolation, and imputation. Since this generalization requires handling input and target segments that are arbitrarily positioned along the temporal axis, we design a novel encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly perceive and adapt to these varying positions. For encoding, we introduce a set of latent bottleneck representations that can interact with all input segments to jointly capture temporal and cross-channel dependencies. For decoding, we leverage learnable queries corresponding to target timestamps to effectively retrieve relevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of benchmark datasets.

### [115] [On Admissible Rank-based Input Normalization Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22587)
*Taeyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies structural instability of existing differentiable sorting/ranking operators in rank-based normalization and proposes axioms for stable operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rank-based normalization is crucial in ML for robustness, but existing operators fail under transformations and variations, lacking formal conditions.

Method: Propose three axioms for invariance and stability, prove structural requirement (rank representation + monotone Lipschitz scalarization), and construct a minimal operator.

Result: Show that widely used operators intrinsically fail stability, while the proposed operator satisfies axioms and demonstrates non-trivial constraints empirically.

Conclusion: Results delineate design space for valid rank-based normalization, formally separating it from existing differentiable sorting methods.

Abstract: Rank-based input normalization is a workhorse of modern machine learning, prized for its robustness to scale, monotone transformations, and batch-to-batch variation. In many real systems, the ordering of feature values matters far more than their raw magnitudes - yet the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under these invariances have never been formally pinned down.
  We show that widely used differentiable sorting and ranking operators fundamentally fail these criteria. Because they rely on value gaps and batch-level pairwise interactions, they are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, shifts in mini-batch composition, and even tiny input perturbations. Crucially, these failures stem from the operators' structural design, not from incidental implementation choices.
  To address this, we propose three axioms that formalize the minimal invariance and stability properties required of rank-based input normalization. We prove that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into (i) a feature-wise rank representation and (ii) a scalarization map that is both monotone and Lipschitz-continuous. We then construct a minimal operator that meets these criteria and empirically show that the resulting constraints are non-trivial in realistic setups. Together, our results sharply delineate the design space of valid rank-based normalization operators and formally separate them from existing continuous-relaxation-based sorting methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of over 2,500 AV crash records from NHTSA using a two-stage data mining framework (K-means and ARM) to identify crash dynamics and patterns across SAE Levels 2 and 4, providing guidance for AV safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated Vehicles (AV) can reduce human errors but recent crash data shows safety deviations in mixed traffic. Past studies are limited by small, California-centric datasets and lack focus on various SAE automation levels, highlighting the need for broader analysis.

Method: This study uses a two-stage data mining framework on NHTSA data: first, K-means clustering to segment crashes into 4 behavioral clusters based on temporal, spatial, and environmental features; then, Association Rule Mining (ARM) to extract multivariate relationships between crash patterns and factors like lighting, surface condition, and vehicle dynamics.

Result: The analysis of 2,500+ AV crash records uncovers distinct crash dynamics and patterns across SAE Levels 2 and 4. Clustering identifies four behavioral groups, and ARM reveals key relationships (e.g., linking lighting conditions or surface conditions to specific crash patterns), providing insights into crash contributors.

Conclusion: The study offers actionable insights for AV developers, safety regulators, and policymakers to improve AV deployment strategies and minimize crash risks, while emphasizing the importance of considering diverse SAE levels and factors in enhancing operational reliability in mixed traffic.

Abstract: Automated Vehicles (AV) hold potential to reduce or eliminate human driving errors, enhance traffic safety, and support sustainable mobility. Recently, crash data has increasingly revealed that AV behavior can deviate from expected safety outcomes, raising concerns about the technology's safety and operational reliability in mixed traffic environments. While past research has investigated AV crash, most studies rely on small-size California-centered datasets, with a limited focus on understanding crash trends across various SAE Levels of automation. This study analyzes over 2,500 AV crash records from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), covering SAE Levels 2 and 4, to uncover underlying crash dynamics. A two-stage data mining framework is developed. K-means clustering is first applied to segment crash records into 4 distinct behavioral clusters based on temporal, spatial, and environmental factors. Then, Association Rule Mining (ARM) is used to extract interpretable multivariate relationships between crash patterns and crash contributors including lighting conditions, surface condition, vehicle dynamics, and environmental conditions within each cluster. These insights provide actionable guidance for AV developers, safety regulators, and policymakers in formulating AV deployment strategies and minimizing crash risks.

*Guikun Xu,Xiaohan Yi,Peilin Zhao,Yatao Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EnFlow uses flow matching with energy guidance to generate accurate low-energy molecular conformer ensembles and identify ground-state structures efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based methods for generating conformer ensembles either lack energy calibration (generative models) or fail to represent variability (deterministic predictors).

Method: Couples flow matching with a learned energy model via energy-guided sampling along a non-Gaussian FM path, incorporating energy-gradient guidance to steer trajectories toward lower-energy regions.

Result: Improves generation metrics with few steps and reduces ground-state prediction errors on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs datasets.

Conclusion: EnFlow provides a unified framework that enhances conformational diversity and accuracy for efficient ground-state identification.

Abstract: Generating low-energy conformer ensembles and identifying ground-state conformations from molecular graphs remain computationally demanding with physics-based pipelines. Current learning-based approaches often suffer from a fragmented paradigm: generative models capture diversity but lack reliable energy calibration, whereas deterministic predictors target a single structure and fail to represent ensemble variability. Here we present EnFlow, a unified framework that couples flow matching (FM) with an explicitly learned energy model through an energy-guided sampling scheme defined along a non-Gaussian FM path. By incorporating energy-gradient guidance during sampling, our method steers trajectories toward lower-energy regions, substantially improving conformational fidelity, particularly in the few-step regime. The learned energy function further enables efficient energy-based ranking of generated ensembles for accurate ground-state identification. Extensive experiments on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs demonstrate that EnFlow simultaneously improves generation metrics with 1--2 ODE-steps and reduces ground-state prediction errors compared with state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, with their unique blockchain features and high price volatility, attract significant investment, creating demand for effective price forecasting methods.

Method: The proposed PGRU model employs parallel gated recurrent units with independent inputs of different price features, combined via a neural network to predict future prices.

Result: The model achieves MAPE scores of 3.243% (window length 20) and 2.641% (window length 15), outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency with reduced data and lower computational cost.

Conclusion: PGRU offers a superior approach for cryptocurrency price prediction, demonstrating enhanced performance and practicality for investment applications.

Abstract: According to the advent of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, many investments and businesses are now conducted online through cryptocurrencies. Among them, Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to make transactions secure, transparent, traceable, and immutable. It also exhibits significant price fluctuations and performance, which has attracted substantial attention, especially in financial sectors. Consequently, a wide range of investors and individuals have turned to investing in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most important challenges in economics is price forecasting for future trades. Cryptocurrencies are no exception, and investors are looking for methods to predict prices; various theories and methods have been proposed in this field. This paper presents a new deep model, called \emph{Parallel Gated Recurrent Units} (PGRU), for cryptocurrency price prediction. In this model, recurrent neural networks forecast prices in a parallel and independent way. The parallel networks utilize different inputs, each representing distinct price-related features. Finally, the outputs of the parallel networks are combined by a neural network to forecast the future price of cryptocurrencies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 3.243% and 2.641% for window lengths 20 and 15, respectively. Our method therefore attains higher accuracy and efficiency with fewer input data and lower computational cost compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: This paper presents an AI-based algorithm for daily and monthly gold price forecasting using LSTM networks integrated with MLPs, optimized by GWO, achieving significant returns and low error metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting of the global gold market is challenging due to economic and political complexities, making a reliable prediction model valuable for developers and investors.

Method: Uses two LSTM networks for daily and monthly forecasting, integrates results via MLP, optimizes neuron numbers with Gray Wolf Optimization based on RMSE error, and incorporates macroeconomic, energy, stock, and currency data from 2010-2021.

Result: The model achieved a 171% return in three months through a developed trading strategy, with daily closing price MAE of $0.21 and monthly price MAE of $22.23.

Conclusion: The proposed LSTM-MLP model effectively predicts gold prices with high accuracy and profitability, demonstrating its potential for market applications and benefit to stakeholders.

Abstract: The global gold market, by its fundamentals, has long been home to many financial institutions, banks, governments, funds, and micro-investors. Due to the inherent complexity and relationship between important economic and political components, accurate forecasting of financial markets has always been challenging. Therefore, providing a model that can accurately predict the future of the markets is very important and will be of great benefit to their developers. In this paper, an artificial intelligence-based algorithm for daily and monthly gold forecasting is presented. Two Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are responsible for daily and monthly forecasting, the results of which are integrated into a Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) network and provide the final forecast of the next day prices. The algorithm forecasts the highest, lowest, and closing prices on the daily and monthly time frame. Based on these forecasts, a trading strategy for live market trading was developed, according to which the proposed model had a return of 171% in three months. Also, the number of internal neurons in each network is optimized by the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm based on the least RMSE error. The dataset was collected between 2010 and 2021 and includes data on macroeconomic, energy markets, stocks, and currency status of developed countries. Our proposed LSTM-MLP model predicted the daily closing price of gold with the Mean absolute error (MAE) of $ 0.21 and the next month's price with $ 22.23.

*Tomas Ortega,Chun-Yin Huang,Xiaoxiao Li,Hamid Jafarkhani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two new communication-efficient FL frameworks using biased compression without client-side state or privacy-violating control variates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of communication bottleneck in FL, especially uplink cost in edge settings. Biased compression techniques need error feedback, but existing approaches violate privacy or require client state, unsuited for stateless clients.

Method: CAFe uses previous aggregated update as a shared control variate. CAFe-S extends this using server's small private dataset to generate a more accurate predictor.

Result: CAFe and CAFe-S outperform existing compression schemes, with CAFe proven superior to DCGD in non-convex settings. CAFe-S convergence improves with server data representativeness.

Conclusion: CAFe and CAFe-S present effective solutions to improve communication efficiency in FL by eliminating client-side state while maintaining convergence guarantees, offering practical advantages for large-scale implementations.

Abstract: Distributed learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), faces a significant bottleneck in the communication cost, particularly the uplink transmission of client-to-server updates, which is often constrained by asymmetric bandwidth limits at the edge. Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority of our approaches over existing compression schemes.

TL;DR: Selective TTS improves multi-stage LLM agent tasks by distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches, increasing insight quality under fixed compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-stage pipeline tasks often lack verifiable rewards or sufficient training data, causing judge drift and error accumulation in traditional iterative refinement.

Method: Proposes Selective TTS, a process-based framework that scales inference across stages in multi-agent pipelines, uses process-specific judges for early pruning, and is applied to a data science pipeline for chart generation.

Result: In a data science task, Selective TTS increases mean insight scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance, with an LLM-based judge model aligned with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55).

Conclusion: Selective TTS mitigates judge drift and stabilizes refinement, offering a step toward scaling complex open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards like scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can increasingly automate complex reasoning through Test-Time Scaling (TTS), iterative refinement guided by reward signals. However, many real-world tasks involve multi-stage pipeline whose final outcomes lack verifiable rewards or sufficient data to train robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulate error over stages. We propose Selective TTS, a process-based refinement framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipeline, instead of repeated refinement over time by prior work. By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance. We hope our findings serve as the first step toward to scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, such as scientific discovery and story generation.

TL;DR: A decentralized multi-task representation learning method using a low-rank feature matrix, with a new algorithm offering improved communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized representation learning is well-studied, but decentralized methods are underexplored, especially in data-scarce multi-task settings where tasks are distributed across nodes with limited communication.

Method: An alternating projected gradient and minimization algorithm to recover a low-rank feature matrix, with theoretical guarantees on performance.

Result: The algorithm provides provable guarantees, with communication complexity independent of target accuracy, reducing costs. Numerical simulations validate it across dimensions and network topologies, showing cases where it outperforms centralized federated learning.

Conclusion: Decentralized multi-task representation learning with low-rank structures is feasible and can be more efficient than centralized approaches in certain regimes, as demonstrated by the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Representation learning is a widely adopted framework for learning in data-scarce environments, aiming to extract common features from related tasks. While centralized approaches have been extensively studied, decentralized methods remain largely underexplored. We study decentralized multi-task representation learning in which the features share a low-rank structure. We consider multiple tasks, each with a finite number of data samples, where the observations follow a linear model with task-specific parameters. In the decentralized setting, task data are distributed across multiple nodes, and information exchange between nodes is constrained by a communication network. The goal is to recover the underlying feature matrix whose rank is much smaller than both the parameter dimension and the number of tasks. We propose a new alternating projected gradient and minimization algorithm with provable accuracy guarantees. We provide comprehensive characterizations of the time, communication, and sample complexities. Importantly, the communication complexity is independent of the target accuracy, which significantly reduces communication cost compared to prior methods. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis across different dimensions and network topologies, and demonstrate regimes in which decentralized learning outperforms centralized federated approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using p-adic numbers as an alternative field to real numbers for machine learning, focusing on their hierarchical structure for representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real numbers are the standard in machine learning, but p-adic numbers offer a hierarchical and non-archimedean structure that could be better suited for tasks like code theory and hierarchical representation learning.

Method: The authors study the p-adic numbers, develop theoretical building blocks for classification, regression, and representation learning, and propose learning models and algorithms based on this framework.

Result: The paper shows that p-adic numbers enable compact representations, such as modeling Quillian semantic networks as p-adic linear networks, which is not possible with real numbers.

Conclusion: P-adic numbers provide a viable and novel alternative to real numbers in machine learning, with potential applications in hierarchical tasks, and the paper identifies open problems for future research.

Abstract: Existing machine learning frameworks operate over the field of real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) and learn representations in real (Euclidean or Hilbert) vector spaces (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^d$). Their underlying geometric properties align well with intuitive concepts such as linear separability, minimum enclosing balls, and subspace projection; and basic calculus provides a toolbox for learning through gradient-based optimization.
  But is this the only possible choice? In this paper, we study the suitability of a radically different field as an alternative to $\mathbb{R}$ -- the ultrametric and non-archimedean space of $p$-adic numbers, $\mathbb{Q}_p$. The hierarchical structure of the $p$-adics and their interpretation as infinite strings make them an appealing tool for code theory and hierarchical representation learning. Our exploratory theoretical work establishes the building blocks for classification, regression, and representation learning with the $p$-adics, providing learning models and algorithms. We illustrate how simple Quillian semantic networks can be represented as a compact $p$-adic linear network, a construction which is not possible with the field of reals. We finish by discussing open problems and opportunities for future research enabled by this new framework.

Conclusion: The framework effectively predicts outages, with LSTM as the top model, highlighting the importance of socio-economic and infrastructure factors in mitigating outage risks during extreme conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting power outages caused by extreme events. The proposed approach specifically targets low-probability, high-consequence outage scenarios and leverages a comprehensive set of features derived from publicly available data sources. We integrate EAGLE-I outage records (2014-2024) with weather, socio-economic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals underlying patterns of community vulnerability and provides a clearer understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) are evaluated. Experimental validation is performed on a large-scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves the lowest prediction error. Additionally, the results demonstrate that stronger economic conditions and more developed infrastructure are associated with lower outage occurrence.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes deep learning architectures for time series forecasting, emphasizing foundational principles like locality and globality over specific layers, and critiques benchmarking practices while proposing a forecasting model card for better design characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of conflicting deep learning architectures for time series forecasting makes it hard to assess which components truly improve performance, necessitating a clear understanding of design principles to guide effective model development.

Method: The study discusses design dimensions and trade-offs in time series forecasting models, analyzes how locality and globality apply to recent architectures, and examines implementation details that impact empirical results and method classification.

Result: Simple, well-designed forecasting architectures can match state-of-the-art performance, and overlooked implementation details significantly alter forecasting methods and empirical outcomes, highlighting the need for improved benchmarking and foundational focus.

Conclusion: Rethinking benchmarking practices and prioritizing foundational aspects of forecasting are essential; an auxiliary forecasting model card is proposed to characterize architectures based on key design choices, promoting more systematic evaluation and design.

Abstract: Deep learning models have grown increasingly popular in time series applications. However, the large quantity of newly proposed architectures, together with often contradictory empirical results, makes it difficult to assess which components contribute significantly to final performance. We aim to make sense of the current design space of deep learning architectures for time series forecasting by discussing the design dimensions and trade-offs that can explain, often unexpected, observed results. This paper discusses the necessity of grounding model design on principles for forecasting groups of time series and how such principles can be applied to current models. In particular, we assess how concepts such as locality and globality apply to recent forecasting architectures. We show that accounting for these aspects can be more relevant for achieving accurate results than adopting specific sequence modeling layers and that simple, well-designed forecasting architectures can often match the state of the art. We discuss how overlooked implementation details in existing architectures (1) fundamentally change the class of the resulting forecasting method and (2) drastically affect the observed empirical results. Our results call for rethinking current faulty benchmarking practices and the need to focus on the foundational aspects of the forecasting problem when designing architectures. As a step in this direction, we propose an auxiliary forecasting model card, whose fields serve to characterize existing and new forecasting architectures based on key design choices.

### [127] [FoldAct: Efficient and Stable Context Folding for Long-Horizon Search Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22733)
*Jiaqi Shao,Yufeng Miao,Wei Zhang,Bing Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FoldAct, a framework to address challenges in long-horizon RL for LLMs with context folding, preventing training collapse and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing context folding methods treat summary actions as standard actions, causing non-stationary observation distributions that violate RL assumptions, leading to issues like gradient dilution, self-conditioning, and high computational cost.

Method: FoldAct uses three innovations: separated loss computation for independent gradients on summary and action tokens, full context consistency loss to reduce distribution shift, and selective segment training to cut computational costs.

Result: The method enables stable training of long-horizon search agents, addresses the non-stationary observation problem, and achieves significant efficiency gains.

Conclusion: FoldAct effectively tackles fundamental challenges in long-horizon RL with context folding, offering a robust solution for scalable training with enhanced stability and performance.

Abstract: Long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models faces critical scalability challenges from unbounded context growth, leading to context folding methods that compress interaction history during task execution. However, existing approaches treat summary actions as standard actions, overlooking that summaries fundamentally modify the agent's future observation space, creating a policy-dependent, non-stationary observation distribution that violates core RL assumptions. This introduces three fundamental challenges: (1) gradient dilution where summary tokens receive insufficient training signal, (2) self-conditioning where policy updates change summary distributions, creating a vicious cycle of training collapse, and (3) computational cost from processing unique contexts at each turn. We introduce \textbf{FoldAct}\footnote{https://github.com/SHAO-Jiaqi757/FoldAct}, a framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through three key innovations: separated loss computation for independent gradient signals on summary and action tokens, full context consistency loss to reduce distribution shift, and selective segment training to reduce computational cost. Our method enables stable training of long-horizon search agents with context folding, addressing the non-stationary observation problem while improving training efficiency with 5.19$\times$ speedup.

### [128] [When Does Multi-Task Learning Fail? Quantifying Data Imbalance and Task Independence in Metal Alloy Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22740)
*Sungwoo Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-task learning (MTL) for alloy property prediction shows a dichotomy: improves classification but hurts regression due to data imbalance and property independence, recommending separate models for each.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if MTL leverages shared physics among related alloy properties (electrical resistivity, Vickers hardness, amorphous-forming ability) for better predictions.

Method: Comparing single-task models against standard and structured MTL using 54,028 alloy samples to simultaneously predict the three properties.

Result: MTL significantly degrades regression performance (e.g., resistivity R² from 0.897 to 0.844) but improves classification (amorphous F1 from 0.703 to 0.744), with near-zero inter-task weights indicating property independence and regression failure due to severe data imbalance (52k vs. 800 samples).

Conclusion: Recommend independent models for precise regression tasks and reserve MTL for classification where recall is critical, as properties are largely independent and MTL suffers from negative transfer in imbalanced data.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) assumes related material properties share underlying physics that can be leveraged for better predictions. We test this by simultaneously predicting electrical resistivity, Vickers hardness, and amorphous-forming ability using 54,028 alloy samples. We compare single-task models against standard and structured MTL. Results reveal a striking dichotomy: MTL significantly degrades regression performance (resistivity $R^2$: 0.897 $\to$ 0.844; hardness $R^2$: 0.832 $\to$ 0.694, $p < 0.01$) but improves classification (amorphous F1: 0.703 $\to$ 0.744, $p < 0.05$; recall +17%). Analysis shows near-zero inter-task weights, indicating property independence. Regression failure is attributed to negative transfer caused by severe data imbalance (52k vs. 800 samples). We recommend independent models for precise regression, while reserving MTL for classification tasks where recall is critical.

*Rihong Qiu,Zhibang Yang,Xinke Jiang,Weibin Liao,Xin Gao,Xu Chu,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HEROSQL is a method for semantic validation in Text-to-SQL systems using hierarchical representations and NMPNN to detect misalignments between questions and SQL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-SQL validation approaches focus on syntactic correctness, leaving key challenges in semantic validation: capturing global intent and SQL details, and obtaining quality fine-grained annotations.

Method: Introduces HEROSQL with hierarchical SQL representation (Logical Plans for intent, Abstract Syntax Trees for details), NMPNN for information propagation, and AST-driven sub-SQL augmentation for negative samples.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks, with average improvements of 9.40% AUPRC and 12.35% AUROC in detecting semantic inconsistencies, excelling at fine-grained error detection.

Conclusion: HEROSQL enhances reliability and interpretability of data querying platforms by providing granular feedback, addressing semantic validation challenges effectively compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL translates natural language questions into SQL statements grounded in a target database schema. Ensuring the reliability and executability of such systems requires validating generated SQL, but most existing approaches focus only on syntactic correctness, with few addressing semantic validation (detecting misalignments between questions and SQL). As a consequence, effective semantic validation still faces two key challenges: capturing both global user intent and SQL structural details, and constructing high-quality fine-grained sub-SQL annotations. To tackle these, we introduce HEROSQL, a hierarchical SQL representation approach that integrates global intent (via Logical Plans, LPs) and local details (via Abstract Syntax Trees, ASTs). To enable better information propagation, we employ a Nested Message Passing Neural Network (NMPNN) to capture inherent relational information in SQL and aggregate schema-guided semantics across LPs and ASTs. Additionally, to generate high-quality negative samples, we propose an AST-driven sub-SQL augmentation strategy, supporting robust optimization of fine-grained semantic inconsistencies. Extensive experiments conducted on Text-to-SQL validation benchmarks (both in-domain and out-of-domain settings) demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average 9.40% improvement of AUPRC and 12.35% of AUROC in identifying semantic inconsistencies. It excels at detecting fine-grained semantic errors, provides large language models with more granular feedback, and ultimately enhances the reliability and interpretability of data querying platforms.

*Rui Ai,David Simchi-Levi,Feng Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops an efficient algorithm for third-party platforms to learn demand despite confounding from strategic agents, with optimal regret. It shows supply-side noise affects learnability, uses non-i.i.d. actions as instrumental variables, introduces a novel homeomorphic construction for deep neural networks, and validates results with simulations and real data from Zomato and Lyft.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Third-party platforms face revenue maximization but must infer demand from observable equilibrium prices and quantities, which is confounded by strategic agents, creating a general demand learning problem.

Method: Mathematically develop an algorithm with optimal regret of Õ(√T ∧ σ_S^{-2}), use non-i.i.d. actions as instrumental variables, and propose a homeomorphic construction to avoid star-shapedness assumptions for deep neural network estimation.

Result: The algorithm achieves optimal regret, demonstrating a phase transition in regret due to supply-side noise, and successfully learns demand with efficiency guarantees for deep neural networks.

Conclusion: Supply-side noise fundamentally impacts demand learnability; non-i.i.d. actions and homeomorphic methods enable effective demand learning with deep neural networks, proven practical in simulations and real-world data from Zomato and Lyft.

Abstract: We study the pricing behavior of third-party platforms facing strategic agents. Assuming the platform is a revenue maximizer, it observes market features that generally affect demand. Since only the equilibrium price and quantity are observable, this presents a general demand learning problem under confounding. Mathematically, we develop an algorithm with optimal regret of $\Tilde{\cO}(\sqrt{T}\wedgeσ_S^{-2})$. Our results reveal that supply-side noise fundamentally affects the learnability of demand, leading to a phase transition in regret. Technically, we show that non-i.i.d. actions can serve as instrumental variables for learning demand. We also propose a novel homeomorphic construction that allows us to establish estimation bounds without assuming star-shapedness, providing the first efficiency guarantee for learning demand with deep neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach through simulations and real-world data from Zomato and Lyft.

### [131] [A Micro-Macro Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Childhood Obesity Risk Using NHANES and Environmental Determinants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22758)
*Eswarasanthosh Kumar Mamillapalli,Nishtha Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A micro-macro ML framework integrates individual and environmental data to predict childhood obesity, identifying high-risk areas for public health action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional studies treat individual and environmental risk factors separately, missing their interactions in childhood obesity, a major U.S. public health issue.

Method: Uses NHANES microdata and macro-level features from USDA/EPA to train models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) and creates EnvScore for environmental vulnerability at state level.

Result: XGBoost performed best; multi-level analysis shows geographic overlap between high environmental burden states and predicted obesity risk, indicating environment-driven disparities.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable pipeline for public health informatics, with potential for causal modeling and interventions to address obesity inequalities.

Abstract: Childhood obesity remains a major public health challenge in the United States, strongly influenced by a combination of individual-level, household-level, and environmental-level risk factors. Traditional epidemiological studies typically analyze these levels independently, limiting insights into how structural environmental conditions interact with individual-level characteristics to influence health outcomes. In this study, we introduce a micro-macro machine learning framework that integrates (1) individual-level anthropometric and socioeconomic data from NHANES and (2) macro-level structural environment features, including food access, air quality, and socioeconomic vulnerability extracted from USDA and EPA datasets. Four machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained to predict obesity using NHANES microdata. XGBoost achieved the strongest performance. A composite environmental vulnerability index (EnvScore) was constructed using normalized indicators from USDA and EPA at the state level. Multi-level comparison revealed strong geographic similarity between states with high environmental burden and the nationally predicted micro-level obesity risk distribution. This demonstrates the feasibility of integrating multi-scale datasets to identify environment-driven disparities in obesity risk. This work contributes a scalable, data-driven, multi-level modeling pipeline suitable for public health informatics, demonstrating strong potential for expansion into causal modeling, intervention planning, and real-time analytics.

### [132] [Understanding the Mechanisms of Fast Hyperparameter Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22768)
*Nikhil Ghosh,Denny Wu,Alberto Bietti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scale-aware hyperparameter transfer using μP enables efficient large model optimization by decomposing training into width-stable and width-sensitive components, providing computational advantages over direct tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prohibitive cost of standard hyperparameter optimization for large-scale deep learning models necessitates more efficient approaches.

Method: Conceptual framework for HP transfer analysis, formal proof of transfer efficiency equivalence, empirical validation through synthetic and real-world experiments including LLM pretraining.

Result: Fast HP transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal search; μP enables fast transfer in practice due to decomposition of optimization trajectory into stable and sensitive components.

Conclusion: Scale-aware hyperparameter transfer via μP offers a promising approach for efficient large-scale model optimization, with demonstrated practical benefits despite theoretical limitations.

Abstract: The growing scale of deep learning models has rendered standard hyperparameter (HP) optimization prohibitively expensive. A promising solution is the use of scale-aware hyperparameters, which can enable direct transfer of optimal HPs from small-scale grid searches to large models with minimal performance loss. To understand the principles governing such transfer strategy, we develop a general conceptual framework for reasoning about HP transfer across scale, characterizing transfer as fast when the suboptimality it induces vanishes asymptotically faster than the finite-scale performance gap. We show formally that fast transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search, meaning that transfer is asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning. While empirical work has found that the Maximal Update Parameterization ($μ$P) exhibits fast transfer when scaling model width, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that this property depends critically on problem structure by presenting synthetic settings where transfer either offers provable computational advantage or fails to outperform direct tuning even under $μ$P. To explain the fast transfer observed in practice, we conjecture that decomposing the optimization trajectory reveals two contributions to loss reduction: (1) a width-stable component that determines the optimal HPs, and (2) a width-sensitive component that improves with width but weakly perturbs the HP optimum. We present empirical evidence for this hypothesis across various settings, including large language model pretraining.

*Xuyan Li,Jie Wang,Zheng Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A paper introducing GRExplainer, a universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) that addresses limitations in existing TGNN explainability approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TGNN explainability methods are limited by specificity to TGNN types, high computational costs, and lack of user-friendliness, hindering practical adoption of TGNNs.

Method: GRExplainer uses node sequences as a unified feature representation, independent of input formats, constructed via breadth-first search and temporal information, and employs an RNN-based generative model for automated, continuous explanation generation.

Result: Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs demonstrate that GRExplainer outperforms baselines in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.

Conclusion: GRExplainer effectively addresses key issues in TGNN explainability, offering a universal, efficient, and user-friendly solution that enhances the practical utility of TGNNs.

Abstract: Dynamic graphs are widely used to represent evolving real-world networks. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing such graphs, but the lack of transparency and explainability limits their practical adoption. Research on TGNN explainability is still in its early stages and faces several key issues: (i) Current methods are tailored to specific TGNN types, restricting generality. (ii) They suffer from high computational costs, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. (iii) They often overlook the structural connectivity of explanations and require prior knowledge, reducing user-friendliness. To address these issues, we propose GRExplainer, the first universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for TGNNs. GRExplainer extracts node sequences as a unified feature representation, making it independent of specific input formats and thus applicable to both snapshot-based and event-based TGNNs (the major types of TGNNs). By utilizing breadth-first search and temporal information to construct input node sequences, GRExplainer reduces redundant computation and improves efficiency. To enhance user-friendliness, we design a generative model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling automated and continuous explanation generation. Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs show that GRExplainer outperforms existing baseline methods in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.

TL;DR: Schrödinger AI is a unified ML framework based on quantum mechanics, using wave-energy and dynamical solvers with operator calculus for robust generalization, interpretability, and dynamic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an alternative to conventional cross-entropy training and transformer attention by leveraging quantum-inspired principles for better generalization, semantics, and adaptability.

Method: Consists of three coupled components: time-independent wave-energy solver for perception via spectral decomposition, time-dependent dynamical solver for evolution of semantic wavefunctions, and low-rank operator calculus for learning symbolic transformations.

Result: Empirical demonstrations show emergent semantic manifolds matching class relations, dynamic reasoning in changing environments like maze navigation, and exact operator generalization on modular arithmetic tasks beyond training lengths.

Conclusion: Suggests a new foundational direction for ML where learning involves discovering and navigating semantic energy landscapes, offering robust and interpretable AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Schrödinger AI}, a unified machine learning framework inspired by quantum mechanics. The system is defined by three tightly coupled components: (1) a {time-independent wave-energy solver} that treats perception and classification as spectral decomposition under a learned Hamiltonian; (2) a {time-dependent dynamical solver} governing the evolution of semantic wavefunctions over time, enabling context-aware decision revision, re-routing, and reasoning under environmental changes; and (3) a {low-rank operator calculus} that learns symbolic transformations such as modular arithmetic through learned quantum-like transition operators. Together, these components form a coherent physics-driven alternative to conventional cross-entropy training and transformer attention, providing robust generalization, interpretable semantics, and emergent topology.
  Empirically, Schrödinger AI demonstrates: (a) emergent semantic manifolds that reflect human-conceived class relations without explicit supervision; (b) dynamic reasoning that adapts to changing environments, including maze navigation with real-time potential-field perturbations; and (c) exact operator generalization on modular arithmetic tasks, where the system learns group actions and composes them across sequences far beyond training length. These results suggest a new foundational direction for machine learning, where learning is cast as discovering and navigating an underlying semantic energy landscape.

TL;DR: Zero-shot compositional generalization via causal transportability theory, using modules learned from source data and composed for target domain with causal structure and discrepancy oracles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generalization across domains without access to target data, leveraging causal structure and mechanism sharing constraints.

Method: Design an algorithm that learns modules from source data and transports/composes them based on causal graph and discrepancy oracles for zero-shot prediction, plus a supervised adaptation scheme with limited target data.

Result: Theoretical characterization of few-shot learnable tasks via graphical criteria and connection to circuit size complexity, supported by simulation validations.

Conclusion: Circuit-TR facilitates domain adaptation and compositional generalization by exploiting causal transportability, offering theoretical and practical insights.

Abstract: Generalization across the domains is not possible without asserting a structure that constrains the unseen target domain w.r.t. the source domain. Building on causal transportability theory, we design an algorithm for zero-shot compositional generalization which relies on access to qualitative domain knowledge in form of a causal graph for intra-domain structure and discrepancies oracle for inter-domain mechanism sharing. \textit{Circuit-TR} learns a collection of modules (i.e., local predictors) from the source data, and transport/compose them to obtain a circuit for prediction in the target domain if the causal structure licenses. Furthermore, circuit transportability enables us to design a supervised domain adaptation scheme that operates without access to an explicit causal structure, and instead uses limited target data. Our theoretical results characterize classes of few-shot learnable tasks in terms of graphical circuit transportability criteria, and connects few-shot generalizability with the established notion of circuit size complexity; controlled simulations corroborate our theoretical results.

TL;DR: Analysis of COVID-19 transmission in China using NLP on public health data to identify regional differences and evolving infection sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand effective public health interventions for COVID-19 by analyzing SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns.

Method: Collect case reports from health commissions, Chinese CDC, and government social media, apply NLP and manual curation for transmission chains, and combine with population mobility data.

Result: Regional differences observed, with larger cities having more infections; 79% symptomatic hospitalized within 5 days; infection sources shifted from travel-related to social activities.

Conclusion: Targeted interventions based on transmission dynamics are crucial, emphasizing early hospitalization and adapting to changing infection sources like social activities.

Abstract: A comprehensive retrospective analysis of public health interventions, such as large scale testing, quarantining, and contact tracing, can help identify mechanisms most effective in mitigating COVID-19. We investigate China based SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns (e.g., infection type and likely transmission source) using publicly released tracking data. We collect case reports from local health commissions, the Chinese CDC, and official local government social media, then apply NLP and manual curation to construct transmission/tracking chains. We further analyze tracking data together with Wuhan population mobility data to quantify and visualize temporal and spatial spread dynamics. Results indicate substantial regional differences, with larger cities showing more infections, likely driven by social activities. Most symptomatic individuals (79\%) were hospitalized within 5 days of symptom onset, and those with confirmed-case contact sought admission in under 5 days. Infection sources also shifted over time: early cases were largely linked to travel to (or contact with travelers from) Hubei Province, while later transmission was increasingly associated with social activities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electronic noses face challenges with feature distribution shifts and unknown interference in open-set gas recognition, where existing Euclidean-based methods fail to handle anisotropic distributions and signal intensity variations.

Method: Proposes SNM-Net with a geometric decoupling mechanism via cascaded batch and L2 normalization to project features onto a unit hypersphere, and uses Mahalanobis distance for adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries, being architecture-agnostic for CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.

Result: On the Vergara dataset, Transformer+SNM achieves near-theoretical performance: AUROC of 0.9977, unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% (TPR at 5% FPR), outperforming state-of-the-art with a 3.0% AUROC improvement and 91.0% standard deviation reduction vs. Class Anchor Clustering.

Conclusion: SNM-Net effectively resolves the accuracy-stability trade-off, providing a robust technical foundation for industrial E-nose deployment with exceptional robustness across sensor positions.

Abstract: Electronic nose (E-nose) systems face dual challenges in open-set gas recognition: feature distribution shifts caused by signal drift and decision failures induced by unknown interference. Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance, failing to adequately account for anisotropic gas feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes SNM-Net, a universal deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition. The core innovation lies in a geometric decoupling mechanism achieved through cascaded batch normalization and L2 normalization, which projects high-dimensional features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Additionally, Mahalanobis distance is introduced as the scoring mechanism, utilizing class-wise statistics to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries. SNM-Net is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with CNN, RNN, and Transformer backbones. Systematic experiments on the Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration attains near-theoretical performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% (TPR at 5% FPR). This performance significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing a 3.0% improvement in AUROC and a 91.0% reduction in standard deviation compared to Class Anchor Clustering. The framework exhibits exceptional robustness across sensor positions with standard deviations below 0.0028. This work effectively resolves the trade-off between accuracy and stability, providing a solid technical foundation for industrial E-nose deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An RL-based distillation framework for diffusion models that improves sample efficiency through reward-guided training and step optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distillation methods in diffusion models rely on fixed losses; this work aims to enhance distillation by formulating it as a policy optimization problem for better alignment with teacher outputs and more efficient sampling.

Method: The framework uses reinforcement learning, treating distillation as a policy optimization problem where the student is trained with rewards based on alignment with teacher outputs, allowing exploration of multiple denoising paths and larger steps.

Result: The method achieves superior performance with fewer inference steps and computational resources, is model-agnostic, and applicable to any diffusion model with suitable reward functions.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-driven distillation offers a general optimization paradigm for efficient diffusion learning, outperforming existing techniques in step reduction and resource usage.

Abstract: Distillation addresses the slow sampling problem in diffusion models by creating models with smaller size or fewer steps that approximate the behavior of high-step teachers. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based distillation framework for diffusion models. Instead of relying on fixed reconstruction or consistency losses, we treat the distillation process as a policy optimization problem, where the student is trained using a reward signal derived from alignment with the teacher's outputs. This RL driven approach dynamically guides the student to explore multiple denoising paths, allowing it to take longer, optimized steps toward high-probability regions of the data distribution, rather than relying on incremental refinements. Our framework utilizes the inherent ability of diffusion models to handle larger steps and effectively manage the generative process. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance with significantly fewer inference steps and computational resources compared to existing distillation techniques. Additionally, the framework is model agnostic, applicable to any type of diffusion models with suitable reward functions, providing a general optimization paradigm for efficient diffusion learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework called Mixture-of-Representations (MoR) is proposed for dynamic per-tensor and sub-tensor quantization, using FP8 and BF16 based on tensor properties to achieve high accuracy with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixed-precision training is key for scaling deep learning, but requires identifying effective methods; this work aims to enable robust low-precision training by dynamically selecting representations to preserve model quality without extensive partitioning.

Method: Develop and experiment with algorithms within the MoR framework that dynamically choose between FP8 and BF16 representations at per-tensor and sub-tensor levels based on numerical properties, designed to be universal across datasets and quantization strategies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.38% of tensors quantized to FP8, showing FP8 accuracies comparable to existing methods without fine-grained partitioning, and suggesting potential for even lower-precision formats like NVFP4.

Conclusion: The MoR framework demonstrates the viability of dynamic, property-aware quantization to preserve model quality and enhance low-precision training robustness, with promising applications in broader contexts and combinations with other methods.

Abstract: Mixed-precision training is a crucial technique for scaling deep learning models, but successful mixedprecision training requires identifying and applying the right combination of training methods. This paper presents our preliminary study on Mixture-of-Representations (MoR), a novel, per-tensor and sub-tensor level quantization framework that dynamically analyzes a tensor's numerical properties to select between a variety of different representations. Based on the framework, we have proposed and experimented concrete algorithms that choose dynamically between FP8 and BF16 representations for both per-tensor and sub-tensor level granularities. Our universal approach is designed to preserve model quality across various quantization partition strategies and datasets. Our initial findings show that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art results with 98.38% of tensors quantized to the FP8 format. This work highlights the potential of dynamic, property-aware quantization while preserving model quality. We believe this approach can generally improve the robustness of low precision training, as demonstrated by achieving FP8 accuracies that are on par with existing approaches without the need for fine-grain partitioning, or can be used in combination with other training methods to improve the leverage of even lower precision number formats such as NVFP4.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'long-range distillation', a method using AI-generated synthetic climate data to train long-timestep probabilistic models for accurate long-range weather forecasting, reducing autoregressive steps and improving skill.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate long-range weather forecasting is challenging due to error accumulation in autoregressive AI models and limited training data from reanalysis datasets for capturing slow climate variability.

Method: The authors propose long-range distillation, where a short-timestep autoregressive 'teacher' model generates a huge synthetic dataset (over 10,000 years of simulated climate), used to train a long-timestep probabilistic 'student' model for direct long-range forecasting.

Result: In perfect-model experiments, distilled models outperform climatology and approach teacher skill while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with one step. Real-world tests show subseasonal-to-seasonal skill comparable to ECMWF ensemble forecasts after ERA5 fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Long-range distillation demonstrates that AI-generated synthetic training data can scale long-range forecast skill, addressing overfitting and improving accuracy beyond current reanalysis limits.

Abstract: Accurate long-range weather forecasting remains a major challenge for AI models, both because errors accumulate over autoregressive rollouts and because reanalysis datasets used for training offer a limited sample of the slow modes of climate variability underpinning predictability. Most AI weather models are autoregressive, producing short lead forecasts that must be repeatedly applied to reach subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) or seasonal lead times, often resulting in instability and calibration issues. Long-timestep probabilistic models that generate long-range forecasts in a single step offer an attractive alternative, but training on the 40-year reanalysis record leads to overfitting, suggesting orders of magnitude more training data are required. We introduce long-range distillation, a method that trains a long-timestep probabilistic "student" model to forecast directly at long-range using a huge synthetic training dataset generated by a short-timestep autoregressive "teacher" model. Using the Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM) as the teacher, we generate over 10,000 years of simulated climate to train distilled student models for forecasting across a range of timescales. In perfect-model experiments, the distilled models outperform climatology and approach the skill of their autoregressive teacher while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with a single timestep. In the real world, they achieve S2S forecast skill comparable to the ECMWF ensemble forecast after ERA5 fine-tuning. The skill of our distilled models scales with increasing synthetic training data, even when that data is orders of magnitude larger than ERA5. This represents the first demonstration that AI-generated synthetic training data can be used to scale long-range forecast skill.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL is inefficient in multi-goal settings; biological systems inspire adaptive learning.

Method: Teacher module prioritizes goals with high temporal variance in Q-function confidence; algorithm-agnostic.

Result: Shows consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across 11 tasks.

Conclusion: Proposed method accelerates learning and offers theoretical insights.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved significant success in solving single-goal tasks. However, uniform goal selection often results in sample inefficiency in multi-goal settings where agents must learn a universal goal-conditioned policy. Inspired by the adaptive and structured learning processes observed in biological systems, we propose a novel Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to accelerate Goal-Conditioned RL. In this framework, the teacher module dynamically prioritizes goals with the highest temporal variance in the policy's confidence score, parameterized by the state-action value (Q) function. The teacher provides an adaptive and focused learning signal by targeting these high-uncertainty goals, fostering continual and efficient progress. We establish a theoretical connection between the temporal variance of Q-values and the evolution of the policy, providing insights into the method's underlying principles. Our approach is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing RL frameworks. We demonstrate this through evaluation across 11 diverse robotic manipulation and maze navigation tasks. The results show consistent and notable improvements over state-of-the-art curriculum learning and goal-selection methods.

### [142] [Fundamental Novel Consistency Theory: $H$-Consistency Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22880)
*Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces H-consistency bounds, which provide stronger guarantees than previous consistency notions like Bayes-consistency or H-calibration, for analyzing the gap between surrogate loss functions optimized in training and target loss functions defining task performance in machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In machine learning, surrogate loss functions (e.g., cross-entropy) are often used during training instead of target loss functions due to computational or differentiability issues, but this can lead to estimation errors; the paper aims to rigorously analyze these errors and provide more informative guarantees.

Method: The study begins with binary classification, establishing tight bounds for convex surrogates and analyzing adversarial settings, then extends to multi-class classification with new bounds for various losses (e.g., max, sum, comp-sum including cross-entropy), develops a framework for deriving bounds, introduces smooth adversarial variants, and examines growth rates and minimizability gaps.

Result: The paper presents novel H-consistency bounds for both binary and multi-class classification, covering non-adversarial and adversarial scenarios, shows some cases where non-trivial bounds are unattainable, derives first bounds for comp-sum losses, and establishes a universal square-root growth rate for smooth surrogates.

Conclusion: These H-consistency bounds offer stronger and more informative guarantees to understand surrogate-target loss discrepancies, with implications for designing robust learning algorithms and guiding surrogate selection based on minimizability gaps.

Abstract: In machine learning, the loss functions optimized during training often differ from the target loss that defines task performance due to computational intractability or lack of differentiability. We present an in-depth study of the target loss estimation error relative to the surrogate loss estimation error. Our analysis leads to $H$-consistency bounds, which are guarantees accounting for the hypothesis set $H$. These bounds offer stronger guarantees than Bayes-consistency or $H$-calibration and are more informative than excess error bounds.
  We begin with binary classification, establishing tight distribution-dependent and -independent bounds. We provide explicit bounds for convex surrogates (including linear models and neural networks) and analyze the adversarial setting for surrogates like $ρ$-margin and sigmoid loss. Extending to multi-class classification, we present the first $H$-consistency bounds for max, sum, and constrained losses, covering both non-adversarial and adversarial scenarios. We demonstrate that in some cases, non-trivial $H$-consistency bounds are unattainable. We also investigate comp-sum losses (e.g., cross-entropy, MAE), deriving their first $H$-consistency bounds and introducing smooth adversarial variants that yield robust learning algorithms.
  We develop a comprehensive framework for deriving these bounds across various surrogates, introducing new characterizations for constrained and comp-sum losses. Finally, we examine the growth rates of $H$-consistency bounds, establishing a universal square-root growth rate for smooth surrogates in binary and multi-class tasks, and analyze minimizability gaps to guide surrogate selection.

*Anqi Mao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies multi-expert deferral and abstention in machine learning with consistency guarantees, covering classification and regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face hallucinations and high costs; deferring uncertain inputs to experts and routing simple queries to smaller models improves reliability and efficiency, motivating multi-expert deferral learning.

Method: Introduce new surrogate losses for abstention and deferral in multi-class classification and regression, analyze score-based and predictor-rejector formulations, single-stage and two-stage settings, with consistency proofs.

Result: Proposed algorithms show superior performance on datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, with strong non-asymptotic consistency guarantees and effective new methods for constant cost functions.

Conclusion: The paper provides comprehensive frameworks with H-consistency bounds for multi-expert deferral, enhancing reliability and efficiency in LLMs and beyond.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance but face critical challenges: hallucinations and high inference costs. Leveraging multiple experts offers a solution: deferring uncertain inputs to more capable experts improves reliability, while routing simpler queries to smaller, distilled models enhances efficiency. This motivates the problem of learning with multiple-expert deferral. This thesis presents a comprehensive study of this problem and the related problem of learning with abstention, supported by strong consistency guarantees.
  First, for learning with abstention (a special case of deferral), we analyze score-based and predictor-rejector formulations in multi-class classification. We introduce new families of surrogate losses and prove strong non-asymptotic, hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees, resolving two existing open questions. We analyze both single-stage and practical two-stage settings, with experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithms.
  Second, we address general multi-expert deferral in classification. We design new surrogate losses for both single-stage and two-stage scenarios and prove they benefit from strong $H$-consistency bounds. For the two-stage scenario, we show that our surrogate losses are realizable $H$-consistent for constant cost functions, leading to effective new algorithms.
  Finally, we introduce a novel framework for regression with deferral to address continuous label spaces. Our versatile framework accommodates multiple experts and various cost structures, supporting both single-stage and two-stage methods. It subsumes recent work on regression with abstention. We propose new surrogate losses with proven $H$-consistency and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the resulting algorithms.

*S. Dai,G. Sun,F. Li,X. Tang,Q. Wang,Y. Cong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated Multi-Task Clustering (FMTC) framework improves spectral clustering in decentralized settings by learning personalized models with shared knowledge without unreliable pseudo-labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spectral clustering models are centralized and inapplicable in decentralized settings, and current federated learning methods suffer from poor generalization due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels and failure to capture latent correlations among heterogeneous clients.

Method: FMTC has two components: client-side personalized clustering module for robust out-of-sample inference, avoiding pseudo-labels; server-side tensorial correlation module to capture shared knowledge across clients using low-rank regularization. Optimization done via an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show FMTC significantly outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.

Conclusion: FMTC successfully addresses limitations of centralized and federated clustering by providing a privacy-preserving framework that enhances performance in decentralized environments with heterogeneous clients.

Abstract: Spectral clustering has emerged as one of the most effective clustering algorithms due to its superior performance. However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.

*Chumeng Liang,Zhanyang Jin,Zahaib Akhtar,Mona Pereira,Haofei Yu,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphLogDebugger uses dynamic graphs to debug tabular logs, outperforming LLMs with a simple dynamic GNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for tabular log debugging rely heavily on LLMs and heavy models, leading to flexibility and scalability issues.

Method: Construct a dynamic graph from tabular log data by representing objects and events as heterogeneous nodes and connecting them with edges, then apply a dynamic GNN.

Result: The framework outperforms LLMs in debugging accuracy, as validated on real-world datasets of computer systems and academic papers.

Conclusion: Dynamic graph modeling with GNNs offers a more efficient, scalable, and effective alternative to LLMs for tabular log debugging.

Abstract: Tabular log abstracts objects and events in the real-world system and reports their updates to reflect the change of the system, where one can detect real-world inconsistencies efficiently by debugging corresponding log entries. However, recent advances in processing text-enriched tabular log data overly depend on large language models (LLMs) and other heavy-load models, thus suffering from limited flexibility and scalability. This paper proposes a new framework, GraphLogDebugger, to debug tabular log based on dynamic graphs. By constructing heterogeneous nodes for objects and events and connecting node-wise edges, the framework recovers the system behind the tabular log as an evolving dynamic graph. With the help of our dynamic graph modeling, a simple dynamic Graph Neural Network (GNN) is representative enough to outperform LLMs in debugging tabular log, which is validated by experimental results on real-world log datasets of computer systems and academic papers.

*Ünver Çiftçi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper proposes Sat-EnQ, a two-phase deep Q-learning framework using satisficing in Phase 1 to stabilize training, then distillation in Phase 2 for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Q-learning algorithms are unstable, especially early in training, due to overestimation from maximization amplifying errors.

Method: Phase 1 trains lightweight Q-network ensemble with satisficing objective to limit early value growth via dynamic baseline, reducing variance. Phase 2 distills ensemble into larger network fine-tuned with Double DQN.

Result: Simulations show Sat-EnQ reduces variance by 3.8x, eliminates catastrophic failures (0% vs 50% in DQN), retains 79% performance under noise, and uses 2.5x less compute than bootstrapped ensembles.

Conclusion: The framework offers a principled approach for robust reinforcement learning by prioritizing satisficing before optimization, enhancing stability and efficiency.

Abstract: Deep Q-learning algorithms remain notoriously unstable, especially during early training when the maximization operator amplifies estimation errors. Inspired by bounded rationality theory and developmental learning, we introduce Sat-EnQ, a two-phase framework that first learns to be ``good enough'' before optimizing aggressively. In Phase 1, we train an ensemble of lightweight Q-networks under a satisficing objective that limits early value growth using a dynamic baseline, producing diverse, low-variance estimates while avoiding catastrophic overestimation. In Phase 2, the ensemble is distilled into a larger network and fine-tuned with standard Double DQN. We prove theoretically that satisficing induces bounded updates and cannot increase target variance, with a corollary quantifying conditions for substantial reduction. Empirically, Sat-EnQ achieves 3.8x variance reduction, eliminates catastrophic failures (0% vs 50% for DQN), maintains 79% performance under environmental noise}, and requires 2.5x less compute than bootstrapped ensembles. Our results highlight a principled path toward robust reinforcement learning by embracing satisficing before optimization.

*Jin Wu,Chanjin Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MetaCD, a meta-learning framework with continual learning for cognitive diagnosis, addressing data long-tailed distribution and dynamic changes to improve accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for cognitive diagnosis are limited by long-tailed data distribution and dynamic changes, affecting performance.

Method: Combines meta-learning for optimal initialization to tackle long-tailed issues and a continual learning parameter protection mechanism to adapt to new skills or tasks.

Result: Outperforms baselines on five real-world datasets in accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: MetaCD enhances model plasticity, stability, and generalization for cognitive diagnosis tasks, effectively addressing data challenges.

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis is an essential research topic in intelligent education, aimed at assessing the level of mastery of different skills by students. So far, many research works have used deep learning models to explore the complex interactions between students, questions, and skills. However, the performance of existing method is frequently limited by the long-tailed distribution and dynamic changes in the data. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework for cognitive diagnosis based on continual learning (MetaCD). This framework can alleviate the long-tailed problem by utilizing meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization state, enabling the model to achieve good accuracy on new tasks with only a small amount of data. In addition, we utilize a continual learning method named parameter protection mechanism to give MetaCD the ability to adapt to new skills or new tasks, in order to adapt to dynamic changes in data. MetaCD can not only improve the plasticity of our model on a single task, but also ensure the stability and generalization of the model on sequential tasks. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that MetaCD outperforms other baselines in both accuracy and generalization.

### [148] [APO: Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22953)
*Wang Zixian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APO introduces an anchored framework using alpha-divergence to interpolate between forward and reverse KL divergences in alignment with a dynamic schedule, enhancing stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods either use forward KL for mode coverage (stable but under-exploitative) or reverse KL for mode-seeking (effective but risk mode collapse), with anchored methods limited to a single divergence.

Method: APO applies Csiszar alpha-divergence within anchored coordinates to create a continuum between forward and reverse KL, with a reward-and-confidence-guided alpha schedule for transition from coverage to exploitation.

Result: Experiments with Qwen3-1.7B on math-level3 show APO achieves competitive performance vs GRPO and GSPO baselines while maintaining training stability.

Conclusion: APO provides a stable, adaptive approach to alignment by dynamically balancing mode coverage and exploitation through alpha-divergence interpolation, improving upon single-divergence methods.

Abstract: Two divergence regimes dominate modern alignment practice. Supervised fine-tuning and many distillation-style objectives implicitly minimize the forward KL divergence KL(q || pi_theta), yielding stable mode-covering updates but often under-exploiting high-reward modes. In contrast, PPO-style online reinforcement learning from human feedback behaves closer to reverse KL divergence KL(pi_theta || q), enabling mode-seeking improvements but risking mode collapse. Recent anchored methods, such as ADPO, show that performing the projection in anchored coordinates can substantially improve stability, yet they typically commit to a single divergence. We introduce Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization (APO), an anchored framework that uses Csiszar alpha-divergence to continuously interpolate between forward and reverse KL behavior within the same anchored geometry. We derive unified gradient dynamics parameterized by alpha, analyze gradient variance properties, and propose a practical reward-and-confidence-guarded alpha schedule that transitions from coverage to exploitation only when the policy is both improving and confidently calibrated. Experiments on Qwen3-1.7B with math-level3 demonstrate that APO achieves competitive performance with GRPO and GSPO baselines while maintaining training stability.

*Vincent Herrmann,Eric Alcaide,Michael Wand,Jürgen Schmidhuber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new metric called Multiple Token Divergence (MTD) measures computational effort in language models without extra training, and Divergence Steering controls text generation complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics like next-token loss don't capture reasoning complexity, and methods based on latent state compressibility can be invasive and unstable.

Method: MTD is defined as the KL divergence between the model's full output distribution and that of a shallow auxiliary prediction head, computed directly from pre-trained models with multiple heads.

Result: MTD effectively distinguishes complex from simple tasks, correlates positively with problem difficulty on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and lower MTD is associated with more accurate reasoning.

Conclusion: MTD provides a practical, lightweight tool for analyzing and steering the computational dynamics of language models through Divergence Steering.

Abstract: Measuring the in-context computational effort of language models is a key challenge, as metrics like next-token loss fail to capture reasoning complexity. Prior methods based on latent state compressibility can be invasive and unstable. We propose Multiple Token Divergence (MTD), a simple measure of computational effort defined as the KL divergence between a model's full output distribution and that of a shallow, auxiliary prediction head. MTD can be computed directly from pre-trained models with multiple prediction heads, requiring no additional training. Building on this, we introduce Divergence Steering, a novel decoding method to control the computational character of generated text. We empirically show that MTD is more effective than prior methods at distinguishing complex tasks from simple ones. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, MTD correlates positively with problem difficulty. Lower MTD is associated with more accurate reasoning. MTD provides a practical, lightweight tool for analyzing and steering the computational dynamics of language models.

### [150] [Trust Region Masking for Long-Horizon LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23075)
*Yingru Li,Jiacai Liu,Jiawei Xu,Yuxuan Tong,Ziniu Li,Baoxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Policy gradient methods in LLM-RL suffer from off-policy mismatch, with prior O(T^2) bounds being vacuous for long sequences. The paper derives tighter O(T) and O(T^{3/2}) bounds based on token-level KL divergence and proposes Trust Region Masking to ensure non-vacuous guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In large language model reinforcement learning (LLM-RL), policy gradient methods optimize a surrogate objective from rollout policy samples. Off-policy mismatch between the rollout and target policies is unavoidable due to factors like implementation divergence and routing discontinuities, leading to approximation error. Classical bounds on this error scale poorly with sequence length, making them ineffective for long-horizon tasks.

Method: The paper derives two new theoretical bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as O(T^{3/2}) and a Mixed bound scaling as O(T), both dependent on maximum token-level KL divergence across sequences. It then proposes Trust Region Masking (TRM), a method that excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, ensuring control over sequence-level divergence.

Result: The derived bounds improve on classical O(T^2) bounds, making them relevant for long sequences. TRM is presented as the first approach to provide non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees in long-horizon LLM-RL, addressing limitations of token-independent methods like PPO clipping.

Conclusion: The paper introduces tighter theoretical bounds for off-policy error in LLM-RL, highlighting the importance of sequence-level token KL divergence. It proposes Trust Region Masking as a practical method to enforce trust regions and achieve guaranteed improvement in long-horizon scenarios, advancing reliability in LLM reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods for large language models optimize a surrogate objective computed from samples of a rollout policy $π_{\text{roll}}$. When $π_{\text{roll}} \ne π_θ$, there is approximation error between the surrogate and the true objective. Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.

*Deyang Zheng,Tianyi Zhang,Wenming Zheng,Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A paper proposes MFMC, a self-supervised learning framework using Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation with a Dual Total Correlation objective to capture higher-order multimodal dependencies in affective computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotional states involve heterogeneous physiological responses across brain and autonomic systems, challenging multimodal learning. Affective annotations are scarce and subjective, making SSL useful, but existing SSL methods rely on pairwise alignment, which fails to capture higher-order interactions among more than two modalities.

Method: Introduces MFMC, a principled SSL framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation objective. It uses a functional maximum correlation analysis-based trace surrogate to optimize a tight sandwich bound, directly capturing joint multimodal interactions without pairwise contrastive losses.

Result: Experiments on three affective computing benchmarks show MFMC achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation. Specific improvements include: CEAP-360VR accuracy increased from 78.9% to 86.8% (subject-dependent) and from 27.5% to 33.1% (subject-independent with EDA signal alone); and within 0.8 percentage points of best method on challenging EEG split of MAHNOB-HCI.

Conclusion: MFMC effectively addresses limitations of pairwise SSL by capturing higher-order multimodal dependencies in affective data, demonstrating robustness to inter-subject variability and advancing representation learning for emotional state analysis.

Abstract: Emotional states manifest as coordinated yet heterogeneous physiological responses across central and autonomic systems, posing a fundamental challenge for multimodal representation learning in affective computing. Learning such joint dynamics is further complicated by the scarcity and subjectivity of affective annotations, which motivates the use of self-supervised learning (SSL). However, most existing SSL approaches rely on pairwise alignment objectives, which are insufficient to characterize dependencies among more than two modalities and fail to capture higher-order interactions arising from coordinated brain and autonomic responses.
  To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), a principled SSL framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation (DTC) objective. By deriving a tight sandwich bound and optimizing it using a functional maximum correlation analysis (FMCA) based trace surrogate, MFMC captures joint multimodal interactions directly, without relying on pairwise contrastive losses.
  Experiments on three public affective computing benchmarks demonstrate that MFMC consistently achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under both subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation protocols, highlighting its robustness to inter-subject variability. In particular, MFMC improves subject-dependent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 78.9% to 86.8%, and subject-independent accuracy from 27.5% to 33.1% using the EDA signal alone. Moreover, MFMC remains within 0.8 percentage points of the best-performing method on the most challenging EEG subject-independent split of MAHNOB-HCI.

### [153] [Taming the Tail: Stable LLM Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Vocabulary Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23087)
*Yingru Li,Jiawei Xu,Jiacai Liu,Yuxuan Tong,Ziniu Li,Tianle Cai,Ge Zhang,Qian Liu,Baoxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the training-inference mismatch in RL for LLMs caused by different probability distributions from inference engines vs. training systems, proposing dynamic vocabulary pruning to exclude low-probability tail tokens for stable training with bounded optimization bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for large language models suffers from a training-inference mismatch where high-throughput inference and precise training systems produce divergent probability distributions from the same parameters, leading to unstable gradient estimation due to accumulated biased mismatches in low-probability tokens.

Method: The paper proposes constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned 'safe' vocabulary that excludes extreme tail tokens, rather than using post-hoc corrections, to trade large, systematically biased mismatches for small, bounded optimization bias.

Result: Empirically, the method achieves stable training by reducing instability from tail token mismatches, and theoretically, it provides bounds on the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning.

Conclusion: Dynamic vocabulary pruning effectively mitigates the training-inference mismatch in RL for LLMs, offering a practical solution that balances optimization bias and training stability, supported by both empirical success and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs) faces a fundamental tension: high-throughput inference engines and numerically-precise training systems produce different probability distributions from the same parameters, creating a training-inference mismatch. We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias. Empirically, our method achieves stable training; theoretically, we bound the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic sleep staging is critical due to global sleep disorder prevalence, but existing single-channel EEG methods face class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and lack of interpretability.

Method: Combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling, uses class-weighted loss and data augmentation for imbalance, segments signals into sub-epochs, and averages softmax probabilities for robustness.

Result: Achieves 89.72% overall accuracy, 85.46% macro-average F1-score, and 61.7% F1-score for N1 stage, outperforming previous methods on SleepEDF datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances sleep staging performance, improves interpretability, and is suitable for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging is a critical task in healthcare due to the global prevalence of sleep disorders. This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets. These results indicate that the proposed approach effectively improves sleep staging performance while maintaining interpretability and suitability for real-world clinical applications.

By analyzing the gradient of a composite objective combining trajectory-level KL divergence with task rewards, we derive a natural decomposition into two components: (1) an analytically computable Dense Gradient for token-level imitation, and (2) a Monte Carlo estimated Sparse Gradient for long-horizon reward optimization. The Dense Gradient admits a closed-form logit-level formula, enabling efficient GPU implementation.

*Tillmann Rheude,Roland Eils,Benjamin Wild*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple late-fusion Transformer baseline (SimBaMM) often matches or outperforms complex multimodal methods under standardized conditions, challenging the need for architectural novelty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question whether increasingly complex multimodal learning architectures genuinely improve performance over simpler approaches, given methodological inconsistencies in prior research.

Method: Reimplement 19 high-impact multimodal methods, standardize experimental conditions, tune hyperparameters rigorously, and test on nine datasets with up to 23 modalities, including tasks beyond original scope and with missing modalities.

Result: SimBaMM, a simple late-fusion Transformer, generally performs comparably to complex methods, which frequently fail to reliably beat well-tuned unimodal baselines, especially in small-data settings.

Conclusion: Advocates shifting focus from architectural novelty to methodological rigor, providing a reliability checklist for future evaluations to ensure comparable and robust results.

Abstract: Deep learning architectures for multimodal learning have increased in complexity, driven by the assumption that multimodal-specific methods improve performance. We challenge this assumption through a large-scale empirical study reimplementing 19 high-impact methods under standardized conditions, evaluating them across nine diverse datasets with up to 23 modalities, and testing their generalizability to new tasks beyond their original scope, including settings with missing modalities. We propose a Simple Baseline for Multimodal Learning (SimBaMM), a straightforward late-fusion Transformer architecture, and demonstrate that under standardized experimental conditions with rigorous hyperparameter tuning of all methods, more complex architectures do not reliably outperform SimBaMM. Statistical analysis indicates that more complex methods perform comparably to SimBaMM and frequently do not reliably outperform well-tuned unimodal baselines, especially in the small-data regime considered in many original studies. To support our findings, we include a case study of a recent multimodal learning method highlighting the methodological shortcomings in the literature. In addition, we provide a pragmatic reliability checklist to promote comparable, robust, and trustworthy future evaluations. In summary, we argue for a shift in focus: away from the pursuit of architectural novelty and toward methodological rigor.

*Paul M. Thompson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes when generative and vision-language models (VLMs) can achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated predictions in biomedicine with practical sample sizes, deriving finite-sample uniform convergence bounds based on low-dimensional semantic representations and Lipschitz stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In biomedical applications, it's critical for model predictions to generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations, not just on average, because rare conditions and specific groups can exhibit large errors even with low overall loss. The study addresses the need to ensure reliability in data-limited settings.

Method: The focus is on induced classifiers from VLMs by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. The analysis assumes smooth dependence on low-dimensional semantic representations, supported by spectral structure in embeddings, and applies classical uniform convergence tools under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings.

Result: The main results provide finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers. Sample complexity depends on intrinsic/effective dimension rather than ambient embedding dimension, with spectrum-dependent bounds explaining how eigenvalue decay governs data requirements.

Conclusion: The findings have implications for data-limited biomedical modeling, indicating when current dataset sizes can support uniformly reliable predictions and highlighting why average calibration metrics may overlook worst-case miscalibration, emphasizing the importance of structural assumptions for practical generalization.

Abstract: Modern generative and vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in scientific and medical decision support, where predicted probabilities must be both accurate and well calibrated. Despite strong empirical results with moderate data, it remains unclear when such predictions generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations, rather than only on average-a critical issue in biomedicine, where rare conditions and specific groups can exhibit large errors even when overall loss is low.
  We study this question from a finite-sample perspective and ask: under what structural assumptions can generative and VLM-based predictors achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated behavior with practical sample sizes? Rather than analyzing arbitrary parameterizations, we focus on induced families of classifiers obtained by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. When model outputs depend smoothly on a low-dimensional semantic representation-an assumption supported by spectral structure in text and joint image-text embeddings-classical uniform convergence tools yield meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees.
  Our main results give finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings. The implied sample complexity depends on intrinsic/effective dimension, not ambient embedding dimension, and we further derive spectrum-dependent bounds that make explicit how eigenvalue decay governs data requirements. We conclude with implications for data-limited biomedical modeling, including when current dataset sizes can support uniformly reliable predictions and why average calibration metrics may miss worst-case miscalibration.

*Fuli Qiao,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel continual learning method for LLMs using LoRA with orthogonal initialization and sequential merging into a single unified LoRA to maintain constant memory and reduce interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LoRA continual learning methods face issues like growing computational memory, limited storage, and task interference due to lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms.

Method: Orthogonally initialize LoRA from previous tasks to learn new tasks, then sequentially merge updates into a unified LoRA using a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance old and new knowledge.

Result: Maintains constant memory complexity, minimizes task interference via orthogonal basis, and improves performance through adaptive asymmetric merging. Validation via theoretical analysis and experiments on diverse benchmarks using Llama models shows effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting and task interference in continual learning for LLMs, offering a scalable and efficient solution with empirical support.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient continual learning has emerged as a promising approach for large language models (LLMs) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) continual learning techniques often retain and freeze previously learned LoRAs or generate data representations to overcome forgetting, typically utilizing these to support new LoRAs learn new tasks. However, these methods not only ignore growing computational memory with tasks and limited storage space but also suffer from potential task interference due to the lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method that orthogonally initializes and sequentially merges LoRAs updates into a single unified LoRA. Our method leverages orthogonal basis extraction from previously learned LoRA to initialize the learning of new tasks, further exploits the intrinsic asymmetry property of LoRA components by using a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance new and old knowledge during continual merging. Our approach maintains constant memory complexity with respect to the number of tasks, minimizes interference between past and new tasks via orthogonal basis initialization, and improves performance over asymmetric LoRA merging via adaptive scaling. We provide theoretical analysis to justify our design and conduct extensive experiments across diverse continual learning benchmarks using various Llama models, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

*Muhammad Haseeb,Salaar Masood,Muhammad Abdullah Sohail*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper uses Mechanistic Interpretability to study why Federated Learning fails under Non-IID data, identifying circuit collapse in FedAvg as the cause.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning under Non-IID data suffers performance drops, but the underlying mechanistic reasons are unclear; the paper aims to diagnose this failure.

Method: Analyze FedAvg with Mechanistic Interpretability, using sparse neural networks to track circuits across clients and compute Intersection-over-Union.

Result: Non-IID data causes structurally distinct local circuits to diverge, leading to degradation in the global model.

Conclusion: The study reframes FL's statistical drift as a concrete failure of mechanistic preservation, enabling more targeted solutions for Non-IID challenges.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of models on decentralized data, but its performance degrades significantly under Non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data conditions. While this accuracy loss is well-documented, the internal mechanistic causes remain a black box. This paper investigates the canonical FedAvg algorithm through the lens of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) to diagnose this failure mode. We hypothesize that the aggregation of conflicting client updates leads to circuit collapse, the destructive interference of functional, sparse sub-networks responsible for specific class predictions. By training inherently interpretable, weight-sparse neural networks within an FL framework, we identify and track these circuits across clients and communication rounds. Using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to quantify circuit preservation, we provide the first mechanistic evidence that Non-IID data distributions cause structurally distinct local circuits to diverge, leading to their degradation in the global model. Our findings reframe the problem of statistical drift in FL as a concrete, observable failure of mechanistic preservation, paving the way for more targeted solutions.

Result: result of this paper

Conclusion: conclusion of this paper

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is challenging due to their limited memory and power resources. Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.

*Min Zhu,Jingmin Sun,Zecheng Zhang,Hayden Schaeffer,Lu Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PI-MFM is a physics-informed multimodal foundation model for learning parametric PDE solution operators, outperforming data-driven methods with sparse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal foundation models for PDEs are data-intensive and ignore physics constraints during training.

Method: PI-MFM inputs symbolic PDE representations, automatically assembles residual losses via vectorized derivative computation, enforcing physics during pretraining and adaptation.

Result: PI-MFM outperforms data-driven models on 13 PDE families, with benefits in sparse data, noise robustness, and zero-shot fine-tuning to unseen families.

Conclusion: PI-MFM offers scalable, data-efficient PDE solvers with physics-informed training.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide range of physical systems, and recent multimodal foundation models have shown promise for learning PDE solution operators across diverse equation families. However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch. These results show that PI-MFM provides a practical and scalable path toward data-efficient, transferable PDE solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PGF enables efficient memory scaling for SSM sensitivity analysis on large genomic sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the O(L) memory scaling bottleneck in gradient-based sensitivity analysis for Selective State Space Models (SSMs), which prevents genomic-scale modeling (L > 10^5) on consumer hardware.

Method: Reframes SSM dynamics as Tiled Operator-Space Evolution (TOSE) to compute exact analytical derivatives directly in the state-space manifold, bypassing the computational graph.

Result: Achieves O(1) memory complexity relative to sequence length, reducing peak VRAM by 94% and increasing throughput 23x compared to standard Autograd, with stable performance across extreme sequences.

Conclusion: PGF enables chromosome-scale sensitivity analysis on a single GPU, bridging theoretical infinite-context models with practical hardware constraints by overcoming memory bottlenecks.

Abstract: Selective State Space Models (SSMs) achieve linear-time inference, yet their gradient-based sensitivity analysis remains bottlenecked by O(L) memory scaling during backpropagation. This memory constraint precludes genomic-scale modeling (L > 10^5) on consumer-grade hardware. We introduce Phase Gradient Flow (PGF), a framework that computes exact analytical derivatives by operating directly in the state-space manifold, bypassing the need to materialize the intermediate computational graph. By reframing SSM dynamics as Tiled Operator-Space Evolution (TOSE), our method delivers O(1) memory complexity relative to sequence length, yielding a 94% reduction in peak VRAM and a 23x increase in throughput compared to standard Autograd. Unlike parallel prefix scans that exhibit numerical divergence in stiff ODE regimes, PGF ensures stability through invariant error scaling, maintaining near-machine precision across extreme sequences. We demonstrate the utility of PGF on an impulse-response benchmark with 128,000-step sequences - a scale where conventional Autograd encounters prohibitive memory overhead, often leading to out-of-memory (OOM) failures in multi-layered models. Our work enables chromosome-scale sensitivity analysis on a single GPU, bridging the gap between theoretical infinite-context models and practical hardware limitations.

TL;DR: ECG-RAMBA separates morphology and rhythm in ECG signals, combines them with context-aware fusion, and introduces Power Mean pooling for robust cross-dataset classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for ECG classification often fails to generalize across datasets due to entangled morphological and rhythmic features, leading to shortcut learning and sensitivity to distribution shifts.

Method: Proposes ECG-RAMBA: extracts morphological features with MiniRocket, computes global rhythm descriptors from HRV, models long-range context via bi-directional Mamba, and fuses with context-aware fusion. Uses Power Mean pooling (Q=3) for windowed inference.

Result: Achieves macro ROC-AUC ≈0.85 on Chapman-Shaoxing, PR-AUC=0.708 for AF detection on CPSC-2021 in zero-shot transfer, and consistent performance on PTB-XL. Outperforms raw-signal Mamba baseline.

Conclusion: Separating morphology and rhythm, then reintegrating them enhances cross-domain robustness; deterministic morphology, explicit rhythm modeling, and long-range context are key drivers.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved strong performance for electrocardiogram (ECG) classification within individual datasets, yet dependable generalization across heterogeneous acquisition settings remains a major obstacle to clinical deployment and longitudinal monitoring. A key limitation of many model architectures is the implicit entanglement of morphological waveform patterns and rhythm dynamics, which can promote shortcut learning and amplify sensitivity to distribution shifts. We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\approx 0.85$. In zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC $=0.708$ for atrial fibrillation detection on the external CPSC-2021 dataset, substantially outperforming a comparable raw-signal Mamba baseline, and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL. Ablation studies indicate that deterministic morphology provides a strong foundation, while explicit rhythm modeling and long-range context are critical drivers of cross-domain robustness.

TL;DR: FLEX-MoE: a federated learning framework for Mixture-of-Experts models that addresses client resource constraints and non-IID data-induced expert load imbalance by jointly optimizing expert assignment and load balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying Mixture-of-Experts models in federated learning faces challenges due to resource-limited edge devices unable to store full expert sets and non-IID data causing severe expert load imbalance, degrading model performance.

Method: The approach introduces client-expert fitness scores based on training feedback to quantify expert suitability for local datasets and uses an optimization-based algorithm to maximize client-expert specialization while ensuring balanced expert utilization across the system.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show FLEX-MoE achieves superior performance and maintains balanced expert utilization in diverse resource-constrained scenarios, addressing the severe utilization skew in heterogeneous FL settings.

Conclusion: FLEX-MoE effectively combines expert assignment and load balancing to enhance federated MoE deployment, overcoming key limitations of traditional greedy methods and improving scalability and performance under non-IID data distributions.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable neural networks through conditional computation. However, their deployment with federated learning (FL) faces two critical challenges: 1) resource-constrained edge devices cannot store full expert sets, and 2) non-IID data distributions cause severe expert load imbalance that degrades model performance. To this end, we propose \textbf{FLEX-MoE}, a novel federated MoE framework that jointly optimizes expert assignment and load balancing under limited client capacity. Specifically, our approach introduces client-expert fitness scores that quantify the expert suitability for local datasets through training feedback, and employs an optimization-based algorithm to maximize client-expert specialization while enforcing balanced expert utilization system-wide. Unlike existing greedy methods that focus solely on personalization while ignoring load imbalance, our FLEX-MoE is capable of addressing the expert utilization skew, which is particularly severe in FL settings with heterogeneous data. Our comprehensive experiments on three different datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed FLEX-MoE, together with its ability to maintain balanced expert utilization across diverse resource-constrained scenarios.

TL;DR: Low-bit quantization (INT8 and W4A8) enhances efficiency of Huawei's openPangu-Embedded LLMs with CoT reasoning on Ascend NPUs, maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT reasoning modes in openPangu-Embedded models increase memory and latency on Ascend NPUs, hindering practical deployment.

Method: Develop a unified low-bit inference framework using INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, optimized for Atlas A2 hardware.

Result: INT8 preserves >90% FP16 accuracy with 1.5x prefill speedup; W4A8 reduces memory but with accuracy trade-offs, validated on code generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Low-bit quantization enables efficient CoT reasoning on Ascend NPUs while maintaining model fidelity, addressing computational constraints.

Abstract: Huawei's openPangu-Embedded-1B and openPangu-Embedded-7B, variants of the openPangu large language model, integrate three distinct Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning paradigms, namely slow_think, auto_think, and no_think. While these CoT modes enhance reasoning capabilities, their generation of extended reasoning traces introduces substantial memory and latency overheads, posing challenges for practical deployment on Ascend NPUs. This paper addresses these computational constraints by leveraging low-bit quantization, which transforms FP16 computations into more efficient integer arithmetic. We introduce a unified low-bit inference framework, supporting INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, specifically optimized for openPangu-Embedded models on the Atlas A2. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across all three CoT modes on code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP), demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. INT8 quantization consistently preserves over 90\% of the FP16 baseline accuracy and achieves a 1.5x prefill speedup on the Atlas A2. Furthermore, W4A8 quantization significantly reduces memory consumption, albeit with a moderate trade-off in accuracy. These findings collectively indicate that low-bit quantization effectively facilitates efficient CoT reasoning on Ascend NPUs, maintaining high model fidelity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) is applied to vision-language models to efficiently adapt them to downstream tasks by reorganizing internal subnetworks via learnable gating scores instead of updating weights, outperforming parameter-efficient methods like LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most fine-tuning approaches for vision-language models rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the underutilized representational structures in pre-trained models. This paper explores structural reparameterization to leverage existing knowledge without altering the backbone.

Method: The paper applies MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs across different language backbones, assigning learnable gating scores to each weight to reorganize internal subnetworks, and compares it against strong PEFT baselines like LoRA and full fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance while keeping the backbone frozen, demonstrating efficient adaptation without weight updates.

Conclusion: Effective adaptation in vision-language models can emerge from reestablishing connections among existing knowledge through structural reparameterization like MFT, offering a powerful alternative to traditional weight-update fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Explorations in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), have made impressive progress. However, most approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. Recent works have demonstrated that Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) can be a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for language models. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we rethink fine-tuning for VLMs from a structural reparameterization perspective grounded in MFT. We apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones and compare against strong PEFT baselines. Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. Our findings reveal that effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unimodal methods ignore log data modalities, while multimodal methods fail to handle interactions between modalities, limiting anomaly detection effectiveness.

Method: Uses collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn modality interactions, with a modality adaptation layer to handle heterogeneity.

Result: Achieves mean precision of 99.63%, recall of 99.59%, and F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for point and collective anomaly detection.

Conclusion: CoLog advances log anomaly detection with a unified framework, effective for cybersecurity and system monitoring, with implementation available.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection is crucial for preserving the security of operating systems. Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses. We also provide the implementation of CoLog at https://github.com/NasirzadehMoh/CoLog.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends neural scaling laws beyond single dense models to familial models, introducing granularity (G) as a scaling variable, showing minimal penalty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical and empirical scaling law for familial models, which enable multiple deployable sub-models from one backbone for heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies.

Method: Proposes unified functional form L(N, D, G), parameterizes it via IsoFLOP experimental design across varied N, G, and D to isolate architectural impacts.

Result: Granularity penalty follows multiplicative power law with very small exponent, maintaining compute-optimality while supporting deployment flexibility.

Conclusion: Validates 'train once, deploy many' paradigm for familial models, bridging fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have become foundational for optimizing large language model (LLM) training, yet they typically assume a single dense model output. This limitation effectively overlooks "Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this "one-run, many-models" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the "train once, deploy many" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.

TL;DR: A method to compress deep neural networks by decoupling solution geometry from ambient search space, enabling significant head compression with minimal performance loss across models like ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models use massive high-dimensional widths to handle non-convex optimization, which is redundant for representation but necessary for finding global minima, making compact networks intractable.

Method: Propose a constructive approach that decouples solution geometry from ambient search space, empirically compressing classification heads by factors up to 16 without significant degradation in performance.

Result: Demonstrated across ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT that classification head compression by factors up to 16 is possible with negligible performance degradation.

Conclusion: This enables Subspace-Native Distillation as a novel paradigm, providing stable geometric coordinates for student models to bypass high-dimensional search, realizing Train Big, Deploy Small.

Abstract: While it is well-established that the weight matrices and feature manifolds of deep neural networks exhibit a low Intrinsic Dimension (ID), current state-of-the-art models still rely on massive high-dimensional widths. This redundancy is not required for representation, but is strictly necessary to solve the non-convex optimization search problem-finding a global minimum, which remains intractable for compact networks. In this work, we propose a constructive approach to bypass this optimization bottleneck. By decoupling the solution geometry from the ambient search space, we empirically demonstrate across ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT that the classification head can be compressed by even huge factors of 16 with negligible performance degradation. This motivates Subspace-Native Distillation as a novel paradigm: by defining the target directly in this constructed subspace, we provide a stable geometric coordinate system for student models, potentially allowing them to circumvent the high-dimensional search problem entirely and realize the vision of Train Big, Deploy Small.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models often suffer from low-quality training data with inductive biases like response length, causing overfitting and reward hacking, while existing debiasing methods are limited to simple linear correlations or single bias types.

Method: Proposes DIR, which uses information bottleneck principles to maximize mutual information between RM scores and human preferences while minimizing it between RM outputs and biased attributes, addressing non-linear and diverse biases.

Result: Experimental validation on biases like response length, sycophancy, and format shows DIR effectively mitigates them, enhances RLHF performance across benchmarks, and improves generalization abilities.

Conclusion: DIR provides a theoretically grounded and practical approach for debiasing reward models, extending applicability to complex real-world scenarios and improving alignment in language models.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RM training data is commonly recognized as low-quality, containing inductive biases that can easily lead to overfitting and reward hacking. For example, more detailed and comprehensive responses are usually human-preferred but with more words, leading response length to become one of the inevitable inductive biases. A limited number of prior RM debiasing approaches either target a single specific type of bias or model the problem with only simple linear correlations, \textit{e.g.}, Pearson coefficients. To mitigate more complex and diverse inductive biases in reward modeling, we introduce a novel information-theoretic debiasing method called \textbf{D}ebiasing via \textbf{I}nformation optimization for \textbf{R}M (DIR). Inspired by the information bottleneck (IB), we maximize the mutual information (MI) between RM scores and human preference pairs, while minimizing the MI between RM outputs and biased attributes of preference inputs. With theoretical justification from information theory, DIR can handle more sophisticated types of biases with non-linear correlations, broadly extending the real-world application scenarios for RM debiasing methods. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of DIR with three types of inductive biases: \textit{response length}, \textit{sycophancy}, and \textit{format}. We discover that DIR not only effectively mitigates target inductive biases but also enhances RLHF performance across diverse benchmarks, yielding better generalization abilities.

*Mario Colosi,Reza Farahani,Maria Fazio,Radu Prodan,Massimo Villari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Osmotic Learning (OSM-L), a self-supervised distributed learning paradigm that extracts higher-level latent knowledge from distributed data without raw data exchange, achieving over 99% accuracy in alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data in distributed systems has deeper significance when contextual relationships are considered, but extracting this latent knowledge without compromising data privacy or integrity is challenging.

Method: OSM-L uses an osmosis process to synthesize dense representations by aligning local data iteratively, enabling information diffusion and convergence into dynamic equilibrium, while also identifying correlated data groups as decentralized clustering.

Result: Experiments show OSM-L converges effectively, achieving over 0.99 accuracy in local information alignment while preserving contextual integrity on structured datasets.

Conclusion: OSM-L is a viable approach for uncovering latent knowledge in distributed systems, offering efficient representation and alignment without raw data exchange, with potential applications in decentralized learning and clustering.

Abstract: Data within a specific context gains deeper significance beyond its isolated interpretation. In distributed systems, interdependent data sources reveal hidden relationships and latent structures, representing valuable information for many applications. This paper introduces Osmotic Learning (OSM-L), a self-supervised distributed learning paradigm designed to uncover higher-level latent knowledge from distributed data. The core of OSM-L is osmosis, a process that synthesizes dense and compact representation by extracting contextual information, eliminating the need for raw data exchange between distributed entities. OSM-L iteratively aligns local data representations, enabling information diffusion and convergence into a dynamic equilibrium that captures contextual patterns. During training, it also identifies correlated data groups, functioning as a decentralized clustering mechanism. Experimental results confirm OSM-L's convergence and representation capabilities on structured datasets, achieving over 0.99 accuracy in local information alignment while preserving contextual integrity.

*Guoan Wan,Tianyu Chen,Fangzheng Feng,Haoyi Zhou,Runhua Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FRoD is a PEFT method that improves efficiency and expressiveness via hierarchical decomposition and rotational freedoms, matching full fine-tuning accuracy with only 1.72% trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods like LoRA struggle with slow convergence and limited adaptation due to low-rank constraints, hindering their ability to handle diverse tasks effectively.

Method: FRoD combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom, extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations for flexible full-rank updates.

Result: On 20 benchmarks across vision, reasoning, and language understanding, FRoD achieves accuracy comparable to full model fine-tuning while using 1.72% of trainable parameters under the same training budget.

Conclusion: FRoD addresses limitations of existing PEFT methods, offering enhanced expressiveness and faster convergence, making it a practical solution for efficient model adaptation.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a practical solution for adapting large foundation models to downstream tasks, reducing computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of parameters. Among them, approaches like LoRA aim to strike a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but often suffer from slow convergence and limited adaptation capacity due to their inherent low-rank constraints. This trade-off hampers the ability of PEFT methods to capture complex patterns needed for diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we propose FRoD, a novel fine-tuning method that combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom. By extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates, FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency, leading to faster and more robust convergence. On 20 benchmarks spanning vision, reasoning, and language understanding, FRoD matches full model fine-tuning in accuracy, while using only 1.72% of trainable parameters under identical training budgets.

### [173] [ML Compass: Navigating Capability, Cost, and Compliance Trade-offs in AI Model Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23487)
*Vassilis Digalakis,Ramayya Krishnan,Gonzalo Martin Fernandez,Agni Orfanoudaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework called ML Compass is introduced to help organizations select AI models by optimizing over a capability-cost frontier, considering user utility, deployment costs, and compliance, rather than relying solely on capability rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face challenges in selecting AI models because traditional capability leaderboards don't account for user utility, deployment costs, and compliance requirements, leading to a gap between model capabilities and practical deployment decisions.

Method: The paper develops ML Compass, which treats model selection as constrained optimization over a capability-cost frontier. It involves theoretical analysis of optimal model configurations under a parametric frontier and an implementation pipeline that extracts internal measures, estimates empirical frontiers, learns utility functions, and recommends models.

Result: ML Compass was validated in two case studies: a conversational setting using the PRISM Alignment dataset and a healthcare setting using HealthBench. It produced recommendations and deployment-aware leaderboards that differ from capability-only rankings, showing how trade-offs in capability, cost, and safety influence optimal model choices.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the capability-deployment gap by providing a systems-level approach for AI model selection, with comparative statics to guide organizational decisions under budget, regulatory, and technological changes.

Abstract: We study how organizations should select among competing AI models when user utility, deployment costs, and compliance requirements jointly matter. Widely used capability leaderboards do not translate directly into deployment decisions, creating a capability -- deployment gap; to bridge it, we take a systems-level view in which model choice is tied to application outcomes, operating constraints, and a capability-cost frontier. We develop ML Compass, a framework that treats model selection as constrained optimization over this frontier. On the theory side, we characterize optimal model configurations under a parametric frontier and show a three-regime structure in optimal internal measures: some dimensions are pinned at compliance minima, some saturate at maximum levels, and the remainder take interior values governed by frontier curvature. We derive comparative statics that quantify how budget changes, regulatory tightening, and technological progress propagate across capability dimensions and costs. On the implementation side, we propose a pipeline that (i) extracts low-dimensional internal measures from heterogeneous model descriptors, (ii) estimates an empirical frontier from capability and cost data, (iii) learns a user- or task-specific utility function from interaction outcome data, and (iv) uses these components to target capability-cost profiles and recommend models. We validate ML Compass with two case studies: a general-purpose conversational setting using the PRISM Alignment dataset and a healthcare setting using a custom dataset we build using HealthBench. In both environments, our framework produces recommendations -- and deployment-aware leaderboards based on predicted deployment value under constraints -- that can differ materially from capability-only rankings, and clarifies how trade-offs between capability, cost, and safety shape optimal model choice.

*Wei Gao,Paul Zheng,Peng Wu,Yulin Hu,Anke Schmeink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel algorithm combining Bayesian optimization and TD3 is developed for joint link adaptation and device scheduling in IIoT networks to maximize transmission rate under URLLC constraints with imperfect CSI, improving convergence and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial IoT networks require multi-device URLLC with strict BLER constraints, but imperfect CSI, error sample imbalance, and TD3 parameter sensitivity can slow convergence and reduce reliability of existing solutions.

Method: Proposes a Bayesian optimization-driven TD3 method that adaptively determines device service order and MCS based on imperfect CSI, enhanced by a BO-based training mechanism for better learning direction and sample selection to address imbalance.

Result: Extensive simulations show the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence and higher sum-rate performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The BO-TD3 approach effectively improves convergence speed and sum-rate in IIoT URLLC scenarios with imperfect CSI, offering a robust solution for joint link adaptation and scheduling.

Abstract: In this article, we consider an industrial internet of things (IIoT) network supporting multi-device dynamic ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) while the channel state information (CSI) is imperfect. A joint link adaptation (LA) and device scheduling (including the order) design is provided, aiming at maximizing the total transmission rate under strict block error rate (BLER) constraints. In particular, a Bayesian optimization (BO) driven Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) method is proposed, which determines the device served order sequence and the corresponding modulation and coding scheme (MCS) adaptively based on the imperfect CSI. Note that the imperfection of CSI, error sample imbalance in URLLC networks, as well as the parameter sensitivity nature of the TD3 algorithm likely diminish the algorithm's convergence speed and reliability. To address such an issue, we proposed a BO based training mechanism for the convergence speed improvement, which provides a more reliable learning direction and sample selection method to track the imbalance sample problem. Via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence and higher sum-rate performance compared to existing solutions.

*Yankang Li,Changsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SE-MLP, a multi-layer perceptron with channel attention and residual connections, to rapidly predict acceleration feature values for penetration processes, achieving high accuracy, generalization, and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for obtaining prior feature values of penetration acceleration involve long simulation cycles and expensive computations, creating a need for a faster and more efficient approach.

Method: A squeeze and excitation multi-layer perceptron (SE-MLP) is developed, integrating a channel attention mechanism and residual connections, which takes physical parameters as input to output acceleration features, establishing a nonlinear mapping.

Result: SE-MLP outperforms conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models in prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability, with ablation studies confirming the contributions of the channel attention module and residual structure; numerical simulations and range recovery tests show acceptable discrepancies between predicted and measured values.

Conclusion: The method is validated as feasible and engineering-applicable, offering a practical basis for rapidly generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes.

Abstract: Accurate identification of the penetration process relies heavily on prior feature values of penetration acceleration. However, these feature values are typically obtained through long simulation cycles and expensive computations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a multi-layer Perceptron architecture, termed squeeze and excitation multi-layer perceptron (SE-MLP), which integrates a channel attention mechanism with residual connections to enable rapid prediction of acceleration feature values. Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics. Comparative experiments against conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models demonstrate that SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains. Numerical simulations and range recovery tests show that the discrepancies between predicted and measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths remain within acceptable engineering tolerances. These results validate the feasibility and engineering applicability of the proposed method and provide a practical basis for rapidly generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes.

TL;DR: A benchmark called VL-RouterBench is introduced to systematically evaluate VLM routing systems, covering multiple datasets and models, with methods to measure accuracy, cost, and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work lacks a systematic and reproducible benchmark for evaluating vision-language model (VLM) routing systems, hindering progress in this area.

Method: VL-RouterBench is developed by using raw inference and scoring logs from VLMs to build quality and cost matrices. It includes 30,540 samples across 14 datasets, 17 models, and implements an evaluation protocol measuring accuracy, cost, and throughput with a ranking score.

Result: Evaluation of 10 routing methods shows significant routability gain, but there remains a gap to the ideal Oracle, indicating room for improvement in router design.

Conclusion: VL-RouterBench provides a comprehensive benchmark for VLM routing, with plans to open-source the toolchain to enhance comparability, reproducibility, and deployment in multimodal routing research.

Abstract: Multi-model routing has evolved from an engineering technique into essential infrastructure, yet existing work lacks a systematic, reproducible benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). We present VL-RouterBench to assess the overall capability of VLM routing systems systematically. The benchmark is grounded in raw inference and scoring logs from VLMs and constructs quality and cost matrices over sample-model pairs. In scale, VL-RouterBench covers 14 datasets across 3 task groups, totaling 30,540 samples, and includes 15 open-source models and 2 API models, yielding 519,180 sample-model pairs and a total input-output token volume of 34,494,977. The evaluation protocol jointly measures average accuracy, average cost, and throughput, and builds a ranking score from the harmonic mean of normalized cost and accuracy to enable comparison across router configurations and cost budgets. On this benchmark, we evaluate 10 routing methods and baselines and observe a significant routability gain, while the best current routers still show a clear gap to the ideal Oracle, indicating considerable room for improvement in router architecture through finer visual cues and modeling of textual structure. We will open-source the complete data construction and evaluation toolchain to promote comparability, reproducibility, and practical deployment in multimodal routing research.

*Anqi Mao,Mehryar Mohri,Yutao Zhong*

TL;DR: The paper introduces principled algorithms for optimizing generalized metrics like the Fβ-measure and Jaccard coefficient in imbalanced classification, with H-consistency and finite-sample guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current threshold-based methods for optimizing metrics in class-imbalanced scenarios are computationally and statistically challenging, lack customization for restricted hypothesis sets, and have no finite-sample guarantees.

Method: Reformulates metric optimization as a generalized cost-sensitive learning problem, designs novel surrogate loss functions with H-consistency guarantees, and develops the METRO algorithm.

Result: Experiments show the proposed methods outperform prior baselines, with algorithms supporting theoretical performance guarantees.

Conclusion: The approach provides effective and theoretically-backed algorithms for optimizing generalized metrics in imbalanced learning, addressing weaknesses in existing methods.

Abstract: In applications with significant class imbalance or asymmetric costs, metrics such as the $F_β$-measure, AM measure, Jaccard similarity coefficient, and weighted accuracy offer more suitable evaluation criteria than standard binary classification loss. However, optimizing these metrics present significant computational and statistical challenges. Existing approaches often rely on the characterization of the Bayes-optimal classifier, and use threshold-based methods that first estimate class probabilities and then seek an optimal threshold. This leads to algorithms that are not tailored to restricted hypothesis sets and lack finite-sample performance guarantees. In this work, we introduce principled algorithms for optimizing generalized metrics, supported by $H$-consistency and finite-sample generalization bounds. Our approach reformulates metric optimization as a generalized cost-sensitive learning problem, enabling the design of novel surrogate loss functions with provable $H$-consistency guarantees. Leveraging this framework, we develop new algorithms, METRO (Metric Optimization), with strong theoretical performance guarantees. We report the results of experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods compared to prior baselines.

### [178] [Le Cam Distortion: A Decision-Theoretic Framework for Robust Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23617)
*Deniz Akdemir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper critiques Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for causing information loss and negative transfer when domains are unequally informative, and proposes Le Cam Distortion as a decision-theoretic framework with directional simulability for safe, risk-controlled transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current UDA approach enforces feature invariance, which is flawed when domains have unequal informativeness, leading to negative transfer and catastrophic failures in safety-critical applications like medical imaging and autonomous systems.

Method: The authors propose a decision-theoretic framework based on Le Cam's theory, using constructive approximations and directional simulability, quantified by Deficiency Distance, and learning a kernel to simulate the target from the source without degrading the source.

Result: Experiments across genomics, vision, and RL show Le Cam Distortion achieves near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics, zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 classification, and safe policy transfer in RL, outperforming invariance-based methods like CycleGAN.

Conclusion: Le Cam Distortion provides a principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning, enabling safe and effective transfer without negative transfer, particularly crucial in domains like medicine and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Distribution shift is the defining challenge of real-world machine learning. The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing "negative transfer" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].
  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $δ(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GNN-TF, a model integrating brain data and tabular data with time-awareness to predict tobacco use in adolescents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combining non-Euclidean brain imaging and Euclidean tabular data for outcome forecasting is challenging in medical imaging, especially in longitudinal studies.

Method: Propose a time-aware graph neural network with transformer fusion (GNN-TF) to integrate dynamic brain connectivity and tabular data using temporal order.

Result: GNN-TF outperformed established ML/DL models in predictive accuracy for future tobacco usage in a longitudinal fMRI dataset.

Conclusion: GNN-TF effectively integrates multiple data modalities and temporal dynamics, serving as a valuable tool for clinical outcome prediction in brain imaging.

Abstract: Integrating non-Euclidean brain imaging data with Euclidean tabular data, such as clinical and demographic information, poses a substantial challenge for medical imaging analysis, particularly in forecasting future outcomes. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BOAD automates hierarchy discovery for multi-agent systems in software engineering using bandit optimization, improving generalization on long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with real-world SWE problems due to monolithic designs that cause irrelevant context retention and poor generalization; human-like decomposition is needed.

Method: Formulates hierarchy discovery as a multi-armed bandit problem, where sub-agents for tasks like localization are evaluated collaboratively to optimize design efficiently.

Result: Outperforms single-agent and manual multi-agent systems on SWE-bench-Verified; ranks second on SWE-bench-Live with a 36B system, surpassing larger models like GPT-4.

Conclusion: Automatically discovered hierarchical multi-agent systems significantly enhance generalization for challenging SWE tasks, with code provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning and coding capabilities, yet they struggle to generalize to real-world software engineering (SWE) problems that are long-horizon and out of distribution. Existing systems often rely on a single agent to handle the entire workflow-interpreting issues, navigating large codebases, and implementing fixes-within one reasoning chain. Such monolithic designs force the model to retain irrelevant context, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization. Motivated by how human engineers decompose complex problems, we propose structuring SWE agents as orchestrators coordinating specialized sub-agents for sub-tasks such as localization, editing, and validation. The challenge lies in discovering effective hierarchies automatically: as the number of sub-agents grows, the search space becomes combinatorial, and it is difficult to attribute credit to individual sub-agents within a team. We address these challenges by formulating hierarchy discovery as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where each arm represents a candidate sub-agent and the reward measures its helpfulness when collaborating with others. This framework, termed Bandit Optimization for Agent Design (BOAD), enables efficient exploration of sub-agent designs under limited evaluation budgets. On SWE-bench-Verified, BOAD outperforms single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems. On SWE-bench-Live, featuring more recent and out-of-distribution issues, our 36B system ranks second on the leaderboard at the time of evaluation, surpassing larger models such as GPT-4 and Claude. These results demonstrate that automatically discovered hierarchical multi-agent systems significantly improve generalization on challenging long-horizon SWE tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weak signal learning is challenging due to noise and lack of specialized datasets, hindering feature identification in areas like fault diagnosis and medical imaging.

Method: The paper constructs a dataset with 13,158 spectral samples (low SNR, class imbalance) and proposes PDVFN, a model using dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency maps) with principles like local enhancement and noise suppression.

Result: Experiments show the method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, particularly in low SNR scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides a dataset, baseline model, and foundation for future weak signal learning research, offering a novel solution for tasks like astronomical spectroscopy.

Abstract: Weak signal learning (WSL) is a common challenge in many fields like fault diagnosis, medical imaging, and autonomous driving, where critical information is often masked by noise and interference, making feature identification difficult. Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios. This study provides a dedicated dataset, a baseline model, and establishes a foundation for future WSL research.

Conclusion: The algorithm is effective for decentralized multi-task representation learning, demonstrating theoretical and practical benefits in sample complexity, iteration efficiency, and communication.

Abstract: Representation learning is a widely adopted framework for learning in data-scarce environments to obtain a feature extractor or representation from various different yet related tasks. Despite extensive research on representation learning, decentralized approaches remain relatively underexplored. This work develops a decentralized projected gradient descent-based algorithm for multi-task representation learning. We focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. We present an alternating projected gradient descent and minimization algorithm for recovering a low-rank feature matrix in a diffusion-based decentralized and federated fashion. We obtain constructive, provable guarantees that provide a lower bound on the required sample complexity and an upper bound on the iteration complexity of our proposed algorithm. We analyze the time and communication complexity of our algorithm and show that it is fast and communication-efficient. We performed numerical simulations to validate the performance of our algorithm and compared it with benchmark algorithms.

### [183] [Evaluating Parameter Efficient Methods for RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23165)
*Qingyu Yin,Yulun Wu,Zhennan Shen,Sunbowen Li,Zhilin Wang,Yanshu Li,Chak Tou Leong,Jiale Kang,Jinjin Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A systematic evaluation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, like LoRA and its variants, in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) was conducted. The study found that structural variants (DoRA, AdaLoRA, MiSS) outperform standard LoRA, identified issues with SVD-based initialization methods, and highlighted the limitations of extreme parameter reduction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to identify the optimal PEFT architecture for RLVR, since while default methods like LoRA are used, no comprehensive evaluation exists to determine the best PEFT method for this specific paradigm that uses verifiable rewards to enhance language models' reasoning capabilities.

Method: The method involves a comprehensive evaluation of over 12 PEFT methodologies on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill families across mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using empirical experiments, ablations, and scaling studies to analyze performance and identify underlying issues like spectral collapse.

Result: Results show that structural variants (DoRA, AdaLoRA, MiSS) consistently outperform standard LoRA, SVD-informed initialization methods (PiSSA, MiLoRA) fail due to spectral collapse and misalignment with RL optimization, and extreme parameter reduction methods (VeRA, Rank-1) severely limit reasoning capacity.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the default adoption of standard LoRA is challenged, advocating for more exploration and optimization of PEFT methods in RLVR, as existing methods have specific drawbacks (spectral collapse, parameter bottlenecks) and alternatives (DoRA, AdaLoRA, MiSS) perform better, providing a definitive guide for future research.

Abstract: We systematically evaluate Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods under the paradigm of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). RLVR incentivizes language models to enhance their reasoning capabilities through verifiable feedback; however, while methods like LoRA are commonly used, the optimal PEFT architecture for RLVR remains unidentified. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of over 12 PEFT methodologies across the DeepSeek-R1-Distill families on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results challenge the default adoption of standard LoRA with three main findings. First, we demonstrate that structural variants, such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS, consistently outperform LoRA. Second, we uncover a spectral collapse phenomenon in SVD-informed initialization strategies (\textit{e.g.,} PiSSA, MiLoRA), attributing their failure to a fundamental misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization. Furthermore, our ablations reveal that extreme parameter reduction (\textit{e.g.,} VeRA, Rank-1) severely bottlenecks reasoning capacity. We further conduct ablation studies and scaling experiments to validate our findings. This work provides a definitive guide for advocating for more exploration for parameter-efficient RL methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Therapeutic peptides require accurate property prediction, but current molecular language models like SMILES or amino-acid representations fail to capture their chemical and topological complexity, such as cyclic structures and modifications.

Method: The authors propose HELM-BERT, an encoder-based peptide language model based on DeBERTa, trained on HELM notation to capture hierarchical dependencies. It is pre-trained on a curated dataset of 39,079 chemically diverse peptides with linear and cyclic structures.

Result: HELM-BERT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SMILES-based models in downstream tasks, including cyclic peptide membrane permeability prediction and peptide-protein interaction prediction.

Conclusion: HELM's explicit monomer- and topology-aware representations provide substantial data-efficiency advantages for therapeutic peptide modeling, bridging the gap between small-molecule and protein language models.

Abstract: Therapeutic peptides have emerged as a pivotal modality in modern drug discovery, occupying a chemically and topologically rich space. While accurate prediction of their physicochemical properties is essential for accelerating peptide development, existing molecular language models rely on representations that fail to capture this complexity. Atom-level SMILES notation generates long token sequences and obscures cyclic topology, whereas amino-acid-level representations cannot encode the diverse chemical modifications central to modern peptide design. To bridge this representational gap, the Hierarchical Editing Language for Macromolecules (HELM) offers a unified framework enabling precise description of both monomer composition and connectivity, making it a promising foundation for peptide language modeling. Here, we propose HELM-BERT, the first encoder-based peptide language model trained on HELM notation. Based on DeBERTa, HELM-BERT is specifically designed to capture hierarchical dependencies within HELM sequences. The model is pre-trained on a curated corpus of 39,079 chemically diverse peptides spanning linear and cyclic structures. HELM-BERT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SMILES-based language models in downstream tasks, including cyclic peptide membrane permeability prediction and peptide-protein interaction prediction. These results demonstrate that HELM's explicit monomer- and topology-aware representations offer substantial data-efficiency advantages for modeling therapeutic peptides, bridging a long-standing gap between small-molecule and protein language models.

### [186] [A Simple, Optimal and Efficient Algorithm for Online Exp-Concave Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23190)
*Yi-Han Wang,Peng Zhao,Zhi-Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LightONS is a computationally efficient variant of Online Newton Step (ONS) for online exp-concave optimization, reducing runtime from previously high costs while maintaining optimal regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard ONS algorithm suffers from expensive Mahalanobis projections, costing Ω(d^ω) operations per round, leading to total runtime of O(d^ω T), and a COLT'13 open problem asks for a more efficient SXO algorithm.

Method: LightONS modifies ONS by using domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism, delaying costly projections until necessary.

Result: LightONS achieves O(d^2 T + d^ω √(T log T)) total runtime while preserving optimal O(d log T) regret, and enables an SXO method with runtime Θ(d^3/ε), solving the open problem.

Conclusion: LightONS serves as an efficient plug-in replacement for ONS, applicable beyond regret minimization to scenarios like gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.

Abstract: Online eXp-concave Optimization (OXO) is a fundamental problem in online learning. The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $Ω(d^ω)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $ω\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\tilde{O}(d^ωT)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \tilde{O}(d/ε)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $ε$, and thereby necessitates an $\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$.
  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^ω\sqrt{T \log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\tilde{O}(d^3/ε)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PGOT uses geometric attention and adaptive routing to model PDEs on unstructured meshes without losing boundary information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with large-scale unstructured meshes in PDE modeling, causing geometric aliasing and loss of physical boundary details.

Method: Introduces PGOT with Spectrum-Preserving Geometric Attention for multi-scale geometry encoding and dynamic routing based on spatial features.

Result: Achieves SOTA on four benchmarks and excels in industrial tasks like airfoil and car design.

Conclusion: PGOT effectively mitigates geometric aliasing, enabling accurate and efficient PDE modeling on complex geometries.

Abstract: While Transformers have demonstrated remarkable potential in modeling Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), modeling large-scale unstructured meshes with complex geometries remains a significant challenge. Existing efficient architectures often employ feature dimensionality reduction strategies, which inadvertently induces Geometric Aliasing, resulting in the loss of critical physical boundary information. To address this, we propose the Physics-Geometry Operator Transformer (PGOT), designed to reconstruct physical feature learning through explicit geometry awareness. Specifically, we propose Spectrum-Preserving Geometric Attention (SpecGeo-Attention). Utilizing a ``physics slicing-geometry injection" mechanism, this module incorporates multi-scale geometric encodings to explicitly preserve multi-scale geometric features while maintaining linear computational complexity $O(N)$. Furthermore, PGOT dynamically routes computations to low-order linear paths for smooth regions and high-order non-linear paths for shock waves and discontinuities based on spatial coordinates, enabling spatially adaptive and high-precision physical field modeling. PGOT achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across four standard benchmarks and excels in large-scale industrial tasks including airfoil and car designs.

*Ziru Niu,Hai Dong,A. K. Qin,Tao Gu,Pengcheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOLF is a federated learning method for IoT devices that freezes layers in order to reduce computation and memory, uses tensor operation approximation for efficiency, and achieves higher accuracy and lower resource use than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning in IoT faces challenges due to limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of edge devices, with existing approaches sacrificing accuracy or ignoring memory constraints.

Method: Introduces FedOLF with ordered layer freezing before training and Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA) instead of quantization to reduce computation, memory, communication, and energy costs.

Result: FedOLF outperforms existing works in accuracy on multiple datasets and models (e.g., CNN on EMNIST, AlexNet on CIFAR-10, ResNet on CIFAR-100 and CINIC-10), with at least 0.3% to 6.4% higher accuracy, along with improved energy efficiency and lower memory usage.

Conclusion: FedOLF effectively addresses efficiency and scalability issues in FL for IoT by combining ordered layer freezing and TOA, offering a practical solution that balances accuracy and resource constraints.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). By keeping data local and coordinating model training through a central server, FL effectively addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead. However, the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices pose significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of FL, especially when training deep neural networks. Various FL frameworks have been proposed to reduce computation and communication overheads through dropout or layer freezing. However, these approaches often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints. To this end, in this work, we introduce Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF). FedOLF consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training, significantly mitigating computation and memory requirements. To further reduce communication and energy costs, we incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization that better preserves model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that over non-iid data, FedOLF achieves at least 0.3%, 6.4%, 5.81%, 4.4%, 6.27% and 1.29% higher accuracy than existing works respectively on EMNIST (with CNN), CIFAR-10 (with AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), and CINIC-10 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph federated learning faces unfairness from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs; FairGFL proposed to enhance fairness while preserving privacy and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research shows overlapping data helps with data heterogeneity, but negative effects, especially from imbalanced overlaps, are unexplored, leading to unfairness in collaborative learning.

Method: Propose FairGFL with an interpretable weighted aggregation based on privacy-preserving overlap ratio estimation and a regularizer in the federated loss for utility-fairness tradeoff.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets show FairGFL outperforms four baselines in both model utility and fairness.

Conclusion: FairGFL effectively addresses unfairness from imbalanced overlaps in graph federated learning, improving fairness and utility in a privacy-preserving way.

Abstract: Graph federated learning enables the collaborative extraction of high-order information from distributed subgraphs while preserving the privacy of raw data. However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PFed-signal uses federated learning and Euclidean distance to remove biased data from FAERS, improving ADR prediction accuracy with Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biased data in FAERS leads to misleading ADR predictions, and traditional methods like ROR/PRR can't eliminate bias effectively.

Method: Proposes PFed-Signal: splits data with Pfed-Split, identifies biased data via Euclidean distance in federated learning, then trains Transformer model on cleaned data.

Result: Clean dataset shows improved ROR/PRR over traditional methods; PFed-Signal achieves accuracy 0.887, F1 0.890, recall 0.913, AUC 0.957, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: PFed-signal effectively reduces bias in ADR data and enhances prediction performance, offering a robust approach for accurate signal detection.

Abstract: The adverse drug reactions (ADRs) predicted based on the biased records in FAERS (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System) may mislead diagnosis online. Generally, such problems are solved by optimizing reporting odds ratio (ROR) or proportional reporting ratio (PRR). However, these methods that rely on statistical methods cannot eliminate the biased data, leading to inaccurate signal prediction. In this paper, we propose PFed-signal, a federated learning-based signal prediction model of ADR, which utilizes the Euclidean distance to eliminate the biased data from FAERS, thereby improving the accuracy of ADR prediction. Specifically, we first propose Pfed-Split, a method to split the original dataset into a split dataset based on ADR. Then we propose ADR-signal, an ADR prediction model, including a biased data identification method based on federated learning and an ADR prediction model based on Transformer. The former identifies the biased data according to the Euclidean distance and generates a clean dataset by deleting the biased data. The latter is an ADR prediction model based on Transformer trained on the clean data set. The results show that the ROR and PRR on the clean dataset are better than those of the traditional methods. Furthermore, the accuracy rate, F1 score, recall rate and AUC of PFed-Signal are 0.887, 0.890, 0.913 and 0.957 respectively, which are higher than the baselines.

*Yuchen Xie,Honghang Chi,Haopeng Quan,Yahui Wang,Wei Wang,Yu Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HC-PINNs use hard constraints for boundary conditions, but their training dynamics were unexplored. This work shows boundary functions act as spectral filters, causing spectral collapse, and establishes an NTK framework to predict convergence via effective rank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard-constrained PINNs (HC-PINNs) enforce boundary conditions strictly, yet the theoretical understanding of their training mechanisms was missing, unlike soft-constrained versions with additive penalties.

Method: A rigorous Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework is developed for HC-PINNs to derive an explicit kernel composition law, analyzing the boundary function's role as a multiplicative spatial modulation and conducting spectral analysis.

Result: The boundary function reshapes the eigenspectrum of the neural network's kernel, with effective rank of the residual kernel identified as a key predictor of training convergence, revealing that common boundary functions can induce spectral collapse and stagnation.

Conclusion: This framework turns boundary function design from heuristic to a principled spectral optimization problem, providing a theoretical foundation for geometric hard constraints in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks with hard constraints (HC-PINNs) are increasingly favored for their ability to strictly enforce boundary conditions via a trial function ansatz $\tilde{u} = A + B \cdot N$, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing their training dynamics have remained unexplored.
  Unlike soft-constrained formulations where boundary terms act as additive penalties, this work reveals that the boundary function $B$ introduces a multiplicative spatial modulation that fundamentally alters the learning landscape.
  A rigorous Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework for HC-PINNs is established, deriving the explicit kernel composition law.
  This relationship demonstrates that the boundary function $B(\vec{x})$ functions as a spectral filter, reshaping the eigenspectrum of the neural network's native kernel.
  Through spectral analysis, the effective rank of the residual kernel is identified as a deterministic predictor of training convergence, superior to classical condition numbers.
  It is shown that widely used boundary functions can inadvertently induce spectral collapse, leading to optimization stagnation despite exact boundary satisfaction.
  Validated across multi-dimensional benchmarks, this framework transforms the design of boundary functions from a heuristic choice into a principled spectral optimization problem, providing a solid theoretical foundation for geometric hard constraints in scientific machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen understanding of forward value propagation and gradient flow in transformer architectures by manually deriving backpropagation, highlighting the educational benefit over automated tools.

Method: Apply an index-free, lightweight methodology to derive gradients for embedding layers, multi-headed self-attention, layer normalization, and LoRA layers in transformer-based next-token-prediction models.

Result: Complete analytic expressions for all gradient updates in a minimal GPT-like network, accompanied by a full PyTorch implementation for practical validation.

Conclusion: Manual backpropagation in transformers enhances intuition for how operations influence outputs, despite the availability of automatic tools, and provides a rigorous foundation for understanding gradient dynamics.

Abstract: This document is a follow-up to our previous paper dedicated to a vectorized derivation of backpropagation in CNNs. Following the same principles and notations already put in place there, we now focus on transformer-based next-token-prediction architectures. To this end, we apply our lightweight index-free methodology to new types of layers such as embedding, multi-headed self-attention and layer normalization. In addition, we also provide gradient expressions for LoRA layers to illustrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Why bother doing manual backpropagation when there are so many tools that do this automatically? Any gap in understanding of how values propagate forward will become evident when attempting to differentiate the loss function. By working through the backward pass manually, we gain a deeper intuition for how each operation influences the final output. A complete PyTorch implementation of a minimalistic GPT-like network is also provided along with analytical expressions for of all of its gradient updates.

TL;DR: ISOPO is a single-step natural policy gradient method using Fisher normalization or neural tangent kernel transformations, more efficient than multi-step proximal methods like GRPO or CISPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proximal policy optimization methods (e.g., GRPO, CISPO) are inefficient as they require multiple gradient steps with importance ratio clipping to approximate natural policy gradients.

Method: ISOPO normalizes log-probability gradients in the Fisher metric and contracts with advantages in a single step; a variant uses neural tangent kernel transformations of microbatch advantages layer-wise in one backward pass.

Result: ISOPO approximates natural policy gradients efficiently with negligible computational overhead compared to vanilla REINFORCE, outperforming multi-step methods.

Conclusion: ISOPO provides a novel, computationally efficient approach to natural policy gradient approximation in reinforcement learning, enabling faster training with single-step optimizations.

Abstract: This note introduces Isometric Policy Optimization (ISOPO), an efficient method to approximate the natural policy gradient in a single gradient step. In comparison, existing proximal policy methods such as GRPO or CISPO use multiple gradient steps with variants of importance ratio clipping to approximate a natural gradient step relative to a reference policy. In its simplest form, ISOPO normalizes the log-probability gradient of each sequence in the Fisher metric before contracting with the advantages. Another variant of ISOPO transforms the microbatch advantages based on the neural tangent kernel in each layer. ISOPO applies this transformation layer-wise in a single backward pass and can be implemented with negligible computational overhead compared to vanilla REINFORCE.

TL;DR: A deep learning framework combining generative models and neural operators for efficient, high-resolution velocity model building in subsurface imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional velocity model building methods are computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting high-precision subsurface imaging; deep learning offers a data-driven alternative.

Method: Proposes a framework where a neural operator acts as a forward mapping to generate RTM extended images from velocity models, and a generative model serves as a regularizer to enhance resolution, using automatic differentiation for velocity updates.

Result: The approach produces cleaner, higher-resolution velocity models, validated through synthetic and field data experiments.

Conclusion: The generative neural operator framework effectively improves velocity model building efficiency and resolution, demonstrating potential to overcome limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Velocity model building serves as a crucial component for achieving high precision subsurface imaging. However, conventional velocity model building methods are often computationally expensive and time consuming. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly the success of generative models and neural operators, deep learning based approaches that integrate data and their statistics have attracted increasing attention in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines generative models with neural operators to obtain high resolution velocity models efficiently. Within this workflow, the neural operator functions as a forward mapping operator to rapidly generate time lag reverse time migration (RTM) extended images from the true and migration velocity models. In this framework, the neural operator is acting as a surrogate for modeling followed by migration, which uses the true and migration velocities, respectively. The trained neural operator is then employed, through automatic differentiation, to gradually update the migration velocity placed in the true velocity input channel with high resolution components so that the output of the network matches the time lag images of observed data obtained using the migration velocity. By embedding a generative model, trained on a high-resolution velocity model distribution, which corresponds to the true velocity model distribution used to train the neural operator, as a regularizer, the resulting predictions are cleaner with higher resolution information. Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator based velocity model building approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes blind inverse problems where the forward operator is unknown, focusing on learning within the Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSE) framework. It provides theoretical guarantees, derivations of optimal estimators, equivalences with Tikhonov regularization, convergence results, finite-sample error bounds, and numerical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind inverse problems are common in experiments with unknown forward operators, but existing data-driven methods lack interpretability and theoretical guarantees, limiting reliability in areas like imaging inverse problems.

Method: The work uses a simplified framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs) for in-depth theoretical analysis. Methods include deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators, extending classical results, establishing equivalences with Tikhonov-regularized formulations that depend on signal, noise, and operator distributions, proving convergence under source conditions, and deriving finite-sample error bounds.

Result: The paper establishes equivalences between optimal LMMSE estimators and Tikhonov regularization, proves convergence results, and derives rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize performance based on noise level, problem conditioning, and sample size, quantifying the impact of operator randomness and convergence rates.

Conclusion: The theoretical findings are validated through numerical experiments, confirming predicted convergence behavior and providing a rigorous, interpretable approach to learning in blind inverse problems with explicit theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Blind inverse problems arise in many experimental settings where the forward operator is partially or entirely unknown. In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs often fail with heterophilic graphs where connected nodes have dissimilar labels, as feature similarity is weak, requiring better structural learning.

Method: Uses a learnable masking function to infer homophilic and heterophilic graphs, processes them with low- and high-pass filter banks, and applies a label-based structural loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and graph rewiring methods on six heterophilic benchmarks, showing enhanced performance.

Conclusion: FgGSL effectively combines frequency information with supervised topology inference to learn discriminative node representations for heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to learn discriminative node representations for heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar labels and feature similarity provides weak structural cues. We propose frequency-guided graph structure learning (FgGSL), an end-to-end graph inference framework that jointly learns homophilic and heterophilic graph structures along with a spectral encoder. FgGSL employs a learnable, symmetric, feature-driven masking function to infer said complementary graphs, which are processed using pre-designed low- and high-pass graph filter banks. A label-based structural loss explicitly promotes the recovery of homophilic and heterophilic edges, enabling task-driven graph structure learning. We derive stability bounds for the structural loss and establish robustness guarantees for the filter banks under graph perturbations. Experiments on six heterophilic benchmarks demonstrate that FgGSL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and graph rewiring methods, highlighting the benefits of combining frequency information with supervised topology inference.

TL;DR: STAMP is a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information stochastically using time differences for disease progression prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised methods like MAE lack temporal awareness, which is critical for capturing disease evolution in longitudinal medical datasets.

Method: STAMP conditions on time differences between input volumes, reframing MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective to model stochastic temporal dynamics.

Result: STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on progression prediction for Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease.

Conclusion: STAMP's stochastic approach effectively learns non-deterministic disease progression, showing promise for longitudinal medical analysis.

Abstract: Temporally aware image representations are crucial for capturing disease progression in 3D volumes of longitudinal medical datasets. However, recent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches like Masked Autoencoding (MAE), despite their strong representation learning capabilities, lack temporal awareness. In this paper, we propose STAMP (Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining), a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on the time difference between the 2 input volumes. Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient. STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed both existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on different late stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction which require models to learn the underlying non-deterministic temporal dynamics of the diseases.

Result: DSC reduces parameter complexity to O(M d) and memory traffic to O(Kd), compared to O(M rd) in standard Mixture-of-LoRAs, with rigorous worst-case bounds from Frame-Theoretic regularization and spectral constraints.

Conclusion: DSC provides an efficient and stable alternative to traditional MoE methods, effectively mitigating issues like representation collapse while offering theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models scale capacity but often suffer from representation collapse and gradient instability. We propose Dynamic Subspace Composition (DSC), a framework that approximates context-dependent weights via a state-dependent, sparse expansion of a shared basis bank. Formally, DSC models the weight update as a residual trajectory within a Star- Shaped Domain, employing a Magnitude-Gated Simplex Interpolation to ensure continuity at the identity. Unlike standard Mixture-of-LoRAs, which incurs O(M rd) parameter complexity by retrieving independent rank-r matrices, DSC constructs a compositional rank-K approximation from decoupled unit-norm basis vectors. This reduces parameter complexity to O(M d) and memory traffic to O(Kd), while Frame-Theoretic regularization and spectral constraints provide rigorous worst-case bounds on the dynamic update.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of distribution shifts in machine learning to improve AI trustworthiness, focusing on robustness, explainability, and adaptability across perturbation, domain, and modality shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shifts are a major weakness in ML systems, limiting reliability and causing trust issues in AI, despite its advancements like ResNet, Transformer, and scaling laws enabling general intelligence.

Method: The research analyzes three types of distribution shifts (perturbation, domain, and modality shifts) and evaluates trustworthiness through robustness, explainability, and adaptability, proposing solutions to enhance ML problems like efficiency and safety.

Result: The study provides effective solutions and fundamental insights into handling distribution shifts to bolster AI's trustworthiness, though specific experimental results or metrics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the critical need for trustworthy machine learning under distribution shifts to ensure AI's reliability and societal impact, aiming to advance robustness, versatility, and responsibility in ML systems.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has been a foundational topic in artificial intelligence (AI), providing both theoretical groundwork and practical tools for its exciting advancements. From ResNet for visual recognition to Transformer for vision-language alignment, the AI models have achieved superior capability to humans. Furthermore, the scaling law has enabled AI to initially develop general intelligence, as demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs). To this stage, AI has had an enormous influence on society and yet still keeps shaping the future for humanity. However, distribution shift remains a persistent ``Achilles' heel'', fundamentally limiting the reliability and general usefulness of ML systems. Moreover, generalization under distribution shift would also cause trust issues for AIs. Motivated by these challenges, my research focuses on \textit{Trustworthy Machine Learning under Distribution Shifts}, with the goal of expanding AI's robustness, versatility, as well as its responsibility and reliability. We carefully study the three common distribution shifts into: (1) Perturbation Shift, (2) Domain Shift, and (3) Modality Shift. For all scenarios, we also rigorously investigate trustworthiness via three aspects: (1) Robustness, (2) Explainability, and (3) Adaptability. Based on these dimensions, we propose effective solutions and fundamental insights, meanwhile aiming to enhance the critical ML problems, such as efficiency, adaptability, and safety.

*Maryam Mirzaei,Farzaneh Shayegh,Hamed Narimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EGDA is a framework that improves EEG-based emotion recognition by aligning global and class-specific distributions across sessions and using graph regularization to preserve data structure, achieving high cross-session accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate emotion recognition is crucial for human-machine interaction, and EEG is a reliable source, but model generalization is challenged by variations across recording sessions.

Method: Propose EGDA to reduce cross-session discrepancies by jointly aligning global (marginal) and class-specific (conditional) distributions and preserving the intrinsic structure of EEG data through graph regularization.

Result: On the SEED-IV dataset, EGDA achieves robust cross-session performance with accuracies of 81.22%, 80.15%, and 83.27% across three transfer tasks, surpassing baseline methods.

Conclusion: EGDA effectively addresses cross-session variation in EEG-based emotion recognition, identifies the Gamma band as most discriminative, and highlights central-parietal and prefrontal brain regions as critical for reliable recognition.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of human emotional states is critical for effective human-machine interaction. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a reliable source for emotion recognition due to its high temporal resolution and its direct reflection of neural activity. Nevertheless, variations across recording sessions present a major challenge for model generalization. To address this issue, we propose EGDA, a framework that reduces cross-session discrepancies by jointly aligning the global (marginal) and class-specific (conditional) distributions, while preserving the intrinsic structure of EEG data through graph regularization. Experimental results on the SEED-IV dataset demonstrate that EGDA achieves robust cross-session performance, obtaining accuracies of 81.22%, 80.15%, and 83.27% across three transfer tasks, and surpassing several baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the Gamma frequency band as the most discriminative and identifies the central-parietal and prefrontal brain regions as critical for reliable emotion recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Statistical Process Control (SPC) is limited by often violated statistical assumptions, leading to unreliable monitoring in modern, complex manufacturing environments, motivating the enhancement of SPC with more robust methods.

Method: Integrate Conformal Prediction's distribution-free, model-agnostic guarantees into SPC via two novel applications: Conformal-Enhanced Control Charts for visualizing process uncertainty and proactive signals like 'uncertainty spikes', and Conformal-Enhanced Process Monitoring for reframing multivariate control as an anomaly detection problem using p-value charts.

Result: The framework provides a more robust and statistically rigorous approach to quality control compared to traditional SPC.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework maintains the interpretability and ease of use of classic SPC methods while significantly enhancing reliability in complex settings.

Abstract: Traditional Statistical Process Control (SPC) is essential for quality management but is limited by its reliance on often violated statistical assumptions, leading to unreliable monitoring in modern, complex manufacturing environments. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that enhances SPC by integrating the distribution free, model agnostic guarantees of Conformal Prediction. We propose two novel applications: Conformal-Enhanced Control Charts, which visualize process uncertainty and enable proactive signals like 'uncertainty spikes', and Conformal-Enhanced Process Monitoring, which reframes multivariate control as a formal anomaly detection problem using an intuitive p-value chart. Our framework provides a more robust and statistically rigorous approach to quality control while maintaining the interpretability and ease of use of classic methods.

### [203] [Random Controlled Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23670)
*Francesco Piatti,Thomas Cass,William F. Turner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-efficient framework for time-series learning that uses random features with controlled differential equations as continuous-time reservoirs, with two variants proposed and evaluated on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop fast, scalable models for time-series learning with strong inductive bias, avoiding explicit signature computations by leveraging random features and CDEs.

Method: Large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs to map input paths to representations, with only a linear readout layer trained. Two variants: Random Fourier CDEs (RF-CDEs) use random Fourier features for kernel-free RBF approximation, and Random Rough DEs (R-RDEs) operate on rough-path inputs via log-ODE discretization with log-signatures.

Result: Proves equivalence to RBF-lifted signature kernel and rough signature kernels in infinite-width limit; models achieve competitive or state-of-the-art performance on time-series benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical alternative to explicit signature computations, retaining inductive bias while benefiting from random feature efficiency, with unified connections to path-signature theory.

Abstract: We introduce a training-efficient framework for time-series learning that combines random features with controlled differential equations (CDEs). In this approach, large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs, mapping input paths to rich representations. Only a linear readout layer is trained, resulting in fast, scalable models with strong inductive bias. Building on this foundation, we propose two variants: (i) Random Fourier CDEs (RF-CDEs): these lift the input signal using random Fourier features prior to the dynamics, providing a kernel-free approximation of RBF-enhanced sequence models; (ii) Random Rough DEs (R-RDEs): these operate directly on rough-path inputs via a log-ODE discretization, using log-signatures to capture higher-order temporal interactions while remaining stable and efficient. We prove that in the infinite-width limit, these model induces the RBF-lifted signature kernel and the rough signature kernel, respectively, offering a unified perspective on random-feature reservoirs, continuous-time deep architectures, and path-signature theory.
  We evaluate both models across a range of time-series benchmarks, demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These methods provide a practical alternative to explicit signature computations, retaining their inductive bias while benefiting from the efficiency of random features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A test-time training method called TTT-E2E uses a Transformer with sliding-window attention, meta-learning initialization, and continual learning via next-token prediction at test time to achieve efficient long-context language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context language modeling is challenging; previous approaches focus on architecture design, but this paper frames it as a continual learning problem, aiming for a solution that scales effectively while maintaining constant inference latency.

Method: The method uses a standard Transformer with sliding-window attention. It applies meta-learning at training time to improve initialization for test-time learning. At test time, the model continually learns via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing information into its weights.

Result: TTT-E2E scales with context length similarly to Transformers with full attention (e.g., for 3B models trained with 164B tokens) but has constant inference latency like RNNs, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for a 128K context. It outperforms models like Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet in scaling properties.

Conclusion: Test-time training applied end-to-end offers an effective approach for long-context modeling, combining the scalability of full attention with the efficiency benefits of constant inference latency, providing a practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: We formulate long-context language modeling as a problem in continual learning rather than architecture design. Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available.

*Shashwat Goel,Rishi Hazra,Dulhan Jayalath,Timon Willi,Parag Jain,William F. Shen,Ilias Leontiadis,Francesco Barbieri,Yoram Bachrach,Jonas Geiping,Chenxi Whitehouse*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI co-scientists aid researchers by generating constrained research plans, improved via corpus-based training with reinforcement learning and self-grading, validated by human experts showing preference and efficacy across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models currently struggle to generate research plans that adhere to all constraints and implicit requirements, limiting their effectiveness as AI co-scientists in assisting human researchers.

Method: Build a scalable, diverse training corpus by extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across domains, then train models via reinforcement learning with self-grading using a frozen copy as grader.

Result: Human experts prefer plans from the finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, approve 84% of extracted rubrics, and finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements with cross-domain generalization, validated in machine learning and medical research.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a scalable, automated training recipe that improves AI co-scientists' ability to generate effective research plans, proving generalizable across domains without external supervision.

Abstract: AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.

### [206] [ReCollab: Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Cooperative Ad-hoc Teammate Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22129)
*Conor Wallace,Umer Siddique,Yongcan Cao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: LLMs enable ad-hoc teamwork via behavior classification (Collab) and retrieval-augmented refinement (ReCollab), improving adaptation in cooperative environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ad-hoc teamwork requires agents to adapt to unseen teammates, but conventional probabilistic models/classifiers are brittle under partial observability and limited interaction. LLMs offer flexible reasoning for inferring teammate behavior.

Method: Collab uses LLMs to classify teammate types based on behavioral rubrics from trajectory features. ReCollab extends this with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to stabilize inference using exemplar trajectories.

Result: In cooperative Overcooked, Collab effectively distinguishes teammate types, while ReCollab improves adaptation across layouts, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs between classification accuracy and episodic return.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as behavioral world models for ad-hoc teamwork, and retrieval grounding via RAG enhances performance in challenging coordination settings.

Abstract: Ad-hoc teamwork (AHT) requires agents to infer the behavior of previously unseen teammates and adapt their policy accordingly. Conventional approaches often rely on fixed probabilistic models or classifiers, which can be brittle under partial observability and limited interaction. Large language models (LLMs) offer a flexible alternative: by mapping short behavioral traces into high-level hypotheses, they can serve as world models over teammate behavior. We introduce \Collab, a language-based framework that classifies partner types using a behavior rubric derived from trajectory features, and extend it to \ReCollab, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to stabilize inference with exemplar trajectories. In the cooperative Overcooked environment, \Collab effectively distinguishes teammate types, while \ReCollab consistently improves adaptation across layouts, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs between classification accuracy and episodic return. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs as behavioral world models for AHT and highlight the importance of retrieval grounding in challenging coordination settings.

### [207] [Solving Multi-Agent Multi-Goal Path Finding Problems in Polynomial Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22171)
*Stefan Edelkamp*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for planning missions for multiple agents in graphs with self-updating goal assignments, offering near-optimal solutions in continuous cases and polynomial-time solutions in discrete variants, contrary to the NP-hard nature of traditional vehicle routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address multi-agent mission planning with dynamic goal assignment in undirected graphs (e.g., grids), where the solver autonomously handles goal allocation updates, unlike traditional multi-agent path-finding that requires pre-specified assignments.

Method: For continuous cases (point agents in the Euclidean plane), the problem is solved arbitrarily close to optimal. For discrete variants with node and edge conflicts, a polynomial-time solution is developed, implemented via a planner that finds conflict-free optimized routes using strategies like global assignment, ants-on-the-stick concepts, local assignment problems, path interleaving, and destination 'kicking'.

Result: The approach enables efficient mission planning, with global assignment strategies significantly reducing conflicts and the remaining conflicts resolved effectively through the proposed techniques.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates unexpected tractability for discrete multi-agent assignment and routing in graphs, providing a practical planner that outperforms traditional NP-hard vehicle routing methods, paving the way for more scalable and adaptive multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we plan missions for a fleet of agents in undirected graphs, such as grids, with multiple goals. In contrast to regular multi-agent path-finding, the solver finds and updates the assignment of goals to the agents on its own. In the continuous case for a point agent with motions in the Euclidean plane, the problem can be solved arbitrarily close to optimal. For discrete variants that incur node and edge conflicts, we show that it can be solved in polynomial time, which is unexpected, since traditional vehicle routing on general graphs is NP-hard. We implement a corresponding planner that finds conflict-free optimized routes for the agents. Global assignment strategies greatly reduce the number of conflicts, with the remaining ones resolved by elaborating on the concept of ants-on-the-stick, by solving local assignment problems, by interleaving agent paths, and by kicking agents that have already arrived out of their destinations

*Saisab Sadhu,Ashim Dhor*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: HPO uses structured adversarial debate between pedagogical critics to improve LLMs' educational reasoning, outperforming GPT-4o on math dialogues with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs as tutors often fail at pedagogical reasoning, such as validating incorrect student solutions or giving overly direct answers, limiting their effectiveness in educational settings where resources are constrained.

Method: Hierarchical Pedagogical Oversight (HPO) framework adapts structured adversarial synthesis: specialist agents distill dialogue context, enabling a moderated five-act debate between opposing pedagogical critics, unlike cooperative systems that drift to superficial consensus.

Result: On the MRBench dataset of 1,214 middle-school math dialogues, the 8B-parameter model achieves Macro F1 of 0.845, outperforming GPT-4o (0.812) by 3.3% while using 20 times fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Adversarial reasoning is a critical mechanism for deploying reliable, low-compute pedagogical oversight in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automated tutors to address educator shortages; however, they often fail at pedagogical reasoning, frequently validating incorrect student solutions (sycophancy) or providing overly direct answers that hinder learning. We introduce Hierarchical Pedagogical Oversight (HPO), a framework that adapts structured adversarial synthesis to educational assessment. Unlike cooperative multi-agent systems that often drift toward superficial consensus, HPO enforces a dialectical separation of concerns: specialist agents first distill dialogue context, which then grounds a moderated, five-act debate between opposing pedagogical critics. We evaluate this framework on the MRBench dataset of 1,214 middle-school mathematics dialogues. Our 8B-parameter model achieves a Macro F1 of 0.845, outperforming GPT-4o (0.812) by 3.3% while using 20 times fewer parameters. These results establish adversarial reasoning as a critical mechanism for deploying reliable, low-compute pedagogical oversight in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: To address sample inefficiency in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Method: Multi Agent Reflective Policy Optimization with reflection mechanism and asymmetric clipping mechanism based on KL divergence.

Abstract: We propose Multi Agent Reflective Policy Optimization (MARPO) to alleviate the issue of sample inefficiency in multi agent reinforcement learning. MARPO consists of two key components: a reflection mechanism that leverages subsequent trajectories to enhance sample efficiency, and an asymmetric clipping mechanism that is derived from the KL divergence and dynamically adjusts the clipping range to improve training stability. We evaluate MARPO in classic multi agent environments, where it consistently outperforms other methods.

Conclusion: Reinforcement Networks unify hierarchical, modular, and graph-structured views of MARL, providing a principled foundation for designing and training complex multi-agent systems. It opens directions for richer graph morphologies, compositional curricula, and graph-aware exploration, positioning it as a new line of research in scalable, structured MARL.

Abstract: Modern AI systems often comprise multiple learnable components that can be naturally organized as graphs. A central challenge is the end-to-end training of such systems without restrictive architectural or training assumptions. Such tasks fit the theory and approaches of the collaborative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) field. We introduce Reinforcement Networks, a general framework for MARL that organizes agents as vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure extends hierarchical RL to arbitrary DAGs, enabling flexible credit assignment and scalable coordination while avoiding strict topologies, fully centralized training, and other limitations of current approaches. We formalize training and inference methods for the Reinforcement Networks framework and connect it to the LevelEnv concept to support reproducible construction, training, and evaluation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several collaborative MARL setups by developing several Reinforcement Networks models that achieve improved performance over standard MARL baselines. Beyond empirical gains, Reinforcement Networks unify hierarchical, modular, and graph-structured views of MARL, opening a principled path toward designing and training complex multi-agent systems. We conclude with theoretical and practical directions - richer graph morphologies, compositional curricula, and graph-aware exploration.

TL;DR: This paper explores heterogeneity in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by defining, quantifying, and applying it through a categorization, a distance metric, and a dynamic parameter sharing algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneity in MARL is important for agent functions, policy diversity, and environment interaction, but lacks rigorous definition and deeper analysis.

Method: The authors model MARL at the agent level, categorize heterogeneity into five types with mathematical definitions, define a heterogeneity distance with a quantification method, and design a heterogeneity-based multi-agent dynamic parameter sharing algorithm.

Result: Case studies show the method effectively identifies and quantifies agent heterogeneity, and experiments indicate the algorithm outperforms other parameter sharing baselines in interpretability and adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enhances understanding of heterogeneity in MARL and supports practical algorithm development.

Abstract: Heterogeneity is a fundamental property in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which is closely related not only to the functional differences of agents, but also to policy diversity and environmental interactions. However, the MARL field currently lacks a rigorous definition and deeper understanding of heterogeneity. This paper systematically discusses heterogeneity in MARL from the perspectives of definition, quantification, and utilization. First, based on an agent-level modeling of MARL, we categorize heterogeneity into five types and provide mathematical definitions. Second, we define the concept of heterogeneity distance and propose a practical quantification method. Third, we design a heterogeneity-based multi-agent dynamic parameter sharing algorithm as an example of the application of our methodology. Case studies demonstrate that our method can effectively identify and quantify various types of agent heterogeneity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, compared to other parameter sharing baselines, has better interpretability and stronger adaptability. The proposed methodology will help the MARL community gain a more comprehensive and profound understanding of heterogeneity, and further promote the development of practical algorithms.
