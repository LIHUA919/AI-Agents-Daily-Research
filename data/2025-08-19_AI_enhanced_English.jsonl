We show that standard temporal contrastive learning,\ndespite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its\nreliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial\nRepresentations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative\nsampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate\ntemporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex\ntemporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the\nRubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial\nstates and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS,\nthough with longer solutions.
