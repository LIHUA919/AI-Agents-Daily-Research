Recently,\ndiffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though\ntheir advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we\nsystematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where\ntraining involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they\nsignificantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.\nDiffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation\nloss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as\nimplicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse\ndistribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed\nleft-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and\nderive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which\ndiffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not\ncompute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to\nthe standard AR paradigm.

Federated split learning (FSL) can train sub-models in parallel\nand reduce the computational burden of edge devices by splitting the model\narchitecture. However, it still requires a high communication overhead due to\ntransmitting the smashed data and gradients between clients and the server in\nevery global round. Furthermore, the server must maintain separate partial\nmodels for every client, leading to a significant storage requirement. To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes a novel communication and storage\nefficient federated split learning method, termed CSE-FSL, which utilizes an\nauxiliary network to locally update the weights of the clients while keeping a\nsingle model at the server, hence avoiding frequent transmissions of gradients\nfrom the server and greatly reducing the storage requirement of the server.\nAdditionally, a new model update method of transmitting the smashed data in\nselected epochs can reduce the amount of smashed data sent from the clients. We\nprovide a theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL, rigorously guaranteeing its\nconvergence under non-convex loss functions.
