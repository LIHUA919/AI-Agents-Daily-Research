We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on\nour causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets\nand demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses.

This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and\nproposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the\nautomated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective\nphysicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is\nfine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient\nconversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including\nProfessionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual\nDistraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from\nthe LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on\nmultidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The\nresults show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\\% accuracy, with\nmajor criteria items over 90\\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a\nsolution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests\nthe viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human\npreferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports\nmore robust assessment and judgment practices.

This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal\nsegmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these\nlimitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of\nexisting RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on\ncomplex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet\nintroduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex\nplane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training\nperformance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and\nreal-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of\n98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued\ncounterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet\nachieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,\ncompared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up\nto a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness\nof complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training\nefficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments.

While post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques\neffectively reduce memory overhead, existing methods predominantly rely on\nstatic quantization strategies, which struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads.\nTo address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework\nthat optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging\nmodel perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, FlexQuant\nenables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically\nadjusts bit-widths during each token generation. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive analysis of quantization strategies, introduces a precision\nrequirement model for optimal switching, and implements efficient fine-grained\nprecision management. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexQuant achieves\na 1.3x end-to-end speedup across diverse language tasks with negligible\naccuracy loss introduced. This framework offers a flexible and adaptive\nsolution for efficient LLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlexQuant is a dynamic precision-switching framework for LLMs that optimizes speed and accuracy by adjusting bit-widths during token generation, achieving a 1.3x speedup with minimal accuracy loss.", "motivation": "Address the memory bottleneck in LLMs caused by the gap between model scaling and hardware capabilities, overcoming limitations of static quantization methods.", "method": "Uses model perplexity entropy and KL divergence for layer-wise mixed-precision quantization, dynamically adjusting bit-widths per token.", "result": "Achieves 1.3x speedup across language tasks with negligible accuracy loss.", "conclusion": "FlexQuant provides a flexible, adaptive solution for efficient LLM deployment."}}

Semivalues have been\nproposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as\ndetermining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or\nfiltering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on\nthe specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar\nscore.

BAC achieves lossless action generation\nacceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block\nlevel, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly\nacross timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose\nthe Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps\nby maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped\nfeatures. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant\nerror surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly\nwithin Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop\nthe Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the\nupstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs.

In the case of online learning, when\nnew information is introduced, it can disrupt previously stored data and alter\nthe model's overall paradigm, especially with non-stationary data sources.\nTherefore, it is crucial for neural systems to quickly adapt to new paradigms\nwhile preserving essential past knowledge relevant to the overall problem. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel training algorithm for neural networks called\n\\textit{Lyapunov Learning}. This approach leverages the properties of nonlinear\nchaotic dynamical systems to prepare the model for potential regime shifts.\nDrawing inspiration from Stuart Kauffman's Adjacent Possible theory, we\nleverage local unexplored regions of the solution space to enable flexible\nadaptation. The neural network is designed to operate at the edge of chaos,\nwhere the maximum Lyapunov exponent, indicative of a system's sensitivity to\nsmall perturbations, evolves around zero over time.\n  Our approach demonstrates effective and significant improvements in\nexperiments involving regime shifts in non-stationary systems. In particular,\nwe train a neural network to deal with an abrupt change in Lorenz's chaotic\nsystem parameters. The neural network equipped with Lyapunov learning\nsignificantly outperforms the regular training, increasing the loss ratio by\nabout $96\\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces Lyapunov Learning, a novel training algorithm for neural networks to handle regime shifts and non-stationary time series by leveraging chaotic dynamical systems and operating at the edge of chaos.", "motivation": "Addressing the challenge of neural networks adapting to new paradigms in non-stationary data while preserving past knowledge.", "method": "Proposes Lyapunov Learning, inspired by nonlinear chaotic systems and Stuart Kauffman's Adjacent Possible theory, to prepare models for regime shifts by operating at the edge of chaos.", "result": "Demonstrates significant improvement (96% loss ratio increase) in handling abrupt parameter changes in Lorenz's chaotic system compared to regular training.", "conclusion": "Lyapunov Learning effectively enhances neural networks' adaptability to regime shifts in non-stationary environments."}}
