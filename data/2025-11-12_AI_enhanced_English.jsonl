This study explores the application of multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for dynamic scheduling in soft planning of the RMS settings. In the proposed framework, deep Qnetwork (DQN) agents trained in centralized training learn optimal job machine assignments in real time while adapting to stochastic events such as machine breakdowns and reconfiguration delays. The model also incorporates a negotiation with an attention mechanism to enhance state representation and improve decision focus on critical system features. Key DQN enhancements including prioritized experience replay, nstep returns, double DQN and soft target update are used to stabilize and accelerate learning. Experiments conducted in a simulated RMS environment demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline heuristics in reducing makespan and tardiness while improving machine utilization. The reconfigurable manufacturing environment was extended to simulate realistic challenges, including machine failures and reconfiguration times.

PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space.

Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions.

We propose an emblematic case where advanced analysis (ML/Big Data) must necessarily be subsequent to the verification of basic methodological coherence. This study highlights a crucial cautionary principle: sophisticated analyses amplify, rather than correct, severe methodological flaws rooted in basic design choices, leading to misleading or contradictory findings. By applying simple, standard descriptive statistical methods and established national epidemiological benchmarks to a recently published cohort study on vaccine outcomes and psychiatric events, we expose multiple, statistically irreconcilable paradoxes. These paradoxes, including an implausible risk reduction for a chronic disorder in a high-risk group and contradictory incidence rate comparisons, definitively invalidate the reported hazard ratios (HRs). We demonstrate that the observed effects are mathematical artifacts stemming from an uncorrected selection bias in the cohort construction.

At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings.

In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations.

Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age.

This is especially a concern in vision-based environments where minor manipulations of high-dimensional image inputs can easily mislead the agent's behavior. To this end, various defenses have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art approaches achieving robust performance even under large state perturbations. However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy.
