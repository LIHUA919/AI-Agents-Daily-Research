It is constructed with LLM pipelines\nfor discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing\ninformation in concise fair-use facts. \\ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million\npairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.\nSMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,\nCLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets\nand evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \\ourdataset~is\nhighly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised\nprediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M\nlearnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and\nclassification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.\nModels built with \\ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for\nnovel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly\nas effective. We release our dataset at\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},\nand will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
