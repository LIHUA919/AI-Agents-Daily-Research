### [1] [Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21490)
*Tin Dizdarević,Ravi Hammond,Tobias Gessler,Anisoara Calinescu,Jonathan Cook,Matteo Gallici,Andrei Lupu,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to address the challenges of human-AI coordination in Hanabi, using human proxy agents for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seamless coordination between AI and humans is critical but challenging. Hanabi, with its complex requirements, serves as an ideal testbed, but human evaluation is costly and hard to reproduce.

Method: The authors develop human proxy agents from a large-scale human dataset to serve as evaluation partners in AH2AC2. They also open-source a limited dataset of 3,079 Hanabi games.

Result: Baseline results for two- and three-player Hanabi scenarios are presented. Proxy agents are hosted in a controlled system for fair evaluation.

Conclusion: AH2AC2 provides a robust, reproducible, and cost-effective framework for advancing human-AI coordination research, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of AI safety, emphasizing the need for a trusted ecosystem to ensure AI is trustworthy, reliable, and secure. It highlights the 2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI) and its role in synthesizing research priorities in AI safety, building on the International AI Safety Report.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the debate on ensuring AI safety as AI capabilities and autonomy advance, fostering a trusted ecosystem to balance innovation and avoid backlash.

Method: The method involves organizing AI safety research into three domains: Development (trustworthy AI systems), Assessment (risk evaluation), and Control (monitoring and intervention post-deployment), based on a defence-in-depth model.

Result: The report synthesizes research priorities in AI safety, supported by international collaboration and backed by 33 governments, providing a structured approach to AI safety challenges.

Conclusion: The conclusion underscores the necessity of a trusted AI ecosystem and structured research priorities to ensure AI safety, leveraging international cooperation for effective solutions.

Abstract: Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of
transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI
is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem
is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives
maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.
  The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific
Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing
together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research
priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI
Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By
adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research
domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems
(Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and
challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

### [3] [MAGPIE: A dataset for Multi-AGent contextual PrIvacy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20737)
*Gurusha Juneja,Alon Albalak,Wenyue Hua,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLM-based agents' understanding of contextual privacy and their ability to preserve user privacy in multi-turn conversations, revealing significant shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy is critical in LLM-based agent collaborations, but existing benchmarks lack complexity. The study aims to assess contextual privacy understanding and task performance under privacy constraints.

Method: Introduces MAGPIE, a benchmark with 158 high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains, and evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-2.7-Sonnet) on privacy classification and multi-turn conversation performance.

Result: Current models misclassify private data as shareable (25.2%-43.6%) and disclose private information in multi-turn conversations (50.5%-59.9%). Multi-agent systems fail in 71% of scenarios.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents lack robust contextual privacy understanding and struggle to balance privacy preservation with task completion, highlighting a need for improved alignment.

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

*Xinye Tang,Haijun Zhai,Chaitanya Belwal,Vineeth Thayanithi,Philip Baumann,Yogesh K Roy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dynamic context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications improves prompt quality by combining contextual analysis, knowledge grounding, and adaptive ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-powered apps rely on high-quality prompts, which are hard to craft for domain-specific tasks. This system aims to simplify prompt creation.

Method: Uses contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive ranking. Includes behavioral telemetry and two-stage reasoning.

Result: Achieves high usefulness and relevance, validated by automated and expert evaluations.

Conclusion: The system effectively enhances prompt quality for domain-specific applications.

Abstract: LLM-powered applications are highly susceptible to the quality of user
prompts, and crafting high-quality prompts can often be challenging especially
for domain-specific applications. This paper presents a novel dynamic
context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications.
Our solution combines contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge
grounding, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive skill ranking to
generate relevant and actionable prompt suggestions.
  The system leverages behavioral telemetry and a two-stage hierarchical
reasoning process to dynamically select and rank relevant skills, and
synthesizes prompts using both predefined and adaptive templates enhanced with
few-shot learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves high usefulness and relevance, as validated by both automated
and expert evaluations.

*Chenkai Sun,Denghui Zhang,ChengXiang Zhai,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for projecting societal impacts of language model advice and a dataset for testing long-term safety awareness, showing improved performance on safety benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure beneficial societal impact of language model-based agents in high-stakes decisions by understanding and mitigating far-reaching implications of their suggestions.

Method: Proposes a proof-of-concept framework for projecting model-generated advice's societal propagation and introduces a dataset of 100 indirect harm scenarios to test long-term safety awareness.

Result: Achieves over 20% improvement on the new dataset and a 70% win rate against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework and dataset offer a promising direction for developing safer language model agents.

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks
(AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer
agents.

### [6] [Unveiling Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: Reality or Mirage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21215)
*Haoang Chi,He Li,Wenjing Yang,Feng Liu,Long Lan,Xiaoguang Ren,Tongliang Liu,Bo Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that LLMs only perform shallow (level-1) causal reasoning and lack human-like (level-2) reasoning. It introduces CausalProbe-2024 to test this and proposes G^2-Reasoner to enhance LLMs' causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs, moving beyond shallow reasoning to human-like (level-2) reasoning.

Method: Analyzes LLMs' autoregression mechanism, introduces CausalProbe-2024 benchmark, and proposes G^2-Reasoner, which integrates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts.

Result: LLMs perform poorly on CausalProbe-2024, confirming level-1 reasoning. G^2-Reasoner significantly improves their causal reasoning, especially in fresh and counterfactual contexts.

Conclusion: The work highlights a path for LLMs to achieve genuine causal reasoning, advancing from level-1 to level-2.

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

### [7] [World-aware Planning Narratives Enhance Large Vision-Language Model Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21230)
*Junhao Shi,Zhaoye Fei,Siyin Wang,Qipeng Guo,Jingjing Gong,Xipeng QIu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WAP enhances LVLMs for embodied planning by integrating environmental understanding, improving task success rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with complex, unfamiliar environments and multi-step goals due to environment-agnostic learning.

Method: WAP framework introduces four cognitive capabilities (visual appearance, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, syntactic grounding) using curriculum learning.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL shows 60.7% absolute improvement in task success, excelling in commonsense reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0).

Conclusion: WAP outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, demonstrating the value of environmental awareness in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

### [8] [IXAII: An Interactive Explainable Artificial Intelligence Interface for Decision Support Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21310)
*Pauline Speckmann,Mario Nadj,Christian Janiesch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IXAII is an interactive explainable AI system offering tailored explanations from four methods (LIME, SHAP, Anchors, DiCE) for diverse user groups, enhancing transparency and user control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc explainable AI methods are static and lack user-centric design, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Developed IXAII, an interactive system with four explanation methods, tailored views for five user groups, and user control over content and format.

Result: Evaluated via expert and lay user interviews; IXAII was perceived as helpful for increasing transparency.

Conclusion: IXAII bridges gaps between explainable AI methods, interactivity, and practical use, advancing AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed,
most are static and neglect the user perspective, limiting their effectiveness
for the target audience. In response, we developed the interactive explainable
intelligent system called IXAII that offers explanations from four explainable
AI methods: LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. Our prototype provides tailored
views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'
content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts
and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different
explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to
increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,
interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on
AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

### [9] [Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21329)
*Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI architecture for scientific discovery by addressing three gaps: abstraction, reasoning, and reality, emphasizing causal models, continuous calibration, and human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems are limited in scientific discovery due to brittle reasoning and separation from experimental reality. The paper aims to bridge these gaps to enable transformative AI-driven science.

Method: The proposed architecture includes causal self-supervised models, Bayesian planners, knowledge graphs, and closed-loop interaction with simulators and labs, integrating human judgment.

Result: The framework enables AI systems to simulate, reason causally, and refine knowledge through real-world interaction, grounded in empirical validation.

Conclusion: Scientific discovery AI requires closing key gaps and integrating human judgment, with discovery emerging from interplay between internal models and external validation.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

### [10] [TableMoE: Neuro-Symbolic Routing for Structured Expert Reasoning in Multimodal Table Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21393)
*Junwen Zhang,Pu Chen,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMoE is a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts architecture designed for robust multimodal table understanding, outperforming existing models on challenging WildStruct benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with complex, degraded, or nested table structures (WildStruct conditions), leading to poor performance and generalization.

Method: TableMoE uses Neuro-Symbolic Routing to predict token roles and dynamically route elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML, Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code). It leverages the TableMoE-Align dataset (1.2M quadruples) for pretraining.

Result: TableMoE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on WildStruct benchmarks (WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA, WMMTabDialog, WMMFinanceMath). Ablation studies confirm the importance of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and expert alignment.

Conclusion: Integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning enhances robustness and interpretability for multimodal table understanding, as demonstrated by TableMoE's success.

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

*Baiqiao Yin,Qineng Wang,Pingyue Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Kangrui Wang,Zihan Wang,Jieyu Zhang,Keshigeyan Chandrasegaran,Han Liu,Ranjay Krishna,Saining Xie,Manling Li,Jiajun Wu,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MindCube, a benchmark to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) on spatial mental modeling, revealing their near-random performance. It proposes a 'map-then-reason' approach, boosting accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve VLMs' ability to form spatial mental models, akin to humans, for reasoning about unseen spaces.

Method: Uses MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images. Evaluates VLMs on cognitive mapping, perspective-taking, and mental simulation. Tests approaches like unseen views, reasoning chains, and cognitive maps. Introduces 'map-then-reason' and reinforcement learning.

Result: Accuracy improved from 37.8% to 60.8% with 'map-then-reason' and further to 70.7% with reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Scaffolding spatial mental models with structured representations and flexible reasoning enhances VLMs' understanding of unobservable space.

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mind2Web 2 introduces a benchmark for evaluating agentic search systems, proposing an Agent-as-a-Judge framework to assess complex, long-horizon tasks. The best system achieves 50-70% of human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate the complexity and open-endedness of agentic search systems, necessitating a new benchmark and evaluation method.

Method: Mind2Web 2 includes 130 realistic tasks requiring web browsing and synthesis. An Agent-as-a-Judge framework with task-specific judges assesses correctness and source attribution.

Result: OpenAI Deep Research achieves 50-70% of human performance in half the time, demonstrating potential.

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2 provides a rigorous foundation for future agentic search system development and benchmarking.

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

TL;DR: PsyLite, a lightweight AI-driven psychological counseling model, improves dialogue safety, professionalism, and deployment efficiency using hybrid training and conditional RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address deficiencies in existing AI-driven psychological counseling models, such as dialogue safety, scenario handling, and deployment constraints.

Method: Developed using InternLM2.5-7B-chat, with two-stage training (hybrid distillation fine-tuning and ORPO optimization) and conditional RAG for humor and safety.

Result: Outperforms baselines in CEval, CPsyCounE (47.6% improvement), and SafeDialBench (2.4% improvement), with efficient deployment (5GB memory).

Conclusion: PsyLite offers a practical, high-performance solution for AI-driven psychological counseling in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological
counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of
mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue
safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.

Method: SAFL organizes FL based on dataset size characteristics across multi-modal data, evaluated on 13 diverse datasets.

Result: SAFL achieves 87.68% average accuracy, with structured data reaching 99%+, and reduces data transfer to 7.38 GB.

Conclusion: SAFL provides insights into data-driven FL strategies, offering practical guidance for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for
distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing
approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation
techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size
characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces
Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training
framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset
size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive
experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities
(vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal)
reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500
samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance
hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly
outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic
performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL
achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured
data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior
communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558
communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring
framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization,
network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in
understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning
strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for
real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

*Ugo Lomoio,Tommaso Mazza,Pierangelo Veltri,Pietro Hiram Guzzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-ABIN is a user-friendly, explainable framework for anomaly detection in biological networks, combining machine learning and deep learning to identify disease-related gene anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust, interpretable tools to analyze complex omics data and identify disease-driving genes.

Method: Integrates SVM, Random Forests, GAEs, and GAANs in a unified platform for anomaly detection in gene networks.

Result: Successfully applied to bladder cancer and coeliac disease, uncovering biologically relevant anomalies.

Conclusion: E-ABIN provides accurate, interpretable anomaly detection, aiding in understanding disease mechanisms.

Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust
analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets
while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial
intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns
distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements
in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes
potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene
anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible
graphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable
framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines
classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a
unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of
anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating
algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders
(GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a
high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the
utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease,
where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers
insights into disease mechanisms.

### [16] [On Context-Content Uncertainty Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20699)
*Xin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), a framework for inference under uncertainty, and develops a layered computational approach with four hierarchical operational principles, demonstrating efficiency gains through simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified theoretical foundation for how brains and machines minimize uncertainty by aligning high-entropy contexts with low-entropy content.

Method: Develops a computational framework with four hierarchical layers: Core Inference Constraints, Resource Allocation Principles, Temporal Bootstrapping Dynamics, and Spatial Hierarchical Composition, supported by formal theorems and simulations.

Result: Shows efficiency gains in CCUP-aligned inference through computational simulations and establishes a dependency lattice among principles.

Conclusion: CCUP offers a unified foundation for understanding uncertainty minimization in brains and machines, emphasizing recursive structure-specificity alignment and cycle-consistent entropy resolution.

Abstract: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference
under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and
content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with
low-entropy, structured content. In this paper, we develop a layered
computational framework that derives operational principles from this
foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as
directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that
favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four
hierarchical layers of operational principles: (\textbf{L1}) \emph{Core
Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric
inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,
all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation
Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,
and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping
Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;
and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates
these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and
planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among
principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of
CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for
understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive
structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It
is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and
specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

### [17] [Diffusion Tree Sampling: Scalable inference-time alignment of diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20701)
*Vineet Jain,Kusha Sareen,Mohammad Pedramfar,Siamak Ravanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS) and its greedy variant, DTS*, to improve inference-time alignment in diffusion models by reusing past computations and refining value estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for adapting pretrained diffusion models suffer from inaccurate value estimation and inefficient compute use, limiting sample quality and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a tree-based approach inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search, propagating rewards back through the diffusion chain and iteratively refining value estimates.

Result: DTS matches baseline FID with 10x less compute on MNIST and CIFAR-10, while DTS* finds high-reward samples with 5x less compute in text-to-image and language tasks.

Conclusion: DTS and DTS* provide scalable, anytime algorithms for inference-time alignment, improving sample quality with additional compute.

Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time
remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods
suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which
biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve
sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the
success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting
inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We
introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target
density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and
iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our
proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact
samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its
greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search
for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation,
DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less
compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$
effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to
$5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we
get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better
samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of
diffusion models.

*Kin Kwan Leung,Rasa Hosseinzadeh,Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends the theoretical foundation of FLIPD, a state-of-the-art LID estimator for diffusion models, proving its correctness under realistic assumptions and exploring its applicability with uniform convolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the incomplete theoretical underpinnings of FLIPD, which was previously proven only under unrealistic affine submanifold assumptions, and to explore its broader applicability.

Method: The authors formally prove FLIPD's correctness under realistic assumptions and extend the analysis to uniform convolutions.

Result: FLIPD is validated under realistic conditions, and its analogous applicability with uniform convolutions is demonstrated.

Conclusion: The work strengthens FLIPD's theoretical foundation and broadens its practical relevance, including potential applications with uniform convolutions.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional
ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional
submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with
progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this
process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,
and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.
For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively
expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic
dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari
et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID
to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to
the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID
estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify
the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,
adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art
performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete
since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly
unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap
by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.
Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions
are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Motivation: To determine if test-time scaling methods for LLMs, successful in math, apply to advanced physics and to improve performance by leveraging problem structure.

Method: Developed a symbolic weak-verifier framework for physics problems, evaluated on TPBench and AIME.

Result: The novel method significantly outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench and is effective on AIME.

Conclusion: Step-wise symbolic verification is powerful for complex scientific problems, bridging gaps between domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex
reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with
comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether
the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced
theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on
the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on
AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel,
symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our
empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms
existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method
on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical
problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification
for tackling complex scientific problems.

TL;DR: Foundation models (FMs) are revolutionizing materials science by enabling scalable, general-purpose AI systems. This survey covers their applications, tools, datasets, and challenges, while outlining future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the transformative potential of FMs in materials science, addressing diverse research challenges and enabling cross-domain generalization.

Method: A comprehensive survey of FMs, including a task-driven taxonomy for six application areas, review of datasets, tools, and experimental platforms, and analysis of limitations.

Result: Early successes of FMs are noted, but challenges like generalizability, interpretability, and data imbalance persist.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and trustworthiness to advance FMs in materials science.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials
science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI
systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models,
which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs
offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their
versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research
challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and
computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven
taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction,
interpretation and Q\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials
structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization;
and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and
multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents.
Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous
experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration
of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation
models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in
generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and
limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions
centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and
trustworthiness.

### [21] [Multiple Streams of Relation Extraction: Enriching and Recalling in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20746)
*Todd Nief,David Reber,Sean Richardson,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how fine-tuned LLMs store and recall relation information, proposing dynamic weight-grafting to analyze extraction and recall pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where and how fine-tuned LLMs store and retrieve relation information, addressing gaps in existing localization methods.

Method: Dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained models to trace information pathways.

Result: Fine-tuned models extract relation info during entity processing and recall it later; pathways vary in necessity and sufficiency.

Conclusion: The recall pathway involves task-specific attention and relation extraction in final layers, revealing redundancy and component roles.

Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases,
corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when
the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or
are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g.
activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to
replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill
this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained
language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract
relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and
(2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In
some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned
information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway
alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these
information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy
they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the
``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a
relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward
networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

*Huangyuan Su,Mujin Kwun,Stephanie Gil,Sham Kakade,Nikhil Anand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenges of training large language models using block-scaled precision formats (e.g., MX formats), identifying stochastic instabilities in loss at larger compute scales. It proposes a model for these instabilities and evaluates stabilization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of training large language models by leveraging lower-precision arithmetic formats, while understanding and mitigating their instability issues.

Method: Trains nearly 1,000 language models with varying precision formats, conducts controlled experiments on a proxy model, and proposes interventions to stabilize training.

Result: Identifies multiplicative gradient bias as a cause of instabilities and shows hybrid precision configurations can recover performance comparable to full-precision training.

Conclusion: Hybrid precision schemes can mitigate training instabilities in block-scaled formats, offering a viable path for efficient large-scale model training.

Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that
must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is
collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly
support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)
formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a
shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and
perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency
gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of
block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one
thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from
$2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad
range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe
that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the
loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we
conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that
exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural
settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a
simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the
quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of
activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention
experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be
averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these
findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that
certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with
full-precision training. We release our code at
https://github.com/Hither1/systems-scaling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent score-based generative AI framework is proposed for stochastic, non-local closure models in nonlinear dynamical systems, addressing computational challenges in multiscale systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model complex multiscale dynamical systems without clear scale separation, where resolving all scales is computationally expensive, e.g., in turbulent flows.

Method: Joint training of convolutional autoencoders with conditional diffusion models in latent spaces to reduce dimensionality while preserving physical characteristics.

Result: The framework achieves computational acceleration with comparable predictive accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

Conclusion: The proposed stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models offers an efficient and accurate solution for closure modeling in computational mechanics.

Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning
stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear
dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key
challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear
scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively
expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure
modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale
phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in
regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of
diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure
modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical
applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this
limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional
diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the
dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical
characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach
helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small
reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model
in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed
stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves
significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive
accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPD is a scalable and robust alternative to APD for decomposing neural networks, addressing computational and hyperparameter issues while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like APD are impractical due to high computational costs and hyperparameter sensitivity, limiting their application to larger models.

Method: Introduces Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD), which is more scalable and robust than APD, and avoids issues like parameter shrinkage.

Result: SPD successfully decomposes larger and more complex models, identifies ground truth mechanisms better, and avoids parameter shrinkage.

Conclusion: SPD enables scaling linear parameter decomposition to larger models, advancing mechanistic interpretability research.

Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into
simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter
decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues
with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into
a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main
method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is
impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to
hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter
Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to
hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are
slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We
also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned
parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By
bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this
demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic
interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition
methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing
our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing GPU kernels is complex, especially for newer or less-documented architectures, requiring extensive expertise and experimentation. This paper aims to automate and democratize the process.

Method: The methodology uses LLMs in a multi-stage evolutionary process: selecting prior code versions, generating optimization hypotheses, and autonomously implementing experiments with timing feedback.

Result: Quantitative results are embargoed, but the paper presents the design, workflow, and qualitative insights, showcasing LLM-driven potential for GPU optimization.

Conclusion: LLM-driven agents can democratize and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, particularly in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often
demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative
experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or
less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are
scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an
automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a)
strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new
iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on
existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c)
autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and
subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed
timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the
challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to
compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were
embargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design,
operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of
LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization,
especially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to deploy LSTMs on FPGAs using the FINN framework, addressing computational complexity and enabling efficient real-time deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNNs, especially LSTMs, are computationally complex, making real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments challenging. FPGAs offer energy-efficient acceleration but lack generalized tools for LSTM deployment.

Method: Leverages the FINN framework and ONNX's Scan operator to model LSTM computations, enabling mixed quantization and hardware mapping via custom transformations in the FINN compiler.

Result: The quantised ConvLSTM accelerator achieves balanced performance and resource use, matching or outperforming state-of-the-art models in accuracy with reduced precision.

Conclusion: The proposed flow generalizes LSTM deployment on FPGAs, paving the way for resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for
time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction.
However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time
deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising
platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target
feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom
implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the
open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment
of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open
Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of
LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and
functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom
transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation
graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and
Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM
model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and
generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting
the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator
through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource
consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of
state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the
generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for
resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, and DES are computationally expensive and struggle with heterogeneous data distributions.

Method: Hellsemble partitions data into difficulty circles, passing misclassified instances to specialized models, and uses a router to assign new instances based on difficulty.

Result: Outperforms classical ensemble methods on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks.

Conclusion: Instance-level difficulty is key for efficient and robust ensemble systems.

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance,
but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble
selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to
heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose
Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary
classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and
inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of
difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models
to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each
model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router
model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on
inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results
on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often
outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing
instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing
efficient and robust ensemble systems.

*Furkan Mumcu,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method detects adversarial examples in DNNs by analyzing layer-wise attack impacts, using a lightweight regression model for efficient real-time detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods against adversarial attacks are either ineffective or computationally inefficient, prompting the need for a practical detection approach.

Method: The proposed method trains a regression model to predict deeper-layer features from early layers, using prediction errors to detect adversarial samples.

Result: The method is highly effective, efficient for real-time use, compatible with any DNN, and applicable across domains like image, video, and audio.

Conclusion: The proposed detection approach offers a practical and universal solution to adversarial example detection in DNNs.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the

*Xin Huang,Chul-Ho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates performance degradation in distributed GNN training for link prediction, identifies causes (graph partitioning and negative sampling), and proposes SpLPG to reduce communication costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most distributed GNN frameworks focus on node classification, leaving link prediction underexplored. Performance degrades due to partitioned subgraphs and negative sampling.

Method: The paper introduces SpLPG, leveraging graph sparsification to mitigate performance degradation and reduce communication costs.

Result: Experiments show SpLPG reduces communication overhead by up to 80% while preserving link prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: SpLPG effectively addresses performance degradation in distributed GNN training for link prediction with minimal accuracy loss and significant communication savings.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related
problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of
GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node
classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored.
This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by
investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a
GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire
graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the
information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing
negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph
information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction
accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which
effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance
degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several
public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which
reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving
link prediction accuracy.

Result: Both DDPG and SAC are effective, with SAC showing better stability and sample efficiency. NSGA-II provides an upper bound on the Pareto front.

Conclusion: The study advances adaptive cognitive radar systems by efficiently balancing competing objectives.

Abstract: The time allocation problem in multi-function cognitive radar systems focuses
on the trade-off between scanning for newly emerging targets and tracking the
previously detected targets. We formulate this as a multi-objective
optimization problem and employ deep reinforcement learning to find
Pareto-optimal solutions and compare deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)

effectiveness of both algorithms in adapting to various scenarios, with SAC
showing improved stability and sample efficiency compared to DDPG. We further
employ the NSGA-II algorithm to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front of
the considered problem. This work contributes to the development of more
efficient and adaptive cognitive radar systems capable of balancing multiple

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA fine-tuning reduces memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning while maintaining task performance, diverging from trends in pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of memorization in fine-tuning, especially for LoRA, a parameter-efficient method, and compare it with full fine-tuning.

Method: Examined memorization using a similarity-based metric across different fine-tuning strategies, focusing on LoRA.

Result: LoRA fine-tuning significantly lowers memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, despite model scale and data duplication not following pre-training trends.

Conclusion: LoRA fine-tuning is a safer alternative for reducing memorization risks without compromising performance.

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong
task performance.

applications, tackling tasks beyond human reach. In this paper, we introduce
Omniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that

novel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and
lightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It
can predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit

need for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of
predictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RWFT is a lightweight unlearning method that erases a class from a trained classifier without retraining, outperforming existing methods in metrics and robustness to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enforce user deletion rights and mitigate biased predictions without costly retraining.

Method: Output-reweighting technique redistributing probability mass for forgotten class predictions, robust to MIA-NN attacks.

Result: Matches retraining results, gains 2.79% in prior metrics and 111.45% in new TV-based metric.

Conclusion: RWFT effectively unlearns classes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in performance and attack resilience.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

*Erfan Hajihashemi,Yanning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm is proposed to dynamically select effective models, reducing computational complexity and prediction set size while maintaining coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in multi-model online conformal prediction, such as computational complexity and poor performance due to irrelevant models, by refining model selection dynamically.

Method: Uses a bipartite graph to identify effective models at each time step, selecting models based on feedback (prediction set size and model loss) to construct smaller prediction sets.

Result: Ensures valid coverage and achieves sublinear regret, with experiments showing smaller prediction sets and outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm improves efficiency and performance in multi-model online conformal prediction, validated by real and synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a
prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a
predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift,
multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and
leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the
improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges.
A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the
computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with
poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to
unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a
subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a
bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then
selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced
computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we
demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss,
can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets
while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms
are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments
on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct
smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal
prediction approaches.

*Tong Zeng,Srivathsan Badrinarayanan,Janghoon Ock,Cheng-Kai Lai,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework autonomously infers chemical process constraints and optimizes performance without predefined bounds, achieving faster convergence and better efficiency than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods rely on well-defined constraints, which are often unavailable or ill-defined, leading to subjective heuristics. This work addresses this bottleneck.

Method: Uses a multi-agent framework with specialized LLM agents for constraint generation, validation, simulation, and optimization. It operates in two phases: autonomous constraint generation and iterative optimization.

Result: Validated on hydrodealkylation, the framework matched conventional methods in performance but with 31x faster convergence (under 20 minutes). It also demonstrated domain-informed reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework is promising for poorly characterized processes, offering efficiency and sophisticated understanding, especially for emerging or retrofit applications.

Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency
and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based
solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become
impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,
requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible
parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present
a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously
infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then
collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our
AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized
agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,
and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint
generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent
optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational
bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and
yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance
with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in
under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond
computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates
sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,
and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant
potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly
characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit
applications.

*Matthew Zurek,Guy Zamir,Yudong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, focusing on single-policy guarantees and general weakly communicating MDPs, introducing a novel algorithm with sharp empirical-span-based penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges like distribution shift and non-uniform coverage in average-reward MDPs, which are underexplored theoretically, and improve upon restrictive assumptions in prior work.

Method: The authors propose an algorithm using pessimistic discounted value iteration with quantile clipping, enabling sharper penalties without prior parameter knowledge.

Result: They achieve the first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline RL and handle general weakly communicating MDPs, with lower bounds nearly matching their results.

Conclusion: The work distinguishes single-policy complexity measures, showing coverage assumptions beyond the target policy's stationary distribution are necessary, and provides a novel algorithm with sharp guarantees.

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which
presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and
non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical
perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under
single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional
complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform
mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy,
specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the
first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline
RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs,
contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve
this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration
enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a
sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not
require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we
show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage
assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy,
distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined
cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

### [38] [Interpretable Representation Learning for Additive Rule Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20927)
*Shahrzad Behzadimanesh,Pierre Le Bodic,Geoffrey I. Webb,Mario Boley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends traditional rule ensembles by introducing learnable sparse linear transformations to improve model accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule ensembles rely on axis-parallel decision regions, which require curated features for accuracy. This limits interpretability when complex rules are needed.

Method: The authors propose using sparse linear transformations (e.g., $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$) and a sequential greedy optimization method based on iteratively reweighted logistic regression.

Result: Experiments show the method achieves comparable test risk to state-of-the-art methods while reducing model complexity on ten benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enhances interpretability and accuracy by enabling oblique decision regions without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction
models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on
conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input
variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel
polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of
interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the
gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of
expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of
axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such
features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and
complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the
model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical
propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,
i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where
$\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as
general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using
sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation
of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as
state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across
ten benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DL-LIME, a modified LIME method that integrates deep learning into the sampling process to address feature correlation issues, applied to radar resource management for improved explainability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The 'black box' nature of neural networks in deep reinforcement learning and the limitations of LIME's sampling process, which ignores feature correlations, motivate the development of DL-LIME for better explainability and decision-making insights.

Method: The authors propose DL-LIME, a modified LIME approach that incorporates deep learning into the sampling process to account for feature correlations, and apply it to deep reinforcement learning for radar resource management.

Result: DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME in fidelity and task performance, providing clearer insights into decision-making factors for radar resource management.

Conclusion: DL-LIME enhances explainability and performance in deep reinforcement learning for radar resource management, offering a more reliable and interpretable XAI method.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making
processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional
approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM).
However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature
and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI)
techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One
promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).
However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between
features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates
deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We
employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource
management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME
in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior
performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors
are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

TL;DR: AbMEGD is a novel framework for antibody design using multi-scale equivariant graph diffusion, improving accuracy and structural integrity for complex antigens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational methods struggle with geometric feature capture and generalization for novel antigen interfaces, limiting antibody design efficacy.

Method: AbMEGD integrates multi-scale equivariant graph diffusion, combining atomic-level geometric features with residue-level embeddings for sequence-structure co-design.

Result: AbMEGD outperforms DiffAb with a 10.13% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32% improvement percentage, and 0.062 Å reduction in RMSD for CDR-H3.

Conclusion: AbMEGD sets a new benchmark for antibody design, balancing structural integrity and functionality, with potential for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic
development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces.
Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing
geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel
antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to
accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework
integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging
advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric
features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and
global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method
ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust
generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the
SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\%
rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square
deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading
antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance
structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark
for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in long-horizon goal-conditioned RL, such as sparse rewards and subgoal infeasibility, by introducing a structured approach.

Method: Uses Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE) with decoupled exploration and failure-aware path refinement to ensure subgoal reachability and efficient planning.

Result: SSE outperforms existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL methods in efficiency and success rate across benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSE provides a robust solution for long-horizon tasks by enforcing strict subgoal execution and refining planning dynamically.

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards
are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions,
they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We
introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL
framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally
constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a
decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored
regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which
refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to
observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability.
Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that
SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL
approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

TL;DR: A regret-aware method for unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning, improving efficiency and diversity by framing skill discovery as a min-max game and using a learnable skill generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for skill discovery focus on diversity but lack efficiency, especially in high-dimensional scenarios. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: Proposes a regret-aware method that treats skill discovery as a min-max game, using temporal representation learning and a learnable skill generator to guide exploration.

Result: Outperforms baselines in efficiency and diversity, achieving a 15% zero-shot improvement in high-dimensional environments.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances exploration and policy learning, enhancing skill discovery in complex environments.

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable
behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they
focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information
optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform
well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for
the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a
min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware
method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered
skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight
behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the
policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored
while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an
implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and
guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid
degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill
generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities
and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms
baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15%
zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing
methods.

TL;DR: MSA, a new algorithm, leverages model checkpoints to efficiently undo the influence of problematic datapoints in large language models, outperforming existing unlearning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often contain problematic data (private, copyrighted, or inaccurate), and retraining is computationally expensive. Unlearning algorithms aim to address this but face challenges in precision.

Method: Proposes MSA, which uses model checkpoints to estimate and undo the influence of specific datapoints without full retraining.

Result: MSA outperforms existing unlearning algorithms across benchmarks, models, and metrics.

Conclusion: MSA offers a flexible and efficient solution for data erasure in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may
include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data
that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic
datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model
on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally
prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to
eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving
the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and
undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In
this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the
influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts
capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine
unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation
metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more
flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FeDa4Fair, a library for benchmarking fairness in Federated Learning (FL) under heterogeneous data bias, addressing limitations in current fairness methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in FL is compromised by biases in local datasets, with existing solutions often limited to single, binary sensitive attributes, neglecting diverse client needs.

Method: The authors propose FeDa4Fair, a library for generating tabular datasets to evaluate fairness-aware FL methods, including four bias-heterogeneous datasets and benchmarking tools.

Result: The paper provides datasets and tools for controlled evaluation of fairness methods, aiming to enhance robustness and reproducibility in FL fairness research.

Conclusion: FeDa4Fair enables consistent benchmarking of fairness in FL, addressing gaps in current methods and supporting diverse client fairness needs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key
concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated
system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that
are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing
solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a
single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and
sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited
perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the
different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in
FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at
both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways:

### [45] [Interpretable Hierarchical Concept Reasoning through Attention-Guided Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21102)
*David Debot,Pietro Barbiero,Gabriele Dominici,Giuseppe Marra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H-CMR is a new Concept-Based Model (CBM) that enhances interpretability for both concept and task predictions using a hierarchical, rule-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CBMs lack interpretability in concept predictions, relying on black-box neural networks. H-CMR aims to address this by providing transparency in both concept and task predictions.

Method: H-CMR uses a learned directed acyclic graph to model concept relationships, with edges as logic rules. It employs neural attention to select and apply rules hierarchically for predictions.

Result: H-CMR achieves state-of-the-art performance and supports human interaction through concept and model interventions, improving accuracy and data efficiency.

Conclusion: H-CMR advances CBMs by offering interpretability at both concept and task levels, enabling better human interaction and performance.

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide
interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These
models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task.
However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task
prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via
black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for
both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts
using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that
define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a
neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then
applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental
results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while
enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The
former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter
can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is
available.

*Yifan Yang,Zhen Zhang,Rupak Vignesh Swaminathan,Jing Liu,Nathan Susanj,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SharpZO is a hybrid method combining sharpness-aware warm-up training with zeroth-order optimization to improve VLM fine-tuning without backpropagation, achieving better accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BP-free fine-tuning methods for VLMs often underperform due to reliance on high-variance strategies like ES or ZO optimization.

Method: SharpZO uses a two-stage process: sharpness-aware ES for global exploration and smoothing, followed by sparse ZO optimization for local search, all without backpropagation.

Result: SharpZO outperforms state-of-the-art forward-only methods by up to 7% in accuracy and improves convergence speed.

Conclusion: SharpZO effectively addresses the limitations of BP-free VLM fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for edge devices.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance
across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients
through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained,
inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has
explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often
rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO)
approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM
fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a
two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally
explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization,
followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire
optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly
improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over
state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an antifragile RL framework using discounted Thompson sampling (DTS) to dynamically select robust policies, improving adaptability to adversarial attacks in UAV navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust RL methods lack generalization to out-of-distribution shifts, limiting their effectiveness against evolving adversarial strategies.

Method: The framework derives diverse robust policies, models them as a multiarmed bandit problem, and uses DTS to dynamically select policies, minimizing distributional shifts.

Result: The antifragile approach outperforms conventional robust RL methods, achieving shorter path lengths and higher conflict-free navigation rates in simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed antifragile RL framework enhances adaptability to adversarial attacks, demonstrating superior performance in complex UAV navigation scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in
reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing
robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited
generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value
distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To
address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that
enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a
switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism
dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially
induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first
derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range
of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a
multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in
response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving
adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by
optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,
results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus
inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with
multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected
gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,
non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior
performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of
conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

*Steven Walton,Valeriy Klyukin,Maksim Artemev,Denis Derkach,Nikita Orlov,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores knowledge distillation techniques for improving smaller normalizing flows, enhancing sampling quality and density estimation while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of training explicit density models like normalizing flows, which are difficult to train and have lower sampling quality, the study investigates knowledge distillation to improve smaller models.

Method: The authors propose novel knowledge distillation techniques for compositional normalizing flows, leveraging non-traditional knowledge transfer within intermediate layers.

Result: The distillation process enables smaller student models to achieve significant performance gains over non-distilled counterparts, with increased throughput due to fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation in normalizing flows offers a promising approach to balance model size, performance, and efficiency.

Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for
generative models because of their ability to better model probability
distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to
their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable
inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply
interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability
distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more
difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective
functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In
this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase
sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows.
We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional
Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these
architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a
non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that
knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation,
we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance
gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a
proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of
bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

### [49] [Curriculum-Guided Antifragile Reinforcement Learning for Secure UAV Deconfliction under Observation-Space Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21129)
*Deepak Kumar Panda,Adolfo Perrusquia,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An antifragile RL framework is proposed to counteract OOD adversarial attacks in UAV navigation, improving resilience and performance under attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL policies in safety-critical systems like UAVs are vulnerable to OOD adversarial attacks, degrading performance and safety.

Method: The framework uses incremental adversarial perturbations and Wasserstein distance minimization for critic alignment.

Result: The antifragile policy outperforms baselines, achieving higher rewards and fewer conflicts under attacks.

Conclusion: The approach is viable for secure RL in evolving threat environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,
such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are
vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation
space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade
value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the
existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an
antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental
adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which
incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which
enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD
observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a
theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic
forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with
increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as
the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under
which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through
iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance
minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically
evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D
obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms
standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient
descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative
reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the
practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for
secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat
scenarios.

*Feng Jiang,Mangal Prakash,Hehuan Ma,Jianyuan Deng,Yuzhi Guo,Amina Mollaysa,Tommaso Mansi,Rui Liao,Junzhou Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIDENT integrates molecular SMILES, text, and taxonomic data for rich molecular representations, using volume-based and local alignment objectives for state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works overlook textual and taxonomic information in molecular representation learning, limiting the richness of learned features.

Method: TRIDENT combines SMILES, text, and taxonomic annotations, employing volume-based global alignment and local substructure-text alignment, balanced dynamically.

Result: TRIDENT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating SMILES, text, and taxonomic data enhances molecular property prediction, demonstrating the value of multimodal learning.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical
structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely
overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation
learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular
SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn
rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive
dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional
annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT
employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features
at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities.
Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that
captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their
corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically
balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad
functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the
value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for
molecular property prediction.

*Ziwei Wang,Hongbin Wang,Tianwang Jia,Xingyi He,Siyang Li,Dongrui Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DBConformer, a dual-branch convolutional Transformer network, improves EEG decoding by integrating temporal and spatial modeling, outperforming baselines with fewer parameters and offering interpretable features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-based EEG decoding struggles with long-range dependencies and inter-channel relationships, while hybrid models like Conformers lack optimal local-global feature integration and explicit channel-wise modeling.

Method: Proposes DBConformer, combining a temporal Conformer for long-range dependencies and a spatial Conformer for inter-channel interactions, enhanced by a channel attention module.

Result: Outperforms 10 baselines on five MI and two seizure detection datasets, with 8x fewer parameters than EEG Conformer, and yields physiologically interpretable features.

Conclusion: DBConformer is reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding, validated by superior performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform
spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external
communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream
backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it
difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel
relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address
this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration
of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch
convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a
temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial
Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal
dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention
module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven
importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)
datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings
demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline
models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG
Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the
features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned
with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability
of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code
is publicized at https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer.

*Haodong Lu,Chongyang Zhao,Jason Xue,Lina Yao,Kristen Moore,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoRA introduces a fine-grained Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach for continual learning, addressing interference, redundancy, and ambiguous routing by decomposing rank updates into rank-1 components and enabling sparse, adaptive rank selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome catastrophic forgetting and task interference in continual learning with large pre-trained models, particularly addressing issues in existing LoRA-based MoE methods.

Method: MoRA decomposes rank-r updates into r rank-1 components, treats each as an independent expert, and uses self-activated sparse rank activation with rank pruning and activation budgets for adaptive selection.

Result: MoRA significantly enhances continual learning with pre-trained models, improving generalization and mitigating forgetting, validated on CLIP and LLMs.

Conclusion: MoRA effectively addresses key challenges in continual learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution for fine-grained expert utilization.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by
catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and
freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and
ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design
introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts
per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful
components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or
contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks
and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features
across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As
more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating
forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with
self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple
low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,
each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1
expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid
ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own
relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning
and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per
input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large
language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain
forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant
effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while
mitigating forgetting.

*Silas Dobler,Florian Lemmerich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel linearity-based compression method for neural networks, achieving lossless compression to 1/4 of original size, compatible with existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance neural network compression by leveraging linear behavior in ReLU-like activations for merging layers.

Method: Uses linearity-based compression to merge layers where neurons behave linearly due to ReLU-like activations.

Result: Achieves lossless compression to 1/4 of original model size, works well with pruned models.

Conclusion: Introduces a new compression method for smaller, more efficient neural networks, compatible with other techniques.

Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary
parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly
optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel
way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that
with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated
behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the
theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally.
Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original
model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on
already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between
different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful
combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type
of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural
network models.

TL;DR: This paper addresses concept drift in federated learning (FL) by proposing an algorithm to mitigate performance degradation, validated through experiments on Raspberry Pi4 devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting distributions, causing performance degradation (concept drift) in FL, which is commonly trained on static datasets.

Method: The paper models concept drift as a Markov chain, introduces the Stationary Generalization Error, and proposes an algorithm regularizing empirical risk minimization with KL divergence and mutual information.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches for periodic, gradual, and random drift patterns, as confirmed by experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively adapts to concept drift in FL, enhancing long-term performance and demonstrating a clear performance-cost tradeoff.

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable training of large models on decentralized clusters with slow networks, overcoming the reliance on fast centralized interconnects.

Method: Combines Pipeline Parallelism, Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local Training, and Adaptive Gradient Compression.

Result: Successfully pre-trains a 107B model on a 1Gbps network with 357x speedup over AllReduce and negligible convergence degradation.

Conclusion: DiLoCoX is the first decentralized framework for 100B+ parameter models, proving feasibility on slow networks.

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100
billion parameters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RL-Selector, a reinforcement learning-based method for efficient data selection by leveraging epsilon-sample cover to reduce redundancy and improve training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep architectures on large datasets is computationally expensive, and real-world datasets often contain redundancies. Existing data selection methods overlook dynamic sample relationships during training.

Method: The authors propose RL-Selector, a lightweight RL agent that optimizes data selection using epsilon-sample cover as a reward signal, capturing inter-sample relationships and dataset dynamics.

Result: RL-Selector outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, enhancing model generalization and training efficiency across diverse architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that dynamic data selection using RL and epsilon-sample cover effectively reduces redundancy and improves training efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on
these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world
datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more
data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate
redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing
training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically
rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined
effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We
introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample
redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic
structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a
reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a
lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging
epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward
signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse
architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show
enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

TL;DR: NANOADAM dynamically updates small-magnitude weights during finetuning, improving efficiency and performance while reducing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning large pretrained models is resource-intensive. Observing that large gradients correlate with small-magnitude weights, the authors aim to optimize finetuning by selectively updating these weights.

Method: NANOADAM updates only small-magnitude weights during finetuning, a gradient-free approach that avoids gradient computation for parameter selection.

Result: NANOADAM allows larger learning rates, reduces catastrophic forgetting, and improves generalization in NLP and vision tasks.

Conclusion: NANOADAM is an efficient and effective method for finetuning large models, leveraging weight-magnitude patterns to enhance performance.

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be
resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate
this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model
parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during
finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated
with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning
settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we
propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights
during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this
criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without
gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are
likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing
the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger
learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in
experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency fraud detection is challenged by complex transaction patterns and class imbalance, with traditional methods lacking in capturing temporal and structural dependencies.

Method: ATGAT includes a temporal embedding module, a triple attention mechanism (structural, temporal, global), and weighted BCE loss to handle imbalance.

Result: ATGAT achieves an AUC of 0.9130, outperforming XGBoost, GCN, and GAT by 9.2%, 12.0%, and 10.0% respectively.

Conclusion: ATGAT enhances fraud detection with its temporal and attention mechanisms, offering a reliable tool for financial institutions and generalizability to other anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of
increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance.
Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture
temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper
proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that
enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced
temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with
periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention
mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context
attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance.
Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT
achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best
traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This
method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and
triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides
financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its
design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection
tasks.

Motivation: Existing FL methods focus on real drift but fail to handle virtual or label drift, leading to catastrophic forgetting. Distinguishing drift sources is crucial for optimal adaptation.

Method: FedDAA integrates three modules: cluster number determination, real drift detection, and concept drift adaptation, ensuring optimal clustering and selective knowledge retention.

Result: FedDAA improves accuracy by 7.84%-8.52% over state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: FedDAA effectively addresses multi-source concept drift in FL by distinguishing drift types and preserving valuable historical data, enhancing generalization and performance.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change
over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as
concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift
(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the
input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution
P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily
focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these
methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading
to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different
sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift
calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from
retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a
general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To
address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework
designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable
historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster
number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real
drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and
a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful
historical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and
experiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

*Colin Samplawski,Adam D. Cobb,Manoj Acharya,Ramneet Kaur,Susmit Jha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScalaBL introduces a scalable Bayesian low-rank adaptation method for LLMs, achieving competitive performance with minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of uncertainty quantification in LLMs, especially in high-stakes domains, due to their tendency to hallucinate and poor calibration.

Method: Performs Bayesian inference in an r-dimensional subspace using LoRA parameters as projection matrices, enabling scalable stochastic variational inference.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while requiring only ~1000 additional parameters and scales to larger LLMs.

Conclusion: ScalaBL offers a scalable and efficient solution for Bayesian uncertainty quantification in LLMs, advancing the field significantly.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method uses knowledge graphs to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs, improving their tool utilization and problem-solving abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching LLMs to use tools effectively is challenging due to insufficient quality of instruction data generated by LLMs themselves.

Method: Extracts query pathways from knowledge graphs, transforms them into user queries, and translates entity relationships into actionable tools and solution steps.

Result: Fine-tuning on synthetic data from knowledge graphs significantly enhances LLMs' tool utilization and overall capabilities.

Conclusion: Knowledge graphs provide a robust solution for generating high-quality instruction data, improving LLM performance with minimal fine-tuning.

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving
their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However,
effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding
of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on
LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often
insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs
to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are
manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting
various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into
a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between
entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into
detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of
LLMs.

*Gavin Lee Goodship,Luis Miralles-Pechuan,Stephen O'Sullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Reinforcement Learning approach optimizes low-storage ESRK methods, achieving 25% runtime reduction while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing accuracy, stability, and efficiency in high-order, low-storage ESRK methods is challenging. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics or exhaustive searches.

Method: Combines GA for search-space exploration and RL for dynamic heuristic refinement, validated on benchmark problems like Brusselator systems and Navier-Stokes equations.

Result: 25% runtime reduction in IPOPT compared to traditional ESRK methods, with preserved fourth-order accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: The GA-RL framework improves resource efficiency in simulations and expands the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods, paving the way for future heuristic optimization research.

Abstract: Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving
large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including
weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling.
However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains
challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study
introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)
approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK
methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed
heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven
mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition
mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic
parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly
improving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation
framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems,
including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes
equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT
runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining
numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of
adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity
simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in
real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other
demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic
optimisation for numerical methods, opening pathways for further exploration
using Deep RL and AutoML-based heuristic search

TL;DR: CHOOSE is a shallow Transformer framework enhanced with Chain of Thought (CoT) for wireless symbol detection, improving performance without increasing model depth, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Transformer models for wireless communication tasks are storage and computationally expensive, limiting deployment on mobile devices.

Method: Introduces autoregressive latent reasoning steps (CoT) in hidden space to enhance reasoning capacity of shallow (1-2 layer) Transformers.

Result: Outperforms conventional shallow Transformers and matches deep models' performance while remaining efficient.

Conclusion: CHOOSE offers a lightweight, efficient solution for deploying Transformer-based algorithms in resource-constrained wireless receivers.

Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems,
particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks
through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based
Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve
satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational
costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a
CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By
introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space,
CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2
layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight
Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models,
making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional
shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep
Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This
represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms
in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

*Francesco Vitale,Nicola Dall'Ora,Sebastiano Gaiardelli,Enrico Fraccaroli,Nicola Mazzocca,Franco Fummi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An unsupervised fault diagnosis method for CPSs combines anomaly detection, process mining, and stochastic simulation to automate fault modeling and improve interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual fault modeling in CPSs is complex and error-prone, requiring domain expertise. This work aims to automate and simplify the process.

Method: The approach integrates multivariate time-series analysis for anomaly detection, process mining for model extraction, and stochastic simulation for root cause analysis.

Result: Validated on the Robotic Arm Dataset, the method effectively models and classifies faults, aiding predictive maintenance and digital twin development.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enhances fault diagnosis in CPSs by automating model creation and improving interpretability, supporting industrial applications.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring
system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting
anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of
faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models
that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this
challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that
integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process
mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected
from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These
anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the
discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By
incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach
supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root
cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using
the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart
manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling,
simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation
of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the
development of digital twins for industrial environments.

TL;DR: mTSBench is the largest benchmark for multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD), evaluating 24 methods and highlighting gaps in model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTS-AD is challenging due to complex dependencies and sparse labels, necessitating a standardized benchmark for rigorous evaluation.

Method: mTSBench includes 344 labeled time series across 19 datasets, evaluating 24 anomaly detection methods and unsupervised model selection techniques.

Result: No single detector performs best across all datasets, and current model selection methods are suboptimal.

Conclusion: mTSBench enables reproducible comparisons and aims to advance adaptive anomaly detection and robust model selection.

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains
like healthcare, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring, yet remains
challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and
sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for
MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series
across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24
anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors
for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model
selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior
findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets,
underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art
selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench
provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible

### [67] [Learning to Skip the Middle Layers of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21103)
*Tim Lawson,Laurence Aitchison*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel architecture dynamically skips middle Transformer layers using learned gating, but fails to improve efficiency vs. dense baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce redundancy in middle Transformer layers and improve efficiency by skipping them dynamically.

Method: Uses learned gating to skip symmetric spans of central blocks, gated attention to ignore skipped positions, and controls norms/sparsity.

Result: No improvement in validation cross-entropy vs. FLOPs trade-off compared to fewer-layer dense baselines.

Conclusion: The approach doesn't outperform simpler baselines, but code is released for further exploration.

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Unlasting, a framework using Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to address unpaired single-cell perturbation data, integrating GRN and a masking mechanism for improved predictions and introducing a biologically grounded evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-cell sequencing is destructive, leading to unpaired data. Existing methods either force pairings or ignore inherent relationships, limiting accuracy.

Method: Uses DDIB for mapping distributions, integrates GRN for biologically meaningful signal propagation, and employs a masking mechanism for silent gene prediction. Introduces a new evaluation metric for heterogeneity.

Result: Unlasting effectively handles unpaired data, improves prediction quality, and better captures cellular heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The framework advances single-cell perturbation analysis by addressing unpaired data challenges and enhancing biological relevance.

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the
identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting
experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive
process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and
after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and
unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt
to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent
relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges
(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively
addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework
as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)
information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,
and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving
the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same
perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a
bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we
introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual
conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell
perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under
the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve
generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a
biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent
heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

*Weikang Meng,Yadan Luo,Liangyu Huo,Yaowei Wang,Xin Li,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Norm-Aware Linear Attention (NaLaFormer) to address entropy gaps and missing interactions in linear attention by decoupling query and key matrices into norm and direction components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current linear attention methods neglect query norms and inhibit negative values, leading to entropy gaps and missing interactions. The paper aims to restore dynamic spikiness and norm consistency.

Method: Proposes decoupling query and key matrices into norm and direction, using a query-norm aware kernel for dynamic entropy control, and a norm-preserving mapping for non-negativity.

Result: NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks by up to 4.2%, enhancing expressiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of linear attention, achieving better performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by
reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve
two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction,
current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$
normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected
by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily
leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of
query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after
being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware
Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and
recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple
query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve
norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We
mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the
query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel
function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure
norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a
norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into
positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with
opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the
NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both
expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cGAN-based framework generates stealthy adversarial attacks to evade UAV IDS, while a CVAE detects these attacks better than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IDS and OOD detection methods fail against novel and stealthy adversarial attacks, necessitating advanced solutions.

Method: Develop a cGAN to craft stealthy adversarial attacks and a CVAE to detect them using negative log-likelihood.

Result: CVAE outperforms traditional detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats.

Conclusion: Advanced probabilistic modeling is crucial for robust IDS against generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

TL;DR: pFedDC is a personalized federated learning framework using dual-prompt learning and cross fusion to address data heterogeneity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges due to data, computation, and communication heterogeneity. Existing methods overlook joint label-domain shifts and rely only on text prompts.

Method: pFedDC uses dual-prompt learning (global and local prompts for vision and language) and a cross-fusion module to integrate prompts adaptively.

Result: Extensive experiments on nine datasets show pFedDC outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: pFedDC effectively addresses heterogeneity in federated learning by leveraging dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces diverse mini-batch selection in reinforcement learning using determinantal point processes, focusing on drug discovery to improve solution diversity and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating instances in real-world applications like reinforcement learning is costly, and diverse exploration is crucial to avoid mode collapse.

Method: Proposes diverse mini-batch selection using determinantal point processes, tested in drug discovery with molecular generation oracles.

Result: The framework significantly improves solution diversity while maintaining high quality, potentially speeding up drug discovery.

Conclusion: Diverse mini-batch selection enhances exploration in reinforcement learning, particularly beneficial for drug discovery.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is
often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations,
in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more
critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment
(i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn
from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch
can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we
introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose
to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in
the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally
study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical
exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality
solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three
well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps.
Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can
substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining
solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead
to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness in sequential collective decision-making, especially with partial voter turnout.

Method: Integrate Artificial Delegates (preference-learning agents) into perpetual voting systems.

Result: Artificial Delegates mitigate fairness issues caused by absenteeism and enhance robustness.

Conclusion: Artificial Delegates effectively compensate for missing participation in perpetual voting.

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making
by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual
voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information,
assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm. In
this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates,
preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual
voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and
representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to
which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our
findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness,
Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness
across diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient fine-tuning method for LLMs using entropy-based complexity categorization, outperforming standard SFT and matching distillation with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM performance in specific domains without costly distillation or excessive data.

Method: Splits training data by entropy, applies SFT and distillation selectively, and evaluates on small open models.

Result: Outperforms standard SFT (0.55 vs 0.43 accuracy) and matches distillation with 62% less data.

Conclusion: The method offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning and distillation approaches.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

Conclusion: The methods are practical and theoretically promising, potentially becoming standard techniques.

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM
(Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing
their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of
candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields
novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead
principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the
final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame
down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical
contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for
k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve
on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to
outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means
often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon
seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in
iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool
size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to
become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical
perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of
analytical approaches.

*Jiajie Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LPR improves load balancing in MoE models, reducing imbalance and enhancing resource utilization without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE systems face severe load imbalance, underutilizing experts and resources.

Method: Proposes Latent Prototype Routing (LPR), a clustering-based routing framework.

Result: LPR reduces Gini coefficient from 0.70 to 0.035 and improves min-max load ratio to 0.70.

Conclusion: LPR achieves near-perfect load balancing in MoE models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AGTCNet, a novel graph-temporal model for MI-EEG classification, addressing challenges in subject- and session-invariant BCI systems. It outperforms existing methods with improved accuracy, speed, and compactness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing robust BCI systems is challenging due to neural variability and EEG hardware constraints. Existing methods fail to capture spatiotemporal dependencies in EEG signals.

Method: AGTCNet uses topographic EEG electrode configuration and integrates GCAT to learn spatiotemporal EEG representations.

Result: AGTCNet achieved state-of-the-art performance with reduced model size (49.87%), faster inference (64.65%), and higher accuracy (66.82%-90.54%) on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: AGTCNet is effective and practical for BCI deployment, offering superior performance and efficiency in MI-EEG classification.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography
(EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals
to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising
potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems
remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability
of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware
constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,
existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate
spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study
addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional
network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)
classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration
of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional
attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG
representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG
classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact
architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI
deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference
time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy
of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV
Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for
subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset,
AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and
2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further
improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynamicBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle real-time data, outperforming GPT4o by 7.0% (document-free) and 5.8% (document-assisted).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarks lack dynamic evaluation for real-time data processing, limiting LLM assessment in contemporary applications.

Method: DynamicBench uses a dual-path retrieval pipeline (web + local databases) and tests models with/without external documents.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o by significant margins.

Conclusion: DynamicBench effectively evaluates LLMs' real-time data handling and report generation, with public release of code/data.

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on
static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to
capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in
contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and
processing up-to-the-minute data. DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval
pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates
domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within
specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or
withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability
to independently process recent information or leverage contextual
enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system
adept at managing dynamic information synthesis. Our experimental results
confirm the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and
document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively. The code and data
will be made publicly available.

*Le Vu Anh,Mehmet Dik,Nguyen Viet Anh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves a uniform Lipschitz bound for persistent Laplacian eigenvalues, ensuring stability under local updates and enabling reliable error control in dynamic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unknown precise change in a single eigenvalue when a simplex is added, which is crucial for downstream tools relying on these eigenvalues.

Method: Proving a uniform Lipschitz bound for persistent Laplacian eigenvalues, showing they vary by at most twice the Euclidean norm of the simplex's boundary.

Result: Every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary by at most twice the Euclidean norm of the simplex's boundary, independent of filtration scale and complex size.

Conclusion: This provides the first eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis, ensuring stability and reliability in dynamic data settings.

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and
structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology,
physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of
geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work
established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change
in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle,
is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools,
including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly
on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound:
after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary
by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of
filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first
eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis.
It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and
enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SMMILE is the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks, revealing limitations in current MLLMs' ability to learn from context, with performance affected by irrelevant examples and recency bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore multimodal in-context learning (ICL) in medicine, where clinicians adapt to specialized tasks from limited examples, and assess MLLMs' capabilities in this domain.

Method: Introduces SMMILE, a benchmark with 111 expert-curated problems (517 question-image-answer triplets) and SMMILE++ (1038 permuted problems), evaluating 15 MLLMs.

Result: Most MLLMs show moderate to poor ICL ability; ICL improves performance by only 8-9.4%. Irrelevant examples degrade performance by up to 9.5%, and recency bias improves it by up to 71%.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have critical limitations and biases in learning multimodal medical tasks from context, highlighting the need for improved ICL methods.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite
significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely
encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited
examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or
considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question
answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is
largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL
benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each
including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task
demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer
triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further
introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A
comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit
moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended
evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on
SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant
in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade
performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,
i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial
performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical
limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks
from context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance energy efficiency in low-power DNN computing by leveraging hardware approximation techniques while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Method: Systematically distributes ROUP approximate multipliers across DNN layers, filters, and kernels, evaluating impact on accuracy and energy using ResNet-8 on CIFAR-10.

Result: Achieves up to 54% energy savings with ≤4% accuracy loss, outperforming state-of-the-art DNN approximations in energy efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: Fine-grained hardware approximation effectively balances energy efficiency and accuracy in DNNs, offering significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has
established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine
Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this
paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads
in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher
levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate
multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across
the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and
examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the
CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers
up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the
baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better
accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

TL;DR: Early-stopping in-context learning for tabular foundation models improves inference speed by up to 2.2x with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference-time costs of tabular foundation models, especially for larger datasets, necessitate efficiency improvements.

Method: Dynamically evaluate stopping in-context learning after each Transformer layer, using a pre-trained decoder for early exit.

Result: Speedups of 1.3x on small tasks and 2.2x on larger tasks with negligible performance degradation.

Conclusion: Early exiting is a practical strategy to enhance efficiency in tabular in-context learning.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models have shown strong performance across various
tabular learning tasks via in-context learning, offering robust generalization
without any downstream finetuning. However, their inference-time costs remain
high, particularly for larger datasets. To address this, we propose
early-stopping the in-context learning process. We achieve this by dynamically
evaluating whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder
layer. Once stopped, we decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise
decoder. Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early
stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with
negligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we
further evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving
speedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting
as an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular
in-context learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distributed methods struggle with the compute-intensive task of tokenizing and aggregating images from diverse sources, limiting the potential of vision-based scientific models.

Method: Introduces Distributed Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG), compatible with any model-parallel strategy and vision transformer architecture.

Result: Achieved up to 75% memory reduction and more than doubled throughput on 1,024 AMD GPUs.

Conclusion: D-CHAG is a scalable and efficient solution for large-channel datasets, enhancing performance in scientific applications like hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting.

Abstract: Vision-based scientific foundation models hold significant promise for
advancing scientific discovery and innovation. This potential stems from their
ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical
groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal
correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and
aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by
current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed
Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets
with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is
compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer
architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated
D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated
with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75%
reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to
1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSCP is a generative policy for offline RL that combines expressiveness with efficiency by enabling one-shot action generation, avoiding iterative sampling costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high inference costs and training instability of iterative sampling in generative models like diffusion and flow-matching for offline RL.

Method: Proposes SSCP, trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict completion vectors from intermediate samples, enabling one-shot action generation.

Result: SSCP scales effectively across RL settings, offering speed and adaptability gains over diffusion baselines, and performs well in benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSCP is a versatile, efficient, and expressive framework for deep RL, suitable for offline, online, and goal-conditioned settings.

Abstract: Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive
policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal
action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference
costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling
steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a
generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict
direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate,
one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP
combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and
inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long
backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline,
offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed
and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to
goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures
without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across
standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a
versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential
decision-making.

TL;DR: Multimodal machine learning improves deception detection in dyadic interactions, with late fusion of audio and video data from both participants yielding the best results (71% accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of multimodal techniques in detecting deception, especially in dyadic interactions, and to compare early and late fusion approaches.

Method: Used audio and video data (Action Units and gaze) from Swedish native speakers in truth/lie scenarios, comparing fusion strategies across modalities and participants.

Result: Combining speech and facial data outperformed single-modality methods, and including both participants' data improved accuracy (71% with late fusion).

Conclusion: Multimodal integration, especially late fusion, enhances deception detection, supporting psychological theories and paving the way for future dyadic interaction studies.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of using multimodal machine learning
techniques to detect deception in dyadic interactions, focusing on the
integration of data from both the deceiver and the deceived. We compare early
and late fusion approaches, utilizing audio and video data - specifically,
Action Units and gaze information - across all possible combinations of
modalities and participants. Our dataset, newly collected from Swedish native
speakers engaged in truth or lie scenarios on emotionally relevant topics,
serves as the basis for our analysis. The results demonstrate that
incorporating both speech and facial information yields superior performance
compared to single-modality approaches. Moreover, including data from both
participants significantly enhances deception detection accuracy, with the best
performance (71%) achieved using a late fusion strategy applied to both
modalities and participants. These findings align with psychological theories
suggesting differential control of facial and vocal expressions during initial
interactions. As the first study of its kind on a Scandinavian cohort, this
research lays the groundwork for future investigations into dyadic
interactions, particularly within psychotherapy settings.

TL;DR: A training method for ResNets based on optimal control, penalizing intermediate outputs to prune unnecessary layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between ResNets and optimal control theory, enabling efficient layer pruning.

Method: Penalize intermediate outputs (hidden states) akin to stage costs in optimal control, using skip connections and output layers.

Result: Unnecessary deeper layers' weights vanish, suggesting a theory-grounded pruning strategy.

Conclusion: The approach offers a principled way to prune ResNets by leveraging optimal control principles.

Abstract: We propose a training formulation for ResNets reflecting an optimal control
problem that is applicable for standard architectures and general loss
functions. We suggest bridging both worlds via penalizing intermediate outputs
of hidden states corresponding to stage cost terms in optimal control. For
standard ResNets, we obtain intermediate outputs by propagating the state
through the subsequent skip connections and the output layer. We demonstrate
that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual
layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer
pruning strategy.

TL;DR: Low screening rates for cervical, breast, and oral cancer in Telangana (2020) prompted an ML-based solution to predict susceptibility and improve awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low awareness and screening rates for cervical and breast cancer in Telangana, despite early detection's critical role in reducing mortality.

Method: Developed ML classification models (decision tree for cervical cancer, SVM for breast cancer) to predict susceptibility and integrated a system for locating nearby hospitals and maintaining health records.

Result: A system to predict cancer susceptibility, provide hospital suggestions, and maintain health records, aiming to increase awareness and reduce mortality.

Conclusion: The solution advances cancer awareness and literacy in Telangana, potentially lowering mortality rates through early detection and education.

Abstract: According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for
cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3
percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is
the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness
about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We
developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to
breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to
provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based
on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the
health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct
awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision
tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical
cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by
devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading
cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing
cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

### [90] [Where to find Grokking in LLM Pretraining? Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21551)
*Ziyue Li,Chenrui Fan,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study investigates grokking in large language models (LLMs) during pretraining, revealing delayed generalization and pathway evolution from random to structured patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mysterious phenomenon of grokking (delayed generalization) in LLMs, particularly during pretraining, and uncover its mechanistic explanation.

Method: Analyze training loss and generalization on diverse tasks using a 7B LLM (OLMoE), track pathway evolution, and introduce metrics for pathway distance and complexity.

Result: Grokking occurs in LLM pretraining, with pathways evolving from random to structured, indicating memorization-to-generalization conversion. New metrics predict generalization.

Conclusion: Pathway structure reduces model complexity and improves generalization, offering practical tools for monitoring pretraining performance without testing.

Abstract: Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss
converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the
mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning
mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or
highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of
grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language
model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate
generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code
generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.
  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the
pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter
grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of
generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find
that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve
from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples
during grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the
converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,
providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we
develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a
single pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement
on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely
dependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,
enabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and
test. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model
complexity and improve the generalization bound.
