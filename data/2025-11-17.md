Motivation: Model checking strategic abilities is computationally hard, especially with imperfect information and stochastic environments. Assume-guarantee reasoning can help decompose complex problems into easier subproblems.

Method: Developed several assume-guarantee verification schemes for probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information. Also proposed a new variant of non-probabilistic alternating-time logic with "achieving at most φ" modalities.

Result: Proved soundness of the proposed verification schemes and discussed their completeness properties.

Conclusion: Assume-guarantee verification provides a promising approach to tackle the computational complexity of model checking strategic abilities in imperfect information settings with stochastic environments.

Abstract: Model checking of strategic abilities is a notoriously hard problem, even more so in the realistic case of agents with imperfect information, acting in a stochastic environment. Assume-guarantee reasoning can be of great help here, providing a way to decompose the complex problem into a small set of easier subproblems.
  In this paper, we propose several schemes for assume-guarantee verification of probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information. We prove the soundness of the schemes, and discuss their completeness. On the way, we also propose a new variant of (non-probabilistic) alternating-time logic, where the strategic modalities capture "achieving at most $\varphi$," analogous to Levesque's logic of "only knowing."
