We identify an analogous issue, search-time\ncontamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to\ngather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs\nwhen the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a\nnear-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than\ngenuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that\nHuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among\nretrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often\nexplicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace\nwithin their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:\nHumanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for\napproximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets\nwith ground truth labels on HuggingFace.

In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a\nmodality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse\nmodalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared\nprompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically\nrelated instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared\nprompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of\nadditional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.\nThrough comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual\nbenchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance\nwhile preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our\nresults highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than\nmerely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning."}

However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a\nsingle RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream\ntasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has\nbecome an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a\ncomprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG\nsystems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both\ntheoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical\nanalysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from\nthe perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have\nexplored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.\nWe carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and\nAgentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to\nsolve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating\nmultiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline\nlevel or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on\nthe multi-RAG system ensemble."}

In this paper, we generalize the\nstandard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of\ntwo parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three\nexisting SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be\nunified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further\npropose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into\ndesigning the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class\nseparability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class\ninformation of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is\nchallenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties.

To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round).

Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label\ngeneration and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates\ndiverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms\nexisting baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks\nwhere clients possess valuable private data but limited computational\nresources."}
