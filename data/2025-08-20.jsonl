We identify an analogous issue, search-time\ncontamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to\ngather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs\nwhen the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a\nnear-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than\ngenuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that\nHuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among\nretrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often\nexplicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace\nwithin their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:\nHumanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for\napproximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets\nwith ground truth labels on HuggingFace.

In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a\nmodality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse\nmodalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared\nprompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically\nrelated instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared\nprompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of\nadditional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.\nThrough comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual\nbenchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance\nwhile preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our\nresults highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than\nmerely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning."}

To address this issue, we have conducted a\ncomprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG\nsystems.

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data.

To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset.

This work extends the CASH framework to select and\nadapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit\nadapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed\nbandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to\nefficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via\nin-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying\ncosts of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions\nindividually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing\nstandard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN\ncompared to other bandit and AutoML strategies.

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it\nrequires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which\nneglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,\nand increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label\ngeneration and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates\ndiverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms\nexisting baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks\nwhere clients possess valuable private data but limited computational\nresources."}

Various\ntechniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs,\nwith neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper\ncomprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for\nenhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks\nand give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we\ndiscuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs\nfrom three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic.\nFinally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions. We\nhave also released a GitHub repository including papers and resources related\nto this survey: https://github.com/LAMDASZ-ML/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-with-NeSy."}
