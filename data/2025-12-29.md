*Takahide Suzuki,Kazuki Nakanishi,Takashi Fujiwara,Hideyuki Shimizu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OrchestRA is a multi-agent platform that autonomously executes therapeutic discovery by coordinating biological target identification, chemical structure design, and pharmacological evaluation through dynamic feedback loops and human guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Therapeutic discovery faces challenges due to fragmentation of specialized domains and the execution gap between computational design and physiological validation, while current generative AI models often function as passive assistants rather than autonomous executors.

Method: A human-in-the-loop multi-agent platform with an Orchestrator coordinating three specialized agents: Biologist Agent uses deep reasoning over a massive knowledge graph (>10 million associations) to identify targets; Chemist Agent autonomously detects structural pockets for de novo design or drug repositioning; and Pharmacologist Agent evaluates candidates via rigorous physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations, establishing a dynamic feedback loop for structural reoptimization.

Result: The platform creates a dynamic feedback loop where pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles directly trigger structural reoptimization, enabling autonomous therapeutic discovery with human guidance.

Conclusion: OrchestRA transforms drug discovery from a stochastic search to a programmable evidence-based engineering discipline by integrating autonomous execution with human guidance, thereby democratizing therapeutic design.

Abstract: Therapeutic discovery remains a formidable challenge, impeded by the fragmentation of specialized domains and the execution gap between computational design and physiological validation. Although generative AI offers promise, current models often function as passive assistants rather than as autonomous executors. Here, we introduce OrchestRA, a human-in-the-loop multi-agent platform that unifies biology, chemistry, and pharmacology into an autonomous discovery engine. Unlike static code generators, our agents actively execute simulations and reason the results to drive iterative optimization. Governed by an Orchestrator, a Biologist Agent leverages deep reasoning over a massive knowledge graph (>10 million associations) to pinpoint high-confidence targets; a Chemist Agent autonomously detects structural pockets for de novo design or drug repositioning; and a Pharmacologist Agent evaluates candidates via rigorous physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations. This architecture establishes a dynamic feedback loop where pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles directly trigger structural reoptimization. By seamlessly integrating autonomous execution with human guidance, OrchestRA democratizes therapeutic design, transforming drug discovery from a stochastic search to a programmable evidence-based engineering discipline.

*Shuide Wen,Yu Sun,Beier Ku,Zhi Gao,Lijun Ma,Yang Yang,Can Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study uses multimodal large language models and multi-agent collaboration to standardize interpretation of the House-Tree-Person test, achieving expert-level similarity in interpretations and offering a new approach for digital mental-health services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The House-Tree-Person test faces challenges including heterogeneous scoring standards, reliance on subjective examiner experience, and lack of a unified quantitative coding system. The research aims to address these issues using multimodal large language models.

Method: The study used a multi-agent system with multimodal large language models to interpret House-Tree-Person drawings. It employed quantitative experiments measuring semantic similarity between MLLM and human expert interpretations, and qualitative analyses assessing ecological validity and internal coherence.

Result: Quantitative experiments showed mean semantic similarity of ~0.75 (SD ~0.05) between MLLM and human expert interpretations, increasing to 0.85 in structurally oriented expert datasets. Qualitative analyses demonstrated effective correction of visual hallucinations and production of psychologically valid reports.

Conclusion: The study confirms that multimodal large language models can serve as standardized tools for projective assessment, with the proposed multi-agent framework offering a new paradigm for digital mental-health services by decoupling feature recognition from psychological inference.

Abstract: Background: The House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawing test, introduced by John Buck in 1948, remains a widely used projective technique in clinical psychology. However, it has long faced challenges such as heterogeneous scoring standards, reliance on examiners subjective experience, and a lack of a unified quantitative coding system.
  Results: Quantitative experiments showed that the mean semantic similarity between Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) interpretations and human expert interpretations was approximately 0.75 (standard deviation about 0.05). In structurally oriented expert data sets, this similarity rose to 0.85, indicating expert-level baseline comprehension. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that the multi-agent system, by integrating social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives, effectively corrected visual hallucinations and produced psychological reports with high ecological validity and internal coherence.
  Conclusions: The findings confirm the potential of multimodal large models as standardized tools for projective assessment. The proposed multi-agent framework, by dividing roles, decouples feature recognition from psychological inference and offers a new paradigm for digital mental-health services.

### [3] [A Study of Solving Life-and-Death Problems in Go Using Relevance-Zone Based Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21365)
*Chung-Chin Shih,Ti-Rong Wu,Ting Han Wei,Yu-Shan Hsu,Hung Guei,I-Chen Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis shows RZS-based Go solvers effectively identify critical areas and discover patterns in Life-and-Death problems, but exhibit limitations in evaluating rare patterns and territory optimization compared to human players.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the performance and behavior of advanced computer Go solvers on traditional Life-and-Death problems, comparing their solutions to human expert solutions, and identifying strengths and limitations of current solver techniques.

Method: The study employs state-of-the-art computer Go solvers using Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) and relevance-zone pattern tables to analyze seven Life-and-Death problems from Cho Chikun's 'Life and Death Dictionary'. The method involves running the solvers on these problems, examining the identified relevance zones, discovered patterns, and comparing solutions to the given book answers.

Result: Key findings: (1) Solvers successfully identify relevance zones highlighting critical areas for each problem. (2) They discover a series of patterns, including rare ones. (3) For two problems, solvers find different answers than the book solutions. Issues identified: (a) misjudgment of rare pattern values, (b) preference for direct living over territory maximization, differing from human player behavior.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current Go solvers with RZS techniques can effectively identify critical areas and discover rare patterns in Life-and-Death problems, but they exhibit issues such as misjudging rare pattern values and preferring direct living over territory maximization, unlike human players. The authors propose future work to address these limitations.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the behavior of solving Life-and-Death (L&D) problems in the game of Go using current state-of-the-art computer Go solvers with two techniques: the Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) and the relevance-zone pattern table. We examined the solutions derived by relevance-zone based solvers on seven L&D problems from the renowned book "Life and Death Dictionary" written by Cho Chikun, a Go grandmaster, and found several interesting results. First, for each problem, the solvers identify a relevance-zone that highlights the critical areas for solving. Second, the solvers discover a series of patterns, including some that are rare. Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players. We suggest possible approaches to address these issues in future work. Our code and data are available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/study-LD-RZ.

### [4] [Three-way conflict analysis based on alliance and conflict functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21419)
*Junfang Luo,Mengjun Hu,Guangming Lang,Xin Yang,Keyun Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes separating alliance and conflict functions in three-way conflict analysis to improve interpretability and accuracy in modeling agent relations and strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in interpreting aggregations of functions in three-way conflict analysis. Current approaches use functions that combine opposite aspects, causing ambiguity. For instance, averaging auxiliary functions can produce misleading results where different attitudes yield the same numeric outcome.

Method: The authors propose a method that separates alliance and conflict functions. This allows for more precise modeling of agent relations in three-way conflict analysis. They explore concepts like alliance sets and strategies using this refined framework.

Result: The paper presents a refined approach to modeling agent relations in three-way conflict analysis. This new method separates alliance and conflict functions, enabling better interpretation and more accurate analysis of alliance sets and strategies. A real-world application illustrates the model's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The authors advocate for the separation of opposite aspects in auxiliary functions into separate alliance and conflict functions. This refined model helps solve crucial questions in conflict analysis by more accurately representing agent relations and attitudes. A real-world application demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Trisecting agents, issues, and agent pairs are essential topics of three-way conflict analysis. They have been commonly studied based on either a rating or an auxiliary function. A rating function defines the positive, negative, or neutral ratings of agents on issues. An auxiliary function defines the alliance, conflict, and neutrality relations between agents. These functions measure two opposite aspects in a single function, leading to challenges in interpreting their aggregations over a group of issues or agents. For example, when studying agent relations regarding a set of issues, a standard aggregation takes the average of an auxiliary function concerning single issues. Therefore, a pair of alliance +1 and conflict -1 relations will produce the same result as a pair of neutrality 0 relations, although the attitudes represented by the two pairs are very different. To clarify semantics, we separate the two opposite aspects in an auxiliary function into a pair of alliance and conflict functions. Accordingly, we trisect the agents, issues, and agent pairs and investigate their applications in solving a few crucial questions in conflict analysis. Particularly, we explore the concepts of alliance sets and strategies. A real-world application is given to illustrate the proposed models.

### [5] [Feasible strategies in three-way conflict analysis with three-valued ratings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21420)
*Jing Liu,Mengjun Hu,Guangming Lang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses conflict resolution by proposing weighted consistency/non-consistency measures to identify feasible strategies and optimal solutions, outperforming existing approaches in case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work on three-way conflict analysis focuses on trisecting agent pairs, agents, or issues but falls short in conflict resolution, particularly in formulating feasible strategies which is essential for resolution and mitigation.

Method: Computing overall rating of agent cliques using positive/negative similarity degrees; proposing weighted consistency and non-consistency measures; developing algorithms for identifying feasible strategies, L-order strategies, and optimal ones; applying models to NBA labor negotiations and Gansu Province development case studies; conducting sensitivity and comparative analysis.

Result: The models successfully identified feasible strategies in case studies, with comparative analysis showing superiority over state-of-the-art approaches by systematically identifying both feasible strategies and optimal solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed conflict resolution models outperform conventional approaches by unifying weighted agent-issue evaluation with consistency and non-consistency measures, enabling systematic identification of feasible strategies and optimal solutions.

Abstract: Most existing work on three-way conflict analysis has focused on trisecting agent pairs, agents, or issues, which contributes to understanding the nature of conflicts but falls short in addressing their resolution. Specifically, the formulation of feasible strategies, as an essential component of conflict resolution and mitigation, has received insufficient scholarly attention. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate feasible strategies from two perspectives of consistency and non-consistency. Particularly, we begin with computing the overall rating of a clique of agents based on positive and negative similarity degrees. Afterwards, considering the weights of both agents and issues, we propose weighted consistency and non-consistency measures, which are respectively used to identify the feasible strategies for a clique of agents. Algorithms are developed to identify feasible strategies, $L$-order feasible strategies, and the corresponding optimal ones. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed models, we apply them to two commonly used case studies on NBA labor negotiations and development plans for Gansu Province and conduct a sensitivity analysis on parameters and a comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art conflict analysis approaches. The comparison results demonstrate that our conflict resolution models outperform the conventional approaches by unifying weighted agent-issue evaluation with consistency and non-consistency measures to enable the systematic identification of not only feasible strategies but also optimal solutions.

### [6] [Three-way decision with incomplete information based on similarity and satisfiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21421)
*Junfang Luo,Mengjun Hu,Keyun Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper generalizes three-way decision from complete to incomplete information, introducing new similarity and satisfiability measures, and proposes four new approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend the well-established formulations of three-way decision in rough set theory, which currently handle complete information, to scenarios with incomplete information. This extension is needed because real-world applications often involve incomplete data, making this generalization more practical and applicable.

Method: The method involves a brief review of existing formulations and then generalizing them. For the computational formulation, a new measure of similarity degree of objects is proposed as a generalization of equivalence relations. This leads to two approaches: using alpha-similarity classes and approximability of objects. For the conceptual formulation, a measure of satisfiability degree of formulas is proposed as a quantitative generalization of satisfiability. This leads to two approaches: using alpha-meaning sets of formulas and confidence of formulas.

Result: The paper presents generalizations of both computational and conceptual formulations for three-way decision-making under incomplete information. It introduces new measures: similarity degree of objects and satisfiability degree of formulas. Using these, it develops two approaches per formulation: alpha-similarity classes and approximability for computational; alpha-meaning sets and confidence for conceptual. The results show these new directions are promising.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed new measures and approaches successfully generalize both computational and conceptual formulations for three-way decision-making under incomplete information. It highlights that while similarity classes are commonly used, the introduced concepts of approximability and the two conceptual approaches offer fresh and promising research directions for handling incomplete information in practical applications.

Abstract: Three-way decision is widely applied with rough set theory to learn classification or decision rules. The approaches dealing with complete information are well established in the literature, including the two complementary computational and conceptual formulations. The computational formulation uses equivalence relations, and the conceptual formulation uses satisfiability of logic formulas. In this paper, based on a briefly review of these two formulations, we generalize both formulations into three-way decision with incomplete information that is more practical in real-world applications. For the computational formulation, we propose a new measure of similarity degree of objects as a generalization of equivalence relations. Based on it, we discuss two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-similarity classes and approximability of objects, respectively. For the conceptual formulation, we propose a measure of satisfiability degree of formulas as a quantitative generalization of satisfiability with complete information. Based on it, we study two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-meaning sets of formulas and confidence of formulas, respectively. While using similarity classes is a common method of analyzing incomplete information in the literature, the proposed concept of approximability and the two approaches in conceptual formulation point out new promising directions.

### [7] [LogicLens: Visual-Logical Co-Reasoning for Text-Centric Forgery Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21482)
*Fanwei Zeng,Changtao Miao,Jing Huang,Zhiya Tan,Shutao Gong,Xiaoming Yu,Yang Wang,Huazhe Tan,Weibin Yao,Jianshu Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogicLens: A unified visual-textual co-reasoning framework for text-centric forgery analysis, using Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought and weighted multi-task optimization, achieving SOTA results across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for text-centric forgery analysis are limited to coarse-grained visual analysis and treat detection, grounding, and explanation as separate tasks, ignoring their interconnectedness for holistic improvement.

Method: LogicLens uses a Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) mechanism for iterative cross-validation of visual and textual cues, along with a weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO-based optimization. It includes the PR² pipeline for generating high-quality annotations and leverages the RealText dataset with 5,397 images.

Result: LogicLens outperforms specialized frameworks and GPT-4o in zero-shot evaluations on T-IC13 and other MLLM-based methods on dense-text T-SROIE datasets, demonstrating significant leads in macro-average F1 and other metrics.

Conclusion: LogicLens offers a superior unified framework for text-centric forgery analysis, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and enabling more sophisticated visual-textual co-reasoning.

Abstract: Sophisticated text-centric forgeries, fueled by rapid AIGC advancements, pose a significant threat to societal security and information authenticity. Current methods for text-centric forgery analysis are often limited to coarse-grained visual analysis and lack the capacity for sophisticated reasoning. Moreover, they typically treat detection, grounding, and explanation as discrete sub-tasks, overlooking their intrinsic relationships for holistic performance enhancement. To address these challenges, we introduce LogicLens, a unified framework for Visual-Textual Co-reasoning that reformulates these objectives into a joint task. The deep reasoning of LogicLens is powered by our novel Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) mechanism, which iteratively cross-validates visual cues against textual logic. To ensure robust alignment across all tasks, we further propose a weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO-based optimization. Complementing this framework, we first designed the PR$^2$ (Perceiver, Reasoner, Reviewer) pipeline, a hierarchical and iterative multi-agent system that generates high-quality, cognitively-aligned annotations. Then, we constructed RealText, a diverse dataset comprising 5,397 images with fine-grained annotations, including textual explanations, pixel-level segmentation, and authenticity labels for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LogicLens across multiple benchmarks. In a zero-shot evaluation on T-IC13, it surpasses the specialized framework by 41.4% and GPT-4o by 23.4% in macro-average F1 score. Moreover, on the challenging dense-text T-SROIE dataset, it establishes a significant lead over other MLLM-based methods in mF1, CSS, and the macro-average F1. Our dataset, model, and code will be made publicly available.

*Yanhao Li,Lu Ma,Jiaran Zhang,Lexiang Tang,Wentao Zhang,Guibo Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Leash introduces an adaptive RL framework that dynamically adjusts length penalties to reduce reasoning length by 60% without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on fixed length penalties that are hard to tune and fail to adapt to the evolving reasoning abilities of LLMs, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and conciseness.

Method: The authors formulate length control as a constrained optimization problem and employ a Lagrangian primal-dual method to dynamically adjust the penalty coefficient. This adaptive mechanism guides models toward producing concise reasoning without sacrificing task performance.

Result: Experiments on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 show that Leash reduces the average reasoning length by 60% across diverse tasks while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: The proposed Leash framework demonstrates a practical and effective paradigm for developing controllable and efficient LLMs that balance reasoning capabilities with computational budgets.

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on fixed length penalties, but such penalties are hard to tune and fail to adapt to the evolving reasoning abilities of LLMs, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and conciseness. To address this challenge, we propose Leash (adaptive LEngth penAlty and reward SHaping), a reinforcement learning framework for efficient reasoning in LLMs. We formulate length control as a constrained optimization problem and employ a Lagrangian primal-dual method to dynamically adjust the penalty coefficient. When generations exceed the target length, the penalty is intensified; when they are shorter, it is relaxed. This adaptive mechanism guides models toward producing concise reasoning without sacrificing task performance. Experiments on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 show that Leash reduces the average reasoning length by 60% across diverse tasks - including in-distribution mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution domains such as coding and instruction following - while maintaining competitive performance. Our work thus presents a practical and effective paradigm for developing controllable and efficient LLMs that balance reasoning capabilities with computational budgets.

Method: Fine-tuned Nemotron SLM using llama3.1-nemotron-nano-8B-v1 architecture with LoRA-based models, hyperparameter sweeps (learning rates, optimizers, schedules).

Result: Resolves key performance issues in retrieval, maintains agent quality, demonstrates significant latency/cost improvements.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable framework for optimizing multi-agent systems in e-commerce, leveraging NVIDIA's NeMo for commerce-specific tasks.

Abstract: We present the development and optimization of PayPal's Commerce Agent, powered by NEMO-4-PAYPAL, a multi-agent system designed to revolutionize agentic commerce on the PayPal platform. Through our strategic partnership with NVIDIA, we leveraged the NeMo Framework for LLM model fine-tuning to enhance agent performance. Specifically, we optimized the Search and Discovery agent by replacing our base model with a fine-tuned Nemotron small language model (SLM).
  We conducted comprehensive experiments using the llama3.1-nemotron-nano-8B-v1 architecture, training LoRA-based models through systematic hyperparameter sweeps across learning rates, optimizers (Adam, AdamW), cosine annealing schedules, and LoRA ranks. Our contributions include: (1) the first application of NVIDIA's NeMo Framework to commerce-specific agent optimization, (2) LLM powered fine-tuning strategy for retrieval-focused commerce tasks, (3) demonstration of significant improvements in latency and cost while maintaining agent quality, and (4) a scalable framework for multi-agent system optimization in production e-commerce environments. Our results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Nemotron SLM effectively resolves the key performance issue in the retrieval component, which represents over 50\% of total agent response time, while maintaining or enhancing overall system performance.

Motivation: Existing multimodal models in medicine often produce hallucinations or inconsistent reasoning when integrating clinical text and medical imaging, limiting clinical trust, which motivates the need for a more reliable framework.

Method: The framework includes an input encoder for text and images, a projection module for cross-modal alignment, a reasoning controller that decomposes diagnostic tasks into steps, and a logic tree generator that assembles stepwise premises into verifiable conclusions.

Result: Evaluations on MedXpertQA and other benchmarks show improved diagnostic accuracy and more interpretable reasoning traces on multimodal tasks, while remaining competitive on text-only settings.

Conclusion: The method represents a promising step toward trustworthy multimodal medical AI by enhancing reasoning reliability and interpretability.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine, simply integrating clinical text and medical imaging does not guarantee reliable reasoning. Existing multimodal models often produce hallucinations or inconsistent chains of thought, limiting clinical trust. We propose a diagnostic framework built upon LLaVA that combines vision-language alignment with logic-regularized reasoning. The system includes an input encoder for text and images, a projection module for cross-modal alignment, a reasoning controller that decomposes diagnostic tasks into steps, and a logic tree generator that assembles stepwise premises into verifiable conclusions. Evaluations on MedXpertQA and other benchmarks show that our method improves diagnostic accuracy and yields more interpretable reasoning traces on multimodal tasks, while remaining competitive on text-only settings. These results suggest a promising step toward trustworthy multimodal medical AI.

TL;DR: LLM-based agent for AMS IC I/O generation reduces design time from hours to minutes with 70%+ DRC+LVS pass rate, validated in silicon tape-out.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of connecting natural language design intent with industrial-level AMS IC design deliverables, enabling faster and more reliable I/O subsystem generation.

Method: The framework integrates two key capabilities: (1) a structured domain knowledge base capturing reusable constraints and design conventions; (2) design intent structuring that converts ambiguous user intent into verifiable logic steps using JSON and Python as intermediate formats.

Result: On AMS-IO-Bench benchmark, AMS-IO-Agent achieved over 70% DRC+LVS pass rate and reduced design turnaround time from hours to minutes, outperforming baseline LLM. An agent-generated I/O ring was fabricated and validated in a 28 nm CMOS tape-out.

Conclusion: The AMS-IO-Agent successfully demonstrates the feasibility of LLM-based agents in AMS IC design, achieving human-agent collaboration where the agent completes nontrivial subtasks with outputs directly used in silicon validation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AMS-IO-Agent, a domain-specialized LLM-based agent for structure-aware input/output (I/O) subsystem generation in analog and mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs). The central contribution of this work is a framework that connects natural language design intent with industrial-level AMS IC design deliverables. AMS-IO-Agent integrates two key capabilities: (1) a structured domain knowledge base that captures reusable constraints and design conventions; (2) design intent structuring, which converts ambiguous user intent into verifiable logic steps using JSON and Python as intermediate formats. We further introduce AMS-IO-Bench, a benchmark for wirebond-packaged AMS I/O ring automation. On this benchmark, AMS-IO-Agent achieves over 70\% DRC+LVS pass rate and reduces design turnaround time from hours to minutes, outperforming the baseline LLM. Furthermore, an agent-generated I/O ring was fabricated and validated in a 28 nm CMOS tape-out, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of the approach in real AMS IC design flows. To our knowledge, this is the first reported human-agent collaborative AMS IC design in which an LLM-based agent completes a nontrivial subtask with outputs directly used in silicon.

*Hong Xie,Haoran Gu,Yanying Huang,Tao Tan,Defu Lian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A variant of multiple-play stochastic bandits for resource allocation in LLM/edge intelligence, analyzing regret bounds and algorithm design (MSB-PRS-OffOpt & UCB-based).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address resource allocation in applications like LLM and edge intelligence where arms have stochastic capacities with prioritized sharing, requiring optimized play allocation under nonlinear combinatorial utility.

Method: Propose a model with M arms and K plays, each arm with stochastic capacities and reward, priority weights allocate capacity. Prove regret lower bounds, design MSB-PRS-OffOpt algorithm for optimal policy offline (O(MK^3) complexity), and extend to approximate UCB-based algorithm for online learning.

Result: Instance independent regret lower bound Ω(α₁σ√KMT) and instance dependent Ω(α₁σ²(M/Δ) ln T), with UCB-based algorithm matching bounds up to factors √(K ln KT) and α₁K², addressing computational and learning challenges.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a tailored bandit model for prioritized resource sharing, establishes fundamental regret limits, and provides efficient algorithms (offline and online) with tight performance guarantees, tackling nonlinear optimization in learning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a variant of multiple-play stochastic bandits tailored to resource allocation problems arising from LLM applications, edge intelligence, etc. The model is composed of $M$ arms and $K$ plays. Each arm has a stochastic number of capacities, and each unit of capacity is associated with a reward function. Each play is associated with a priority weight. When multiple plays compete for the arm capacity, the arm capacity is allocated in a larger priority weight first manner. Instance independent and instance dependent regret lower bounds of $Ω( α_1 σ\sqrt{KM T} )$ and $Ω(α_1 σ^2 \frac{M}Δ \ln T)$ are proved, where $α_1$ is the largest priority weight and $σ$ characterizes the reward tail. When model parameters are given, we design an algorithm named \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} to locate the optimal play allocation policy with a computational complexity of $O(MK^3)$. Utilizing \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} as a subroutine, an approximate upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm is designed, which has instance independent and instance dependent regret upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bound up to factors of $ \sqrt{K \ln KT }$ and $α_1 K^2$ respectively. To this end, we address nontrivial technical challenges arising from optimizing and learning under a special nonlinear combinatorial utility function induced by the prioritized resource sharing mechanism.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a responsible and explainable AI agent architecture using multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance to address challenges in autonomy, explainability, and accountability in agentic AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems introduce critical challenges in explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance when their outputs influence downstream decisions. Current implementations focus on functionality and scalability but lack mechanisms for understanding decision rationale or enforcing responsibility across agent interactions.

Method: The paper proposes a responsible and explainable AI agent architecture based on multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance. It uses a consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents that independently generate candidate outputs, followed by a dedicated reasoning agent that consolidates outputs while enforcing constraints and producing auditable decisions.

Result: Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows shows that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance architecture provides a practical solution for building agentic AI systems that balance autonomy and scalability with responsibility and explainability. It offers actionable guidance for production implementation.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks through the coordination of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs), tools, and external services. While these systems enable powerful new capabilities, increasing autonomy introduces critical challenges related to explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance, especially when agent outputs influence downstream actions or decisions. Existing agentic AI implementations often emphasize functionality and scalability, yet provide limited mechanisms for understanding decision rationale or enforcing responsibility across agent interactions. This paper presents a Responsible(RAI) and Explainable(XAI) AI Agent Architecture for production-grade agentic workflows based on multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance. In the proposed design, a consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents independently generates candidate outputs from a shared input context, explicitly exposing uncertainty, disagreement, and alternative interpretations. A dedicated reasoning agent then performs structured consolidation across these outputs, enforcing safety and policy constraints, mitigating hallucinations and bias, and producing auditable, evidence-backed decisions. Explainability is achieved through explicit cross-model comparison and preserved intermediate outputs, while responsibility is enforced through centralized reasoning-layer control and agent-level constraints. We evaluate the architecture across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows, demonstrating that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains. This work provides practical guidance for designing agentic AI systems that are autonomous and scalable, yet responsible and explainable by construction.

### [14] [Compliance Rating Scheme: A Data Provenance Framework for Generative AI Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21775)
*Matyas Bohacek,Ignacio Vilanova Echavarri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework called Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS) and an open-source Python library are introduced to evaluate and ensure ethical and legal compliance in datasets for Generative Artificial Intelligence, addressing transparency, accountability, and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) relies on open-source datasets built through opaque collection, lacking consideration for ethical and legal issues, and information loss during sharing. Most focus is on model development, neglecting dataset-related compliance.

Method: Develop the Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS), a framework assessing transparency, accountability, and security of datasets, and release an open-source Python library based on data provenance for implementation and integration into AI pipelines.

Result: Introduced CRS and an accompanying Python library that can evaluate existing datasets and guide responsible dataset construction, combining reactive and proactive approaches.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap in dataset compliance evaluation, promoting ethical practices in GAI by emphasizing proactive user involvement and adherence to principles.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has experienced exponential growth in recent years, partly facilitated by the abundance of large-scale open-source datasets. These datasets are often built using unrestricted and opaque data collection practices. While most literature focuses on the development and applications of GAI models, the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the creation of these datasets are often neglected. In addition, as datasets are shared, edited, and further reproduced online, information about their origin, legitimacy, and safety often gets lost. To address this gap, we introduce the Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS), a framework designed to evaluate dataset compliance with critical transparency, accountability, and security principles. We also release an open-source Python library built around data provenance technology to implement this framework, allowing for seamless integration into existing dataset-processing and AI training pipelines. The library is simultaneously reactive and proactive, as in addition to evaluating the CRS of existing datasets, it equally informs responsible scraping and construction of new datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A paper introduces the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA), a bi-level AI framework that automates the design of objective functions in scientific discovery to overcome limited proxies, validating its effectiveness across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scientific discovery agents rely on imperfect quantitative objective functions as proxies for complex scientific goals, and there is a need to automate objective function design to enhance discovery capabilities.

Method: SAGA employs a bi-level architecture: an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under these evolving objectives.

Result: The framework is demonstrated in various applications including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation improves the effectiveness of discovery agents.

Conclusion: Automating objective design is a central requirement for advancing scientific discovery agents, and SAGA's approach enables systematic exploration of objectives and trade-offs, leading to substantial improvements over fixed-proxy methods.

Abstract: There has been unprecedented interest in developing agents that expand the boundary of scientific discovery, primarily by optimizing quantitative objective functions specified by scientists. However, for grand challenges in science , these objectives are only imperfect proxies. We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SpatialBench is a benchmark of 146 verifiable problems from spatial transcriptomics workflows to evaluate AI agents' ability to extract biological insights from real datasets, showing current models have low accuracy (20-38%) and performance varies by task and platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial transcriptomics is growing in complexity, but it's unclear if AI agents can handle messy, real-world spatial data to derive biological insights, necessitating a benchmark to measure and diagnose their capabilities.

Method: Created SpatialBench with 146 problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows across five technologies and seven task categories, each including data snapshots and deterministic graders to evaluate recovery of key biological results.

Result: Benchmarking frontier models revealed low base accuracy (20-38%) with significant variations by model-family, model-task, and model-platform interactions, and showed that harness design (tools, prompts, control flow, environment) critically affects performance.

Conclusion: SpatialBench serves as a tool for measuring and improving AI agents to ensure they can interact with spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly, highlighting the need for evaluation of technical factors in agent development.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics assays are rapidly increasing in scale and complexity, making computational analysis a major bottleneck in biological discovery. Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world spatial datasets. We introduce SpatialBench, a benchmark of 146 verifiable problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows spanning five spatial technologies and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on frontier models shows that base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families), with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design has a large empirical effect on performance, indicating that tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment should be evaluated and improved as first-class objects. SpatialBench serves both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can interact with real spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly.

### [17] [Pruning as a Game: Equilibrium-Driven Sparsification of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22106)
*Zubair Shah,Noaman Khan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pruning is framed as a strategic game where model components compete, leading to sparsity as an equilibrium outcome; a new algorithm achieves competitive performance without explicit importance scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods rely on heuristic importance scores or regularization, missing a theoretical foundation; a game-theoretic approach offers a principled explanation for sparsity.

Method: Model parameters as players in a continuous non-cooperative game, where participation levels are optimized to balance contribution and redundancy; derive an equilibrium-driven algorithm that jointly updates parameters and participation.

Result: The approach achieves competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs on standard benchmarks, demonstrating sparsity emerges naturally from game equilibrium without external constraints.

Conclusion: Pruning can be understood as an equilibrium phenomenon, providing an interpretable, theory-grounded alternative to heuristics, with potential for broader application in model optimization.

Abstract: Neural network pruning is widely used to reduce model size and computational cost. Yet, most existing methods treat sparsity as an externally imposed constraint, enforced through heuristic importance scores or training-time regularization. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different perspective: pruning as an equilibrium outcome of strategic interaction among model components. We model parameter groups such as weights, neurons, or filters as players in a continuous non-cooperative game, where each player selects its level of participation in the network to balance contribution against redundancy and competition. Within this formulation, sparsity emerges naturally when continued participation becomes a dominated strategy at equilibrium. We analyze the resulting game and show that dominated players collapse to zero participation under mild conditions, providing a principled explanation for pruning behavior. Building on this insight, we derive a simple equilibrium-driven pruning algorithm that jointly updates network parameters and participation variables without relying on explicit importance scores. This work focuses on establishing a principled formulation and empirical validation of pruning as an equilibrium phenomenon, rather than exhaustive architectural or large-scale benchmarking. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs while offering an interpretable, theory-grounded alternative to existing pruning methods.

Conclusion: This work advances physics-informed machine learning for quantum eigenproblems by demonstrating effective handling of complex band structures and topology changes, with transfer learning capabilities.

Abstract: This thesis presents a physics-informed machine learning framework for solving the Floquet-Bloch eigenvalue problem associated with particles in two-dimensional periodic potentials, with a focus on honeycomb lattice geometry, due to its distinctive band topology featuring Dirac points and its relevance to materials such as graphene. By leveraging neural networks to learn complex Bloch functions and their associated eigenvalues (energies) simultaneously, we develop a mesh-free solver enforcing the governing Schrödinger equation, Bloch periodicity, and normalization constraints through a composite loss function without supervision. The model is trained over the Brillouin zone to recover band structures and Bloch modes, with numerical validation against traditional plane-wave expansion methods. We further explore transfer learning techniques to adapt the solver from nearly-free electron potentials to strongly varying potentials, demonstrating its ability to capture changes in band structure topology.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLSyn frames synthetic data generation as a reinforcement learning problem, stabilizing training and surpassing GANs and diffusion models in data-scarce biomedical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data generation aids biomedical data sharing but faces challenges with small datasets; current models need large data and complex training.

Method: Introduces RLSyn, a framework modeling data generation as a stochastic policy with Proximal Policy Optimization and discriminator-derived rewards.

Result: RLSyn matches diffusion models and beats GANs on MIMIC-IV, and outperforms both on AI-READI, showing robust privacy, utility, and fidelity.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning offers an effective alternative for synthetic biomedical data generation, especially in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation (SDG) is a promising approach for enabling data sharing in biomedical studies while preserving patient privacy. Yet, state-of-the-art generative models often require large datasets and complex training procedures, limiting their applicability in small-sample settings. In this work, we reframe SDG as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and introduce RLSyn, a novel framework that models the data generator as a stochastic policy over patient records and optimizes it using Proximal Policy Optimization with discriminator-derived rewards, yielding more stable and data-efficient training. We evaluate RLSyn on two biomedical datasets - AI-READI and MIMIC-IV- and benchmark it against state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion-based methods across extensive privacy, utility, and fidelity evaluations. RL-Syn performs comparably to diffusion models and outperforms GANs on MIMIC-IV, while outperforming both diffusion models and GANs on the smaller AI-READI dataset. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning provides a principled and effective alternative for synthetic biomedical data generation, particularly in data-scarce regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surveys either focus on classical AoI formulations or broadly discuss RL in wireless networks without addressing freshness as a unified learning problem.

Method: Organizes AoI into families (native, function-based, application-oriented) and introduces a policy-centric taxonomy for RL-driven freshness optimization.

Result: Provides a coherent framework for understanding how RL supports sampling, scheduling, trajectory planning, medium access, and distributed coordination.

Conclusion: This survey establishes a unified foundation for RL-driven AoI optimization in B5G/6G networks by introducing a policy-centric taxonomy and highlighting key future challenges.

Abstract: The age of information (AoI) has become a central measure of data freshness in modern wireless systems, yet existing surveys either focus on classical AoI formulations or provide broad discussions of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks without addressing freshness as a unified learning problem. Motivated by this gap, this survey examines RL specifically through the lens of AoI and generalized freshness optimization. We organize AoI and its variants into native, function-based, and application-oriented families, providing a clearer view of how freshness should be modeled in B5G and 6G systems. Building on this foundation, we introduce a policy-centric taxonomy that reflects the decisions most relevant to freshness, consisting of update-control RL, medium-access RL, risk-sensitive RL, and multi-agent RL. This structure provides a coherent framework for understanding how learning can support sampling, scheduling, trajectory planning, medium access, and distributed coordination. We further synthesize recent progress in RL-driven freshness control and highlight open challenges related to delayed decision processes, stochastic variability, and cross-layer design. The goal is to establish a unified foundation for learning-based freshness optimization in next-generation wireless networks.

TL;DR: DeepCQ is a deep-surrogate framework for lossy compression quality prediction that generalizes across compressors, metrics, and datasets, achieving high accuracy and reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computationally expensive nature of assessing data quality post-compression, given the ever-increasing volume of scientific data generated by simulations and instruments.

Method: DeepCQ uses a two-stage design that decouples computationally expensive feature extraction from lightweight metrics prediction, and employs a mixture-of-experts design optimized for time-evolving data.

Result: The framework demonstrates exceptional predictive accuracy with prediction errors generally under 10% across most settings, significantly outperforming existing methods in validation on four real-world scientific applications.

Conclusion: The framework empowers scientific users to make informed decisions about data compression based on their preferred data quality, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in scientific data analysis.

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression techniques have become vital for scientific data management and analytics, given the ever-increasing volume of data generated by modern scientific simulations and instruments. Nevertheless, assessing data quality post-compression remains computationally expensive due to the intensive nature of metric calculations. In this work, we present a general-purpose deep-surrogate framework for lossy compression quality prediction (DeepCQ), with the following key contributions: 1) We develop a surrogate model for compression quality prediction that is generalizable to different error-bounded lossy compressors, quality metrics, and input datasets; 2) We adopt a novel two-stage design that decouples the computationally expensive feature-extraction stage from the light-weight metrics prediction, enabling efficient training and modular inference; 3) We optimize the model performance on time-evolving data using a mixture-of-experts design. Such a design enhances the robustness when predicting across simulation timesteps, especially when the training and test data exhibit significant variation. We validate the effectiveness of DeepCQ on four real-world scientific applications. Our results highlight the framework's exceptional predictive accuracy, with prediction errors generally under 10\% across most settings, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our framework empowers scientific users to make informed decisions about data compression based on their preferred data quality, thereby significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in scientific data analysis.

*Shirui Chen,Jiantao Jiao,Lillian J. Ratliff,Banghua Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: dUltra is an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that uses Group Relative Policy Optimization to train a masked diffusion language model with an unmasking planner for efficient parallel token generation, improving accuracy-efficiency trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current masked diffusion language models have limited sampling speeds, making them comparable to autoregressive methods, while existing distillation-based accelerators face off-policy issues and rely on base model quality, necessitating a better approach.

Method: Proposes dUltra with an unmasking planner head predicting per-token unmasking likelihoods under Bernoulli distributions, applying GRPO to jointly optimize the base diffusion LLM and planner using verifiable, distillation rewards and unmasking steps.

Result: dUltra outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic and distillation baselines in mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, enhancing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and progressing toward diffusion supremacy.

Conclusion: dUltra advances parallel decoding efficiency in masked diffusion models through on-policy reinforcement learning, showing promise for surpassing autoregressive models in practical applications.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) offer the potential for parallel token generation, but most open-source MDLMs decode fewer than 5 tokens per model forward pass even with sophisticated sampling strategies. As a result, their sampling speeds are often comparable to AR + speculative decoding schemes, limiting their advantage over mainstream autoregressive approaches. Existing distillation-based accelerators (dParallel, d3LLM) finetune MDLMs on trajectories generated by a base model, which can become off-policy during finetuning and restrict performance to the quality of the base model's samples. We propose \texttt{dUltra}, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that learns unmasking strategies for efficient parallel decoding. dUltra introduces an unmasking planner head that predicts per-token unmasking likelihoods under independent Bernoulli distributions. We jointly optimize the base diffusion LLM and the unmasking order planner using reward signals combining verifiable reward, distillation reward, and the number of unmasking steps. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, dUltra improves the accuracy--efficiency trade-off over state-of-the-art heuristic and distillation baselines, moving towards achieving ``diffusion supremacy'' over autoregressive models.

*Yongyi Yang,Liu Ziyin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: General equivariance framework extends symmetry analyses to second-order Hessian constraints, unifying conservation laws and implicit bias, with applications to loss landscape geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symmetry analyses in deep learning are problem-specific and primarily focus on first-order consequences (conservation laws), leaving second-order structure implications less understood. There is a need for a general framework that can provide coupled first- and second-order constraints.

Method: Develops a general equivariance toolbox for analyzing learning dynamics, extending classical Noether-type analyses from gradient constraints to Hessian constraints, from symmetry to general equivariance, and from continuous to discrete transformations.

Result: The framework unifies conservation laws and implicit-bias relations as special cases of a single identity at first order. At second order, it provides structural predictions about curvature, including flat/sharp directions, gradient-Hessian alignment, and how loss landscape geometry reflects transformation structure. Applications recover known results while deriving new characterizations connecting transformation structure to optimization geometry.

Conclusion: The paper develops a comprehensive equivariance framework that extends classical symmetry analyses to encompass both first-order and second-order constraints in deep learning. It provides a unified perspective on conservation laws and implicit bias, while offering new insights into loss landscape geometry through Hessian constraints.

Abstract: Many theoretical results in deep learning can be traced to symmetry or equivariance of neural networks under parameter transformations. However, existing analyses are typically problem-specific and focus on first-order consequences such as conservation laws, while the implications for second-order structure remain less understood. We develop a general equivariance toolbox that yields coupled first- and second-order constraints on learning dynamics. The framework extends classical Noether-type analyses in three directions: from gradient constraints to Hessian constraints, from symmetry to general equivariance, and from continuous to discrete transformations. At the first order, our framework unifies conservation laws and implicit-bias relations as special cases of a single identity. At the second order, it provides structural predictions about curvature: which directions are flat or sharp, how the gradient aligns with Hessian eigenspaces, and how the loss landscape geometry reflects the underlying transformation structure. We illustrate the framework through several applications, recovering known results while also deriving new characterizations that connect transformation structure to modern empirical observations about optimization geometry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares deep learning models (LSTM, Seq2Seq, Transformer) with traditional SARIMA for estimating excess substance overdose mortality in the US during COVID-19, finding LSTM superior in accuracy and uncertainty calibration under regime change, while attention-based models overfit, with an open-source framework for public health deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance overdose mortality (over 80,000 deaths in 2023) by estimating excess mortality beyond pre-pandemic patterns, requiring methods that handle structural disruptions better than traditional linear and stationary assumptions in statistics.

Method: Systematically compare SARIMA against three deep learning architectures (LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer) using national CDC data from 2015-2019 for training/validation and 2020-2023 for projection, incorporating conformal prediction intervals and convergence analysis across 60+ trials per configuration in a reproducible pipeline.

Result: LSTM achieves superior point estimation (17.08% MAPE vs. 23.88% for SARIMA) and better-calibrated uncertainty (68.8% vs. 47.9% prediction interval coverage) under regime change, while attention-based models (Seq2Seq, Transformer) underperform due to overfitting to historical means rather than capturing emergent trends.

Conclusion: Carefully validated deep learning models, especially LSTM, provide more reliable counterfactual estimates than traditional methods for public health planning, but calibration techniques are essential when deploying neural forecasting in high-stakes domains, supported by an open-source framework deployable with state health departments.

Abstract: Substance overdose mortality in the United States claimed over 80,000 lives in 2023, with the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating existing trends through healthcare disruptions and behavioral changes. Estimating excess mortality, defined as deaths beyond expected levels based on pre-pandemic patterns, is essential for understanding pandemic impacts and informing intervention strategies. However, traditional statistical methods like SARIMA assume linearity, stationarity, and fixed seasonality, which may not hold under structural disruptions. We present a systematic comparison of SARIMA against three deep learning (DL) architectures (LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer) for counterfactual mortality estimation using national CDC data (2015-2019 for training/validation, 2020-2023 for projection). We contribute empirical evidence that LSTM achieves superior point estimation (17.08% MAPE vs. 23.88% for SARIMA) and better-calibrated uncertainty (68.8% vs. 47.9% prediction interval coverage) when projecting under regime change. We also demonstrate that attention-based models (Seq2Seq, Transformer) underperform due to overfitting to historical means rather than capturing emergent trends. Ourreproducible pipeline incorporates conformal prediction intervals and convergence analysis across 60+ trials per configuration, and we provide an open-source framework deployable with 15 state health departments. Our findings establish that carefully validated DL models can provide more reliable counterfactual estimates than traditional methods for public health planning, while highlighting the need for calibration techniques when deploying neural forecasting in high-stakes domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation in existing functional tensor decomposition approaches that assume tensor rank is known, which is an NP-hard problem to determine optimally, while also better understanding the expressive power of functional low-rank tensor models.

Method: The method utilizes variational inference with carefully designed multioutput Gaussian processes to model latent functions, enabling closed-form updates during inference and handling tensors with real-valued indices.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of RR-FBTC over state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed RR-FBTC method successfully enables automatic tensor rank determination while maintaining strong expressive power for modeling continuous multi-dimensional signals, as demonstrated by superior performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Functional tensor decomposition can analyze multi-dimensional data with real-valued indices, paving the path for applications in machine learning and signal processing. A limitation of existing approaches is the assumption that the tensor rank-a critical parameter governing model complexity-is known. However, determining the optimal rank is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) task and there is a limited understanding regarding the expressive power of functional low-rank tensor models for continuous signals. We propose a rank-revealing functional Bayesian tensor completion (RR-FBTC) method. Modeling the latent functions through carefully designed multioutput Gaussian processes, RR-FBTC handles tensors with real-valued indices while enabling automatic tensor rank determination during the inference process. We establish the universal approximation property of the model for continuous multi-dimensional signals, demonstrating its expressive power in a concise format. To learn this model, we employ the variational inference framework and derive an efficient algorithm with closed-form updates. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the RR-FBTC over state-of-the-art approaches.

The model converges to an average training loss of 0.38 by epoch 15, showing stable optimization. Qualitative analysis confirms the model captures circadian structure and behavioral transitions, with PCA plots revealing enhanced cluster alignment in embedding space.

Conclusion: MotionTeller is positioned as a scalable, interpretable system for transforming wearable sensor data into fluent, human-centered descriptions, opening new pathways for behavioral monitoring, clinical review, and personalized health interventions.

Abstract: As wearable sensing becomes increasingly pervasive, a key challenge remains: how can we generate natural language summaries from raw physiological signals such as actigraphy - minute-level movement data collected via accelerometers? In this work, we introduce MotionTeller, a generative framework that natively integrates minute-level wearable activity data with large language models (LLMs). MotionTeller combines a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a lightweight projection module that maps behavioral embeddings into the token space of a frozen decoder-only LLM, enabling free-text, autoregressive generation of daily behavioral summaries. We construct a novel dataset of 54383 (actigraphy, text) pairs derived from real-world NHANES recordings, and train the model using cross-entropy loss with supervision only on the language tokens. MotionTeller achieves high semantic fidelity (BERTScore-F1 = 0.924) and lexical accuracy (ROUGE-1 = 0.722), outperforming prompt-based baselines by 7 percent in ROUGE-1. The average training loss converges to 0.38 by epoch 15, indicating stable optimization. Qualitative analysis confirms that MotionTeller captures circadian structure and behavioral transitions, while PCA plots reveal enhanced cluster alignment in embedding space post-training. Together, these results position MotionTeller as a scalable, interpretable system for transforming wearable sensor data into fluent, human-centered descriptions, introducing new pathways for behavioral monitoring, clinical review, and personalized health interventions.

### [29] [Missing Pattern Tree based Decision Grouping and Ensemble for Deep Incomplete Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21510)
*Wenyuan Yang,Jie Xu,Hongqing He,Jiangzhang Gan,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeEIC is an incomplete multi-view clustering framework that addresses under-utilization of available data pairs by grouping data into decision sets based on missing patterns, clustering within sets, aggregating results with uncertainty-based weights, and distilling ensemble knowledge to individual models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing incomplete multi-view clustering methods overlook the pair under-utilization issue, where inconsistent missing patterns prevent full use of available multi-view pairs, limiting model performance.

Method: Defines a missing-pattern tree to group data into decision sets by missing patterns, clusters within each set, uses a multi-view decision ensemble with uncertainty-based weights to aggregate results, and transfers knowledge via ensemble-to-individual distillation with cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns.

Conclusion: TreeEIC effectively exploits available multi-view pairs by addressing pair under-utilization, with modules for grouping, ensembling, and distillation enhancing clustering accuracy and robustness, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Real-world multi-view data usually exhibits highly inconsistent missing patterns which challenges the effectiveness of incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). Although existing IMVC methods have made progress from both imputation-based and imputation-free routes, they have overlooked the pair under-utilization issue, i.e., inconsistent missing patterns make the incomplete but available multi-view pairs unable to be fully utilized, thereby limiting the model performance. To address this, we propose a novel missing-pattern tree based IMVC framework entitled TreeEIC. Specifically, to achieve full exploitation of available multi-view pairs, TreeEIC first defines the missing-pattern tree model to group data into multiple decision sets according to different missing patterns, and then performs multi-view clustering within each set. Furthermore, a multi-view decision ensemble module is proposed to aggregate clustering results from all decision sets, which infers uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable clustering decisions and produce robust decisions. Finally, an ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation module transfers the ensemble knowledge to view-specific clustering models, which enables ensemble and individual modules to promote each other by optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and exhibits superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns.

### [30] [Perplexity-Aware Data Scaling Law: Perplexity Landscapes Predict Performance for Continual Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21515)
*Lei Liu,Hao Zhu,Yue Shen,Zhixuan Chu,Jian Wang,Jinjie Gu,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A perplexity-aware scaling law optimizes data selection for continual pre-training by leveraging the knowledge gap inferred from model perplexity, improving efficiency and performance in domain-specific applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scaling laws in continual pre-training show diminishing returns when simply increasing data, leading to suboptimal utilization and inefficiency, requiring a method to better assess data utility.

Method: Proposes a novel data scaling law using perplexity from the pre-trained model as a proxy for the knowledge gap, enabling adaptive selection of high-utility subsets to maximize knowledge absorption and reduce redundancy.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method effectively identifies near-optimal training subsets and achieves superior performance on medical and general-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach enhances continual pre-training efficiency by intelligently scaling data based on informational perplexity, addressing limitations of traditional scaling laws and improving domain adaptation.

Abstract: Continual Pre-training (CPT) serves as a fundamental approach for adapting foundation models to domain-specific applications. Scaling laws for pre-training define a power-law relationship between dataset size and the test loss of an LLM. However, the marginal gains from simply increasing data for CPT diminish rapidly, yielding suboptimal data utilization and inefficient training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel perplexity-aware data scaling law to establish a predictive relationship between the perplexity landscape of domain-specific data and the test loss. Our approach leverages the perplexity derived from the pre-trained model on domain data as a proxy for estimating the knowledge gap, effectively quantifying the informational perplexity landscape of candidate training samples. By fitting this scaling law across diverse perplexity regimes, we enable adaptive selection of high-utility data subsets, prioritizing content that maximizes knowledge absorption while minimizing redundancy and noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently identifies near-optimal training subsets and achieves superior performance on both medical and general-domain benchmarks.

### [31] [Global-Graph Guided and Local-Graph Weighted Contrastive Learning for Unified Clustering on Incomplete and Noise Multi-View Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21516)
*Hongqing He,Jie Xu,Wenyuan Yang,Yonghua Zhu,Guoqiu Wen,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A contrastive learning framework for multi-view clustering addresses rare-paired and mis-paired issues in incomplete/noisy data using global-graph and local-graph guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view data often suffer from incompleteness or noise, leading to rare-paired samples (insufficient complementary information) and mis-paired samples (incorrect contrastive optimization), hindering effectiveness of CL-based multi-view clustering.

Method: Proposes an imputation-free framework: 1) global-graph guided contrastive learning constructs an affinity graph from all view samples to form new pairs for better complementarity; 2) local-graph weighted contrastive learning uses local neighbors to generate adaptive weights for contrasting to mitigate mis-pairing.

Result: Extensive experiments on incomplete and noisy multi-view data show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The unified global-local graph-guided contrastive learning framework effectively enhances clustering on incomplete and noisy multi-view data by overcoming rare-paired and mis-paired challenges.

Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL) plays an important role in exploring complementary information for multi-view clustering (MVC) and has attracted increasing attention. Nevertheless, real-world multi-view data suffer from data incompleteness or noise, resulting in rare-paired samples or mis-paired samples which significantly challenges the effectiveness of CL-based MVC. That is, rare-paired issue prevents MVC from extracting sufficient multi-view complementary information, and mis-paired issue causes contrastive learning to optimize the model in the wrong direction. To address these issues, we propose a unified CL-based MVC framework for enhancing clustering effectiveness on incomplete and noise multi-view data. First, to overcome the rare-paired issue, we design a global-graph guided contrastive learning, where all view samples construct a global-view affinity graph to form new sample pairs for fully exploring complementary information. Second, to mitigate the mis-paired issue, we propose a local-graph weighted contrastive learning, which leverages local neighbors to generate pair-wise weights to adaptively strength or weaken the pair-wise contrastive learning. Our method is imputation-free and can be integrated into a unified global-local graph-guided contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments on both incomplete and noise settings of multi-view data demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: Fed-α-NormEC is a differentially private federated learning framework with provable convergence and privacy guarantees under standard assumptions, supporting practical features like local updates and partial client participation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current differentially private federated learning methods rely on unrealistic assumptions (e.g., bounded gradients or heterogeneity), neglecting practical features such as multiple local updates and partial client participation, which hinders real-world application.

Method: The framework integrates local updates (full and incremental gradient steps), uses separate server and client stepsizes, and incorporates partial client participation, which is essential for deployment and privacy amplification.

Result: The theoretical convergence and differential privacy guarantees are validated through experiments on private deep learning tasks, demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: Fed-α-NormEC addresses limitations in existing methods by providing robust privacy and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions while fully supporting real-world federated learning features.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training on decentralized data. Differential privacy (DP) is crucial for FL, but current private methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions (e.g., bounded gradients or heterogeneity), hindering practical application. Existing works that relax these assumptions typically neglect practical FL features, including multiple local updates and partial client participation. We introduce Fed-$α$-NormEC, the first differentially private FL framework providing provable convergence and DP guarantees under standard assumptions while fully supporting these practical features. Fed-$α$-NormE integrates local updates (full and incremental gradient steps), separate server and client stepsizes, and, crucially, partial client participation, which is essential for real-world deployment and vital for privacy amplification. Our theoretical guarantees are corroborated by experiments on private deep learning tasks.

TL;DR: Introduces Generative Actor Critic (GAC), a framework that decouples policy evaluation into learning a generative model and policy improvement into versatile inference, enhancing offline-to-online RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome challenges in refining offline pretrained models with online experiences in conventional RL by reframing policy evaluation and improvement.

Method: Decouple sequential decision-making: policy evaluation learns p(τ, y) as a generative model; policy improvement performs versatile inference using a latent variable model with continuous latent plan vectors and novel inference strategies for exploitation and exploration.

Result: GAC shows strong offline performance and significantly enhanced offline-to-online improvement on Gym-MuJoCo and Maze2D benchmarks, even without step-wise rewards.

Conclusion: GAC provides an effective framework for RL by decoupling evaluation and improvement, improving adaptability from offline to online scenarios beyond traditional approaches.

Abstract: Conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, typically focused on estimating or maximizing expected returns, face challenges when refining offline pretrained models with online experiences. This paper introduces Generative Actor Critic (GAC), a novel framework that decouples sequential decision-making by reframing \textit{policy evaluation} as learning a generative model of the joint distribution over trajectories and returns, $p(τ, y)$, and \textit{policy improvement} as performing versatile inference on this learned model. To operationalize GAC, we introduce a specific instantiation based on a latent variable model that features continuous latent plan vectors. We develop novel inference strategies for both \textit{exploitation}, by optimizing latent plans to maximize expected returns, and \textit{exploration}, by sampling latent plans conditioned on dynamically adjusted target returns. Experiments on Gym-MuJoCo and Maze2D benchmarks demonstrate GAC's strong offline performance and significantly enhanced offline-to-online improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods, even in absence of step-wise rewards.

Abstract: Accurate identification of antiviral peptides (AVPs) is critical for accelerating novel drug development. However, current computational methods struggle to capture intricate sequence dependencies and effectively handle ambiguous, hard-to-classify samples. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Fusion, a novel two-stage deep learning framework integrating adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. Unlike traditional static feature concatenation, we construct a panoramic feature space using 10 distinct descriptors and introduce an Adaptive Gating Mechanism.This mechanism dynamically regulates the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Furthermore, to address data distribution challenges, we employ a contrastive learning strategy driven by Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) and BLOSUM62-based data augmentation, which significantly sharpens the model's decision boundaries. Experimental results on the benchmark Set 1 dataset demonstrate that AVP-Fusion achieves an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. In the second stage, leveraging transfer learning, the model enables precise subclass prediction for six viral families and eight specific viruses, even under limited sample sizes. In summary, AVP-Fusion serves as a robust and interpretable tool for high-throughput antiviral drug screening.

*Xiaobin Ren,Kaiqi Zhao,Katerina Taškova,Patricia Riddle*

TL;DR: AnchorGK is an anchor-based graph learning framework for spatio-temporal kriging that stratifies data by feature availability and uses dual-view graph learning to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatio-temporal kriging methods under-exploit sparse spatial distributions and heterogeneous feature availability in real deployments, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes AnchorGK with anchor locations for stratification, incremental representation for feature use, and dual-view graph learning to aggregate feature and location information.

Result: Extensive experiments show AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: AnchorGK effectively addresses sparsity and feature heterogeneity in spatio-temporal kriging, offering a principled and accurate inductive solution.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal kriging is a fundamental problem in sensor networks, driven by the sparsity of deployed sensors and the resulting missing observations. Although recent approaches model spatial and temporal correlations, they often under-exploit two practical characteristics of real deployments: the sparse spatial distribution of locations and the heterogeneous availability of auxiliary features across locations. To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for spatio-temporal kriging.

TL;DR: RefineBridge enhances transformer-based time series foundation models for financial forecasting using a Schrödinger Bridge framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial time series are challenging due to non-stationarity, heavy-tailed distributions, and noise; existing methods like LoRA underperform as they don't complement foundation models well.

Method: Proposes RefineBridge, a refinement module based on a tractable Schrödinger Bridge generative framework, using TSFM forecasts as a prior and ground truths as targets to learn stochastic transport maps.

Result: Improves state-of-the-art TSFM performance consistently across multiple financial benchmarks and prediction horizons.

Conclusion: RefineBridge effectively addresses limitations in adapting TSFMs to financial data, offering a robust enhancement through generative refinement.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is particularly challenging for transformer-based time series foundation models (TSFMs) due to non-stationarity, heavy-tailed distributions, and high-frequency noise present in data. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained TSFMs to downstream data domains. However, it still underperforms in financial data, as it preserves the network architecture and training objective of TSFMs rather than complementing the foundation model. To further enhance TSFMs, we propose a novel refinement module, RefineBridge, built upon a tractable Schrödinger Bridge (SB) generative framework. Given the forecasts of TSFM as generative prior and the observed ground truths as targets, RefineBridge learns context-conditioned stochastic transport maps to improve TSFM predictions, iteratively approaching the ground-truth target from even a low-quality prior. Simulations on multiple financial benchmarks demonstrate that RefineBridge consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art TSFMs across different prediction horizons.

*Xin Liu,Haoran Li,Dongbin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BCV-LR is an unsupervised framework for imitation learning from videos, achieving sample-efficient policy performance through self-supervised features and dynamics-based action prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans learn efficiently from videos, but replicating this for autonomous agents is challenging due to visual complexity, lack of action/reward signals, and limited interactions.

Method: Extracts action-related latent features via self-supervised tasks, predicts latent actions between frames using dynamics-based unsupervised objectives, then fine-tunes with online interactions for policy behavior cloning, iteratively improving.

Result: Achieves expert-level performance on some tasks with few interactions, outperforming state-of-the-art ILV baselines and RL methods in sample efficiency on 24/28 tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates videos can support extremely sample-efficient visual policy learning without expert supervision, offering a novel approach for autonomous agents.

Abstract: Humans can efficiently extract knowledge and learn skills from the videos within only a few trials and errors. However, it poses a big challenge to replicate this learning process for autonomous agents, due to the complexity of visual input, the absence of action or reward signals, and the limitations of interaction steps. In this paper, we propose a novel, unsupervised, and sample-efficient framework to achieve imitation learning from videos (ILV), named Behavior Cloning from Videos via Latent Representations (BCV-LR). BCV-LR extracts action-related latent features from high-dimensional video inputs through self-supervised tasks, and then leverages a dynamics-based unsupervised objective to predict latent actions between consecutive frames. The pre-trained latent actions are fine-tuned and efficiently aligned to the real action space online (with collected interactions) for policy behavior cloning. The cloned policy in turn enriches the agent experience for further latent action finetuning, resulting in an iterative policy improvement that is highly sample-efficient.
  We conduct extensive experiments on a set of challenging visual tasks, including both discrete control and continuous control. BCV-LR enables effective (even expert-level on some tasks) policy performance with only a few interactions, surpassing state-of-the-art ILV baselines and reinforcement learning methods (provided with environmental rewards) in terms of sample efficiency across 24/28 tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work for the first time demonstrates that videos can support extremely sample-efficient visual policy learning, without the need to access any other expert supervision.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Inverse-RPO, a general method to derive prior-based UCTs from any prior-free UCB, specifically applying it to UCB-V to create variance-aware tree policies that outperform PUCT in benchmarks with no extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While prior-based UCTs like PUCT have improved exploration in MCTS, deriving them from existing UCBs with strong theoretical guarantees has been challenging, limiting the development of principled alternatives.

Method: The authors propose Inverse-RPO, a systematic methodology that frames MCTS as a regularized policy optimization problem to derive prior-based UCTs from prior-free UCBs, applying it to UCB-V to incorporate variance estimates into tree policies.

Result: Experiments show that the new variance-aware prior-based UCTs, derived using Inverse-RPO, outperform PUCT across multiple benchmarks without additional computational overhead, and the method is implemented in an extended mctx library with minimal code changes.

Conclusion: Inverse-RPO enables the systematic creation of prior-based UCTs from other UCBs, enhancing MCTS performance, and the variance-aware variants demonstrate practical benefits, with provided code to support further research.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has profoundly influenced reinforcement learning (RL) by integrating planning and learning in tasks requiring long-horizon reasoning, exemplified by the AlphaZero family of algorithms. Central to MCTS is the search strategy, governed by a tree policy based on an upper confidence bound (UCB) applied to trees (UCT). A key factor in the success of AlphaZero is the introduction of a prior term in the UCB1-based tree policy PUCT, which improves exploration efficiency and thus accelerates training. While many alternative UCBs with stronger theoretical guarantees than UCB1 exist, extending them to prior-based UCTs has been challenging, since PUCT was derived empirically rather than from first principles. Recent work retrospectively justified PUCT by framing MCTS as a regularized policy optimization (RPO) problem. Building on this perspective, we introduce Inverse-RPO, a general methodology that systematically derives prior-based UCTs from any prior-free UCB. Applying this method to the variance-aware UCB-V, we obtain two new prior-based tree policies that incorporate variance estimates into the search. Experiments indicate that these variance-aware prior-based UCTs outperform PUCT across multiple benchmarks without incurring additional computational cost. We also provide an extension of the mctx library supporting variance-aware UCTs, showing that the required code changes are minimal and intended to facilitate further research on principled prior-based UCTs.

TL;DR: Tree-based models like XGBoost outperform deep learning methods on imbalanced clinical data, offering better robustness and scalability for emergency care settings where computational efficiency matters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency and intensive care environments require predictive models that are both accurate and computationally efficient, but clinical data in these settings are often severely imbalanced. This skewness undermines model reliability, particularly for rare but clinically crucial outcomes.

Method: Systematic evaluation of classical ML models on imbalanced tabular data from MIMIC-IV-ED and eICU datasets. Compared tree-based methods, TabNet deep learning model, and custom lightweight TabResNet. Used Bayesian hyperparameter search and assessed performance, robustness to imbalance, and computational scalability across seven clinically vital predictive tasks.

Result: Tree-based methods, particularly XGBoost, consistently achieved the most stable performance across different imbalance levels and scaled efficiently with sample size. Deep tabular models degraded more sharply under imbalance and had higher computational costs. TabResNet provided a lighter alternative to TabNet but did not surpass ensemble benchmarks.

Conclusion: In emergency and critical care settings, robustness to data imbalance and computational scalability are more important than architectural complexity. Tree-based ensemble methods, particularly XGBoost, currently offer the most practical and clinically feasible choice for practitioners in high-stakes, time-sensitive environments.

Abstract: Emergency and intensive care environments require predictive models that are both accurate and computationally efficient, yet clinical data in these settings are often severely imbalanced. Such skewness undermines model reliability, particularly for rare but clinically crucial outcomes, making robustness and scalability essential for real-world usage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the robustness and scalability of classical machine learning models on imbalanced tabular data from MIMIC-IV-ED and eICU. Class imbalance was quantified using complementary metrics, and we compared the performance of tree-based methods, the state-of-the-art TabNet deep learning model, and a custom lightweight residual network. TabResNet was designed as a computationally efficient alternative to TabNet, replacing its complex attention mechanisms with a streamlined residual architecture to maintain representational capacity for real-time clinical use. All models were optimized via a Bayesian hyperparameter search and assessed on predictive performance, robustness to increasing imbalance, and computational scalability. Our results, on seven clinically vital predictive tasks, show that tree-based methods, particularly XGBoost, consistently achieved the most stable performance across imbalance levels and scaled efficiently with sample size. Deep tabular models degraded more sharply under imbalance and incurred higher computational costs, while TabResNet provided a lighter alternative to TabNet but did not surpass ensemble benchmarks. These findings indicate that in emergency and critical care, robustness to imbalance and computational scalability could outweigh architectural complexity. Tree-based ensemble methods currently offer the most practical and clinically feasible choice, equipping practitioners with a framework for selecting models suited to high-stakes, time-sensitive environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty estimation is crucial for traffic services to assess risk, reliability, and provide warnings, but existing methods struggle with uncovering causes and capturing correlations of uncertainty.

Method: Proposes RIPCN, which uses a dynamic impedance evolution network to model uncertainty causes via road impedance, and a principal component network to forecast spatiotemporal uncertainty correlations.

Result: RIPCN outperforms existing probabilistic forecasting methods in experiments on real-world datasets, improving both uncertainty estimation and point prediction.

Conclusion: RIPCN effectively addresses key challenges in probabilistic traffic flow forecasting by combining domain knowledge with advanced learning, enhancing reliability and interpretability.

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation services such as navigation and ride-hailing. In such applications, uncertainty estimation in forecasting is important because it helps evaluate traffic risk levels, assess forecast reliability, and provide timely warnings. As a result, probabilistic traffic flow forecasting (PTFF) has gained significant attention, as it produces both point forecasts and uncertainty estimates. However, existing PTFF approaches still face two key challenges: (1) how to uncover and model the causes of traffic flow uncertainty for reliable forecasting, and (2) how to capture the spatiotemporal correlations of uncertainty for accurate prediction.
  To address these challenges, we propose RIPCN, a Road Impedance Principal Component Network that integrates domain-specific transportation theory with spatiotemporal principal component learning for PTFF. RIPCN introduces a dynamic impedance evolution network that captures directional traffic transfer patterns driven by road congestion level and flow variability, revealing the direct causes of uncertainty and enhancing both reliability and interpretability. In addition, a principal component network is designed to forecast the dominant eigenvectors of future flow covariance, enabling the model to capture spatiotemporal uncertainty correlations. This design allows for accurate and efficient uncertainty estimation while also improving point prediction performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms existing probabilistic forecasting methods.

The framework follows a two-stage process: the initial XGBoost model is built using raw data, and once selected as the final model, the dataset is cleaned by (1) removing multicollinear features, (2) identifying outliers with Isolation Forest, and (3) selecting important features using SHAP analysis. The refined dataset as model 2 is then used to retrain XGBoost, which achieves high prediction accuracy across all outputs. A graphical user interface (GUI) is also developed to support material designers. Overall, the proposed framework significantly improves the prediction accuracy and minimizes the need for extensive experimental testing in UHPC mix design.

*Shizhe He,Avanika Narayan,Ishan S. Khare,Scott W. Linderman,Christopher Ré,Dan Biderman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an information-theoretic framework to analyze compressor-predictor LM systems, showing that mutual information can predict performance and that scaling compressors is more effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compressor-predictor LM systems are widely used but lack systematic design guidance, making it hard to distinguish contributions of compression vs. prediction.

Method: Introduces a mutual information estimator to quantify compression quality independently of tasks and conducts empirical analysis across datasets and model families.

Result: Larger compressors are more accurate, token-efficient, and convey more bits per token; scaling compressors outperforms scaling predictors, reducing API costs.

Conclusion: Information-theoretic principles optimize LM systems, enabling efficient local compressors with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Agentic language model (LM) systems power modern applications like "Deep Research" and "Claude Code," and leverage multi-LM architectures to overcome context limitations. Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller "compressor" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger "predictor" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\times$ more accurate, $4.6\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover $99\%$ of frontier-LM accuracy at $26\%$ of API costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural network solvers like PINNs and Deep Galerkin Methods struggle with generalization and long-time prediction efficiency due to full space-time approximations.

Method: Incorporates Meta-Auto-Decoder (MAD) paradigm into NGM with space-time decoupling, meta-learning adaptation, and randomized sparse updates for stable time integration and rapid generalization.

Result: Achieves physically consistent, long-horizon predictions for complex parameterized evolution equations with significantly lower computational overhead, as shown in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The method performs comparatively well in accuracy, robustness, and adaptability for parametric PDEs, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: Parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling a wide range of physical and engineering systems influenced by uncertain or varying parameters. Traditional neural network-based solvers, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Deep Galerkin Methods, often face challenges in generalization and long-time prediction efficiency due to their dependence on full space-time approximations. To address these issues, we propose a novel and scalable framework that significantly enhances the Neural Galerkin Method (NGM) by incorporating the Meta-Auto-Decoder (MAD) paradigm. Our approach leverages space-time decoupling to enable more stable and efficient time integration, while meta-learning-driven adaptation allows rapid generalization to unseen parameter configurations with minimal retraining. Furthermore, randomized sparse updates effectively reduce computational costs without compromising accuracy. Together, these advancements enable our method to achieve physically consistent, long-horizon predictions for complex parameterized evolution equations with significantly lower computational overhead. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate that our methods performs comparatively well in terms of accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective explanation methods in machine learning, especially for neural networks in tabular data with high accuracy, while tackling problems of pseudo-correlation and causality in predictions.

Method: Proposes CENNET, a causal explanation method with an entropy-based explanation power index, integrating structural causal models (SCMs) with neural networks for causal insights.

Result: CENNET successfully provides causal explanations for predictions, as demonstrated through comparative experiments on synthetic and quasi-real data in classification tasks.

Conclusion: CENNET offers a robust approach to causal explanation in neural network predictors, enhancing interpretability in critical machine learning applications.

Abstract: The problem of explaining the results produced by machine learning methods continues to attract attention. Neural network (NN) models, along with gradient boosting machines, are expected to be utilized even in tabular data with high prediction accuracy. This study addresses the related issues of pseudo-correlation, causality, and combinatorial reasons for tabular data in NN predictors. We propose a causal explanation method, CENNET, and a new explanation power index using entropy for the method. CENNET provides causal explanations for predictions by NNs and uses structural causal models (SCMs) effectively combined with the NNs although SCMs are usually not used as predictive models on their own in terms of predictive accuracy. We show that CEN-NET provides such explanations through comparative experiments with existing methods on both synthetic and quasi-real data in classification tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study analyzes KL divergence estimators in RL for LLMs, showing biased gradients cause instability and unbias ones improve performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KL divergence regularization in RL for LLM training is widely used but not systematically studied, with discrepancies between objectives and implementations affecting model performance.

Method: Analyze gradient biases of various KL estimator configurations, RL fine-tune models (Qwen2.5-7B, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507) with different setups, and evaluate on in- and out-of-distribution tasks.

Result: Biased gradient estimators lead to training instability; unbiased ones yield better performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks; KL regularization stabilizes off-policy RL in asynchronous settings.

Conclusion: Careful selection of KL estimator configurations is crucial for stable and effective RL training of LLMs, with unbiased gradients enhancing generalization.

Abstract: The reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved by training them with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for explainable and privacy-preserving dataset distillation using rule regions from random forests for financial fraud detection, reducing data volume while maintaining performance and enhancing interpretability, privacy, and cross-institution collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable collaborative financial fraud detection across institutions while addressing challenges of data privacy, interpretability, and auditability, without exposing sensitive original records.

Method: Convert a trained random forest into transparent, axis-aligned rule regions (leaf hyperrectangles), generate synthetic transactions by uniform sampling within each region, and produce a compact surrogate dataset that preserves feature interactions and supports explainability through rule statistics and per-case rationales with uncertainty calibration.

Result: Distilled datasets reduce data volume by 85% to 93%, maintain competitive precision and F1 scores in fraud detection with a modest AUC drop, improve cross-cluster performance via shared synthesized data, achieve high structural similarity (>93%) and low memorization risk (membership-inference attacks at chance level), and enhance AUC (up to 0.687) by removing high-uncertainty points.

Conclusion: The tree-region distillation framework enables trustworthy and deployable fraud analytics with interpretable global rules, per-case rationales, quantified uncertainty, and strong privacy properties, making it suitable for multi-institution settings and regulatory audits.

Abstract: We propose an explainable, privacy-preserving dataset distillation framework for collaborative financial fraud detection. A trained random forest is converted into transparent, axis-aligned rule regions (leaf hyperrectangles), and synthetic transactions are generated by uniformly sampling within each region. This produces a compact, auditable surrogate dataset that preserves local feature interactions without exposing sensitive original records. The rule regions also support explainability: aggregated rule statistics (for example, support and lift) describe global patterns, while assigning each case to its generating region gives concise human-readable rationales and calibrated uncertainty based on tree-vote disagreement.
  On the IEEE-CIS fraud dataset (590k transactions across three institution-like clusters), distilled datasets reduce data volume by 85% to 93% (often under 15% of the original) while maintaining competitive precision and micro-F1, with only a modest AUC drop. Sharing and augmenting with synthesized data across institutions improves cross-cluster precision, recall, and AUC. Real vs. synthesized structure remains highly similar (over 93% by nearest-neighbor cosine analysis). Membership-inference attacks perform at chance level (about 0.50) when distinguishing training from hold-out records, suggesting low memorization risk. Removing high-uncertainty synthetic points using disagreement scores further boosts AUC (up to 0.687) and improves calibration. Sensitivity tests show weak dependence on the distillation ratio (AUC about 0.641 to 0.645 from 6% to 60%).
  Overall, tree-region distillation enables trustworthy, deployable fraud analytics with interpretable global rules, per-case rationales with quantified uncertainty, and strong privacy properties suitable for multi-institution settings and regulatory audit.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Causal-HM is a multimodal unsupervised anomaly detection framework for robotic welding that models physical Process→Result dependency using sensor-guided modulation and a causal-hierarchical architecture, achieving SOTA 90.7% I-AUROC on the new Weld-4M benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from causal blindness by treating process and result modalities equally, ignoring physical generative logic, and the heterogeneity gap drowns critical process context.

Method: Incorporates Sensor-Guided CHM Modulation to use low-dimensional sensor signals as context for high-dimensional audiovisual feature extraction, and a Causal-Hierarchical Architecture enforcing unidirectional generative mapping to detect anomalies violating physical consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on the new Weld-4M benchmark across four modalities show Causal-HM achieves state-of-the-art 90.7% I-AUROC.

Conclusion: Causal-HM effectively addresses limitations in multimodal UAD by modeling physical dependencies, with promising results for smart manufacturing applications like robotic welding, and code will be released.

Abstract: Multimodal Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) is critical for quality assurance in smart manufacturing, particularly in complex processes like robotic welding. However, existing methods often suffer from causal blindness, treating process modalities (e.g., real-time video, audio, and sensors) and result modalities (e.g., post-weld images) as equal feature sources, thereby ignoring the inherent physical generative logic. Furthermore, the heterogeneity gap between high-dimensional visual data and low-dimensional sensor signals frequently leads to critical process context being drowned out. In this paper, we propose Causal-HM, a unified multimodal UAD framework that explicitly models the physical Process to Result dependency. Specifically, our framework incorporates two key innovations: a Sensor-Guided CHM Modulation mechanism that utilizes low-dimensional sensor signals as context to guide high-dimensional audio-visual feature extraction , and a Causal-Hierarchical Architecture that enforces a unidirectional generative mapping to identify anomalies that violate physical consistency. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed Weld-4M benchmark across four modalities demonstrate that Causal-HM achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) I-AUROC of 90.7%. Code will be released after the paper is accepted.

*Dung Anh Hoang,Cuong Pham,Cuong Nguyen,Trung le,Jianfei Cai,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a data-aware post-training quantization method for 1-bit LLMs that addresses activation error accumulation, outperforming existing methods with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1-bit quantization of LLMs is challenging as existing methods cause significant performance drop; output-matching approaches, though intuitive, degrade performance under certain conditions.

Method: Investigates why output-matching fails in 1-bit quantization, then designs a novel PTQ approach that accounts for activation error accumulation while keeping optimization efficient.

Result: Empirical experiments show the method consistently outperforms existing 1-bit PTQ techniques, maintaining performance with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively mitigates performance loss in 1-bit LLM quantization by addressing key limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, but their massive sizes hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. To reduce their computational and memory burden, various compression techniques have been proposed, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Among these, post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted for its efficiency, as it requires no retraining and only a small dataset for calibration, enabling low-cost deployment. Recent advances for post-training quantization have demonstrated that even sub-4-bit methods can maintain most of the original model performance. However, 1-bit quantization that converts floating-point weights to \(\pm\)1, remains particularly challenging, as existing 1-bit PTQ methods often suffer from significant performance degradation compared to the full-precision models. Specifically, most of existing 1-bit PTQ approaches focus on weight alignment, aligning the full-precision model weights with those of the quantized models, rather than directly aligning their outputs. Although the output-matching approach objective is more intuitive and aligns with the quantization goal, naively applying it in 1-bit LLMs often leads to notable performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate why and under what conditions output-matching fails, in the context of 1-bit LLM quantization. Based on our findings, we propose a novel data-aware PTQ approach for 1-bit LLMs that explicitly accounts for activation error accumulation while keeping optimization efficient. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our solution consistently outperforms existing 1-bit PTQ methods with minimal overhead.

TL;DR: MMCTOP is a multimodal framework that integrates heterogeneous biomedical signals for clinical-trial outcome prediction, achieving improved performance over baselines through schema-guided textualization, modality-aware representation learning, and a drug-disease-conditioned sparse Mixture-of-Experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of multimodal data fusion in high-dimensional biomedical informatics, as clinical-trial outcomes require integration of diverse biomedical signals like molecular structure, protocol metadata, eligibility narratives, and disease ontologies.

Method: The method involves schema-guided textualization and input-fidelity validation with modality-aware representation learning, using domain-specific encoders to generate aligned embeddings, fused by a transformer backbone enhanced with a drug-disease-conditioned sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) for specialization and scalable computation via top-k routing.

Result: MMCTOP consistently improves precision, F1, and AUC compared to unimodal and multimodal baselines on benchmark datasets, and ablation studies show contributions from schema-guided textualization and selective expert routing, with temperature scaling applied for calibrated probabilities.

Conclusion: Overall, MMCTOP advances multimodal trial modeling by combining controlled narrative normalization, context-conditioned expert fusion, and operational safeguards for auditability and reproducibility.

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of multimodal data fusion in high-dimensional biomedical informatics, we propose MMCTOP, a MultiModal Clinical-Trial Outcome Prediction framework that integrates heterogeneous biomedical signals spanning (i) molecular structure representations, (ii) protocol metadata and long-form eligibility narratives, and (iii) disease ontologies. MMCTOP couples schema-guided textualization and input-fidelity validation with modality-aware representation learning, in which domain-specific encoders generate aligned embeddings that are fused by a transformer backbone augmented with a drug-disease-conditioned sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE). This design explicitly supports specialization across therapeutic and design subspaces while maintaining scalable computation through top-k routing. MMCTOP achieves consistent improvements in precision, F1, and AUC over unimodal and multimodal baselines on benchmark datasets, and ablations show that schema-guided textualization and selective expert routing contribute materially to performance and stability. We additionally apply temperature scaling to obtain calibrated probabilities, ensuring reliable risk estimation for downstream decision support. Overall, MMCTOP advances multimodal trial modeling by combining controlled narrative normalization, context-conditioned expert fusion, and operational safeguards aimed at auditability and reproducibility in biomedical informatics.

TL;DR: DT-GAN is a model-based adversarial framework using sparse synthesis and linear operators to improve GAN stability and interpretability, with theoretical guarantees on equilibrium, identifiability, and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical GANs suffer from ill-posed objectives, unstable training, and limited interpretability, motivating a structured, theoretically grounded alternative.

Method: DT-GAN uses a generator as a sparse synthesis dictionary and a discriminator as an analysis transform (energy model), with both restricted to linear operators with constraints.

Result: The adversarial game has at least one Nash equilibrium; equilibrium solutions are identifiable with geometric alignment between synthesis and analysis operators. Empirical equilibria show finite-sample stability and consistency. Experiments on synthetic data show DT-GAN recovers structure and performs stably where standard GANs degrade.

Conclusion: DT-GAN provides a principled adversarial learning approach for sparse data distributions, enhancing interpretability, stability, and correctness compared to neural GANs.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are widely used for distribution learning, yet their classical formulations remain theoretically fragile, with ill-posed objectives, unstable training dynamics, and limited interpretability. In this work, we introduce \emph{Dictionary-Transform Generative Adversarial Networks} (DT-GAN), a fully model-based adversarial framework in which the generator is a sparse synthesis dictionary and the discriminator is an analysis transform acting as an energy model. By restricting both players to linear operators with explicit constraints, DT-GAN departs fundamentally from neural GAN architectures and admits rigorous theoretical analysis.
  We show that the DT-GAN adversarial game is well posed and admits at least one Nash equilibrium. Under a sparse generative model, equilibrium solutions are provably identifiable up to standard permutation and sign ambiguities and exhibit a precise geometric alignment between synthesis and analysis operators. We further establish finite-sample stability and consistency of empirical equilibria, demonstrating that DT-GAN training converges reliably under standard sampling assumptions and remains robust in heavy-tailed regimes.
  Experiments on mixture-structured synthetic data validate the theoretical predictions, showing that DT-GAN consistently recovers underlying structure and exhibits stable behavior under identical optimization budgets where a standard GAN degrades. DT-GAN is not proposed as a universal replacement for neural GANs, but as a principled adversarial alternative for data distributions that admit sparse synthesis structure. The results demonstrate that adversarial learning can be made interpretable, stable, and provably correct when grounded in classical sparse modeling.

*Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Developing robust policy alignment for LLMs with unknown link functions between preferences and rewards, using semiparametric single-index models and practical optimization methods that avoid reward misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods assume a known link function (e.g., logistic in Bradley-Terry models) between observed preferences and unobserved rewards, but if this link is wrong, inferred rewards become biased and policies misaligned.

Method: The authors develop policy learners based on profiling the link function, orthogonalizing the link function, and link-agnostic bipartite ranking objectives. They use first-order optimization suitable for neural networks and batched data, focusing on policy learning rather than reward estimation.

Result: The proposed methods provide finite-sample policy error bounds that depend on generic functional complexity measures of the index class, and preserve direct optimization of policies without explicitly fitting rewards while being robust to unknown preference noise.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that under an unknown and unrestricted link function, realizability of the solution in a policy class implies a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, and develops practical policy learners with finite-sample error bounds that are robust to unknown preference noise distribution and scale.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to preference data is commonly implemented by assuming a known link function between the distribution of observed preferences and the unobserved rewards (e.g., a logistic link as in Bradley-Terry). If the link is wrong, however, inferred rewards can be biased and policies be misaligned. We study policy alignment to preferences under an unknown and unrestricted link. We consider an $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization problem and show that realizability of the solution in a policy class implies a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, where a scalar-valued index determined by a policy captures the dependence on demonstrations and the rest of the preference distribution is an unrestricted function thereof. Rather than focus on estimation of identifiable finite-dimensional structural parameters in the index as in econometrics, we focus on policy learning, focusing on error to the optimal policy and allowing unidentifiable and nonparametric indices. We develop a variety of policy learners based on profiling the link function, orthogonalizing the link function, and using link-agnostic bipartite ranking objectives. We analyze these and provide finite-sample policy error bounds that depend on generic functional complexity measures of the index class. We further consider practical implementations using first-order optimization suited to neural networks and batched data. The resulting methods are robust to unknown preference noise distribution and scale, while preserving the direct optimization of policies without explicitly fitting rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of continual learning lacks a unified framework, leading to fragmented research with inconsistent implementations and evaluation protocols, making fair comparisons and reproducibility difficult.

Method: LibContinual is built with a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular architecture, integrating 19 algorithms into 5 categories. It introduces strict online CL settings, a unified memory budget protocol, and a category-randomized setting to challenge implicit evaluation assumptions.

Result: Many representative continual learning methods show significant performance drops under real-world constraints, highlighting limitations in current approaches.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for resource-aware and semantically robust continual learning strategies and offers LibContinual as a foundational toolkit for advancing realistic continual learning research.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in Continual Learning (CL) is catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to new tasks degrades the performance on previous ones. While the field has evolved with diverse methods, this rapid surge in diverse methodologies has culminated in a fragmented research landscape. The lack of a unified framework, including inconsistent implementations, conflicting dependencies, and varying evaluation protocols, makes fair comparison and reproducible research increasingly difficult. To address this challenge, we propose LibContinual, a comprehensive and reproducible library designed to serve as a foundational platform for realistic CL. Built upon a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular architecture, LibContinual integrates 19 representative algorithms across five major methodological categories, providing a standardized execution environment. Meanwhile, leveraging this unified framework, we systematically identify and investigate three implicit assumptions prevalent in mainstream evaluation: (1) offline data accessibility, (2) unregulated memory resources, and (3) intra-task semantic homogeneity. We argue that these assumptions often overestimate the real-world applicability of CL methods. Through our comprehensive analysis using strict online CL settings, a novel unified memory budget protocol, and a proposed category-randomized setting, we reveal significant performance drops in many representative CL methods when subjected to these real-world constraints. Our study underscores the necessity of resource-aware and semantically robust CL strategies, and offers LibContinual as a foundational toolkit for future research in realistic continual learning.

Motivation: To investigate whether generative models can replace one step of the drug discovery pipeline - hit-like molecule generation - which is traditionally resource-intensive through high-throughput screening.

Method: Used autoregressive and diffusion-based generative models benchmarked across various datasets and training settings, with a proposed multi-stage filtering evaluation framework integrating physicochemical, structural, and bioactivity-related criteria.

Conclusion: Current generative models can generate valid, diverse, and biologically relevant compounds across multiple targets, with synthesized GSK-3β hits confirmed active in vitro, but key limitations exist in both evaluation metrics and available training data.

Abstract: Hit identification is a critical yet resource-intensive step in the drug discovery pipeline, traditionally relying on high-throughput screening of large compound libraries. Despite advancements in virtual screening, these methods remain time-consuming and costly. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled the development of generative models capable of learning complex molecular representations and generating novel compounds de novo. However, using ML to replace the entire drug-discovery pipeline is highly challenging. In this work, we rather investigate whether generative models can replace one step of the pipeline: hit-like molecule generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly frame hit-like molecule generation as a standalone task and empirically test whether generative models can directly support this stage of the drug discovery pipeline. Specifically, we investigate if such models can be trained to generate hit-like molecules, enabling direct incorporation into, or even substitution of, traditional hit identification workflows. We propose an evaluation framework tailored to this task, integrating physicochemical, structural, and bioactivity-related criteria within a multi-stage filtering pipeline that defines the hit-like chemical space. Two autoregressive and one diffusion-based generative models were benchmarked across various datasets and training settings, with outputs assessed using standard metrics and target-specific docking scores. Our results show that these models can generate valid, diverse, and biologically relevant compounds across multiple targets, with a few selected GSK-3$β$ hits synthesized and confirmed active in vitro. We also identify key limitations in current evaluation metrics and available training data.

*Hengyi Wu,Zhenyi Wang,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An entropy-aware method that adapts layer behavior in continual learning to reduce catastrophic forgetting by balancing underfitting and overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning methods often treat layers uniformly, leading to imbalanced plasticity and stability. Layers vary in uncertainty, causing high-entropy layers to underfit and low-entropy ones to overfit, which impairs performance and generalization.

Method: A dynamic feedback mechanism is used to regulate each layer's entropy: reducing entropy in high-entropy layers to combat underfitting and increasing it in low-entropy layers to prevent overfitting, promoting convergence to wider local minima.

Result: Experiments on various datasets show significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art continual learning baselines, integrating effectively with both replay- and regularization-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed entropy-aware method successfully adapts layer-specific behavior in continual learning, balancing underfitting and overfitting to enhance generalization and reduce forgetting.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to acquire new tasks while preserving performance on previously learned ones, but most methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting. Existing approaches typically treat all layers uniformly, often trading stability for plasticity or vice versa. However, different layers naturally exhibit varying levels of uncertainty (entropy) when classifying tasks. High-entropy layers tend to underfit by failing to capture task-specific patterns, while low-entropy layers risk overfitting by becoming overly confident and specialized. To address this imbalance, we propose an entropy-aware continual learning method that employs a dynamic feedback mechanism to regulate each layer based on its entropy. Specifically, our approach reduces entropy in high-entropy layers to mitigate underfitting and increases entropy in overly confident layers to alleviate overfitting. This adaptive regulation encourages the model to converge to wider local minima, which have been shown to improve generalization. Our method is general and can be seamlessly integrated with both replay- and regularization-based approaches. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art continual learning baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis of LLM scaling laws via transformer learning dynamics ODE, showing phase transition in generalization error decay and deriving scaling laws for key variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical underpinnings for the empirically observed scaling laws in LLMs, which predict performance improvements with increased computational resources but lack rigorous theoretical understanding.

Method: Formalizes transformer learning dynamics as an ODE system approximated to kernel behaviors, analyzes SGD training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary distributions.

Result: Derives a theoretical upper bound on excess risk showing distinct phase transition: exponential decay in initial optimization phase, then power-law decay of Θ(C^{-1/6}) in statistical phase. Also derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a unified theoretical framework that explains the scaling law phenomena in large language models through rigorous mathematical analysis of transformer training dynamics.

Abstract: The scaling law, a cornerstone of Large Language Model (LLM) development, predicts improvements in model performance with increasing computational resources. Yet, while empirically validated, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. This work formalizes the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, then approximates this process to kernel behaviors. Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.
  We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $Θ(\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$. Beyond this unified framework, our theory derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size, elucidating how each variable independently governs the upper bounds of generalization.

TL;DR: Simultaneous approximation error bounds for multivariate elementary functions and all their derivatives up to any order, using GELU neural networks, with control over network size, weights, and asymptotic behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide rigorous, simultaneous approximation error bounds for functions and their derivatives of any order using neural networks, which is crucial for ensuring stability and convergence in applications like solving differential equations or in optimization, where derivative information is important.

Method: The authors use a constructive approach, starting with building an approximation for multiplication using feedforward neural networks with GELU activation. They derive an error bound that holds simultaneously for a function and all its derivatives up to any prescribed order, valid across domains of increasing size. This result is then leveraged to obtain approximation guarantees for division and the exponential function.

Result: The main results include: (1) a constructive approximation for multiplication with simultaneous error bounds across domains of increasing size, (2) derived approximation guarantees for division and the exponential function, and (3) the global boundedness of higher-order derivatives of the approximators. Additionally, they report network size, weight magnitudes, and asymptotic behavior of the approximators.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that feedforward neural networks with GELU activation can approximate a range of elementary multivariate functions with explicit, multiscale error bounds for all derivatives up to an arbitrary order, and that the approximators exhibit controlled size, weight magnitudes, and asymptotic behavior.

Abstract: We derive an approximation error bound that holds simultaneously for a function and all its derivatives up to any prescribed order. The bounds apply to elementary functions, including multivariate polynomials, the exponential function, and the reciprocal function, and are obtained using feedforward neural networks with the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation. In addition, we report the network size, weight magnitudes, and behavior at infinity. Our analysis begins with a constructive approximation of multiplication, where we prove the simultaneous validity of error bounds over domains of increasing size for a given approximator. Leveraging this result, we obtain approximation guarantees for division and the exponential function, ensuring that all higher-order derivatives of the resulting approximators remain globally bounded.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Genomic prediction of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is challenging due to epistatic interactions and variable sequencing data quality.

Method: VAMP-Net uses a multi-path approach: Path-1 with a Set Attention Transformer for variant interactions and Path-2 with a CNN for variant call quality; a fusion module combines them for classification.

Result: The model achieves over 95% accuracy and around 97% AUC for Rifampicin and Rifabutin, outperforming baseline CNN and MLP models, while providing interpretability at genetic and technical levels.

Conclusion: The framework advances clinical genomics by offering high predictive performance with auditable interpretability, setting a paradigm for actionable resistance prediction.

Abstract: Genomic prediction of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains challenging due to complex epistatic interactions and highly variable sequencing data quality. We present a novel Interpretable Variant-Aware Multi-Path Network (VAMP-Net) that addresses both challenges through complementary machine learning pathways. Path-1 employs a Set Attention Transformer processing permutation-invariant variant sets to capture epistatic interactions between genomic loci. Path-2 utilizes a 1D Convolutional Neural Network that analyzes Variant Call Format quality metrics to learn adaptive confidence scores. A fusion module combines both pathways for final resistance classification. We conduct comparative evaluations of unmasked versus padding-masked Set Attention Blocks, and demonstrate that our multi-path architecture achieves superior performance over baseline CNN and MLP models, with accuracy exceeding 95% and AUC around 97% for Rifampicin (RIF) and Rifabutin (RFB) resistance prediction. The framework provides dual-layer interpretability: Attention Weight Analysis reveals Epistatic networks, and Integrated Gradients (IG) was applied for critical resistance loci (notably rpoB), while gradient-based feature importance from the CNN pathway uncovers drug-specific dependencies on data quality metrics. This architecture advances clinical genomics by delivering state-of-the-art predictive performance alongside auditable interpretability at two distinct levels, genetic causality of mutation sets and technical confidence of sequencing evidence, establishing a new paradigm for robust, clinically-actionable resistance prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and confidentiality in finance hinder model development and testing, necessitating a standardized framework to assess synthetic data quality.

Method: A multi-criteria framework is used to evaluate synthetic data from ARIMA-GARCH, VAEs, and TimeGAN on fidelity (MMD), temporal structure (autocorrelation, volatility clustering), and practical utility (portfolio optimization, volatility forecasting) using S&P 500 data.

Result: ARIMA-GARCH captures linear trends and volatility but not nonlinear dynamics; VAEs produce smooth trajectories that underestimate extremes; TimeGAN achieves the lowest MMD (1.84e-3 average) and the best trade-off in realism and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: The paper proposes guidelines for selecting generative models based on application needs and computational constraints, with the protocol aiming to standardize benchmarking in synthetic financial data research.

Abstract: Data scarcity and confidentiality in finance often impede model development and robust testing. This paper presents a unified multi-criteria evaluation framework for synthetic financial data and applies it to three representative generative paradigms: the statistical ARIMA-GARCH baseline, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN). Using historical S and P 500 daily data, we evaluate fidelity (Maximum Mean Discrepancy, MMD), temporal structure (autocorrelation and volatility clustering), and practical utility in downstream tasks, specifically mean-variance portfolio optimization and volatility forecasting. Empirical results indicate that ARIMA-GARCH captures linear trends and conditional volatility but fails to reproduce nonlinear dynamics; VAEs produce smooth trajectories that underestimate extreme events; and TimeGAN achieves the best trade-off between realism and temporal coherence (e.g., TimeGAN attained the lowest MMD: 1.84e-3, average over 5 seeds). Finally, we articulate practical guidelines for selecting generative models according to application needs and computational constraints. Our unified evaluation protocol and reproducible codebase aim to standardize benchmarking in synthetic financial data research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU-centric AI data centers use liquid cooling for extreme heat loads, but coolant leaks cause substantial energy loss through unplanned shutdowns and extended repair periods, necessitating proactive detection systems.

Method: A proof-of-concept smart IoT monitoring system combining LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting with Random Forest classifiers for instant detection, using MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards.

Conclusion: The research establishes feasibility for future operational deployment, showing potential to prevent about 1,500 kWh annual energy waste per 47-rack facility through proactive maintenance rather than emergency procedures.

Abstract: AI data centers which are GPU centric, have adopted liquid cooling to handle extreme heat loads, but coolant leaks result in substantial energy loss through unplanned shutdowns and extended repair periods. We present a proof-of-concept smart IoT monitoring system combining LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting with Random Forest classifiers for instant detection. Testing on synthetic data aligned with ASHRAE 2021 standards, our approach achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy at 90% probability within plus or minus 30-minute windows. Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware. The system employs MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards, forecasting leaks 2-4 hours ahead while identifying sudden events within 1 minute. For a typical 47-rack facility, this approach could prevent roughly 1,500 kWh annual energy waste through proactive maintenance rather than reactive emergency procedures. While validation remains synthetic-only, results establish feasibility for future operational deployment in sustainable data center operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GQ-VAE is a neural tokenizer that replaces BPE with variable-length discrete tokens, improving compression and language modeling, especially with smaller vocabularies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tokenizers like BPE are deterministic and not learned, while neural tokenizers often complicate model architecture. There's a need for a drop-in replacement that enhances performance without extensive changes.

Method: Propose GQ-VAE, a gated quantized variational autoencoder that learns to encode variable-length discrete tokens, pre-trained independently to serve as a tokenizer.

Result: GQ-VAE outperforms VQ-VAE in compression and language modeling, approaches BPE's performance, and with equivalent compression, improves downstream language model learning compared to BPE.

Conclusion: GQ-VAE is a promising alternative to BPE, offering better integration and potential for future enhancements in neural tokenization.

Abstract: While most frontier models still use deterministic frequency-based tokenization algorithms such as byte-pair encoding (BPE), there has been significant recent work to design learned neural tokenizers. However, these schemes generally add to underlying language model complexity and force large changes to architecture, making them hard to implement at large scales. To overcome these challenges, we propose the gated quantized variational autoencoder (GQ-VAE), a novel architecture that can be independently pre-trained to serve as a drop-in replacement for existing tokenizers. The key innovation of the architecture is to learn to encode variable-length discrete tokens. GQ-VAE improves compression and language modeling performance over a standard VQ-VAE tokenizer, and approaches the compression rate and language modeling performance of BPE. Interestingly, if we use BPE with a smaller vocabulary, such that the compression is equivalent between GQ-VAE and BPE, we find that GQ-VAE improves downstream language model learning. We conclude with a discussion of several exciting avenues for future work. Code can be found at https://github.com/Theo-Datta-115/gq-vae.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DATE is a diversity-aware tabular data generation framework using LLMs and bandit sampling to balance data diversity and quality, outperforming GAN and LLM baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tabular data is heterogeneous with diverse distributions, making it hard for generative models to universally generate high-quality diverse data.

Method: Partition heterogeneous data into diverse subsets, use LLMs with decision tree reasoning for in-context learning to generate labeled data for each subset, and apply a Multi-Armed Bandit sampling algorithm to balance diversity and quality in selection.

Result: DATE reduces error rates by 23.75% on average with 100 generated data, surpassing state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods in tabular classification and regression benchmarks, and improves DPO accuracy and LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: DATE effectively addresses limitations in tabular data generation by enhancing diversity and quality, demonstrating practical utility in improving machine learning applications through robust data synthesis.

Abstract: Tabular data generation has become increasingly essential for enabling robust machine learning applications, which require large-scale, high-quality data. Existing solutions leverage generative models to learn original data distributions. However, real-world data are naturally heterogeneous with diverse distributions, making it challenging to obtain a universally good model for diverse data generation. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Tabular data gEnerator (DATE), a framework that (i) prepares high-quality and distributionally distinct examples for in-context learning by effectively partitioning the original heterogeneous data into multiple diverse subsets; (ii) harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the diversity of the partitioned distribution with decision tree reasoning as feedback, generating high-quality labeled data for each subset. However, the massive generated data inherently involves a trade-off between diversity and quality. To integrate this issue, existing solutions greedily select the validation-best data. However, we prove that the selection in heterogeneous settings does not possess the greedy-choice property, and design a Multi-Arm Bandit-based sampling algorithm that balances the diversity and quality of generated data. Extensive experiments on tabular classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that DATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods. On average, DATE achieves a 23.75% reduction in error rate with just 100 generated data. Empirically, we demonstrate that data generated by DATE can improve the accuracy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs on the target data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the weaknesses of purely online algorithms (high interaction costs, slow adaptation) and purely offline methods (dependent on dataset quality, lack of exploration).

Method: Proposes hybrid CMAB-T framework and hybrid CUCB algorithm, leveraging offline data to guide exploration and accelerate convergence, while strategically incorporating online interactions to address data limitations.

Result: Hybrid CUCB significantly outperforms purely online approaches when high-quality offline data is available and corrects biases in offline-only methods with limited or misaligned data.

Conclusion: This hybrid approach offers consistent advantages and theoretical guarantees, providing an effective solution integrating offline and online learning.

Abstract: The problem of combinatorial multi-armed bandits with probabilistically triggered arms (CMAB-T) has been extensively studied. Prior work primarily focuses on either the online setting where an agent learns about the unknown environment through iterative interactions, or the offline setting where a policy is learned solely from logged data. However, each of these paradigms has inherent limitations: online algorithms suffer from high interaction costs and slow adaptation, while offline methods are constrained by dataset quality and lack of exploration capabilities. To address these complementary weaknesses, we propose hybrid CMAB-T, a new framework that integrates offline data with online interaction in a principled manner. Our proposed hybrid CUCB algorithm leverages offline data to guide exploration and accelerate convergence, while strategically incorporating online interactions to mitigate the insufficient coverage or distributional bias of the offline dataset. We provide theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's regret, demonstrating that hybrid CUCB significantly outperforms purely online approaches when high-quality offline data is available, and effectively corrects the bias inherent in offline-only methods when the data is limited or misaligned. Empirical results further demonstrate the consistent advantage of our algorithm.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional affinity prediction methods rely on scarce and expensive 3D structures; this work aims to develop a scalable sequence-only approach for drug and vaccine development.

Method: Uses pre-trained ESM-2 embeddings with a dual-stream hybrid architecture: 1D CNNs for local motif detection and Transformer encoders for global context, integrated via a fusion module and fully connected network for regression.

Conclusion: High-fidelity sequence embeddings can capture binding patterns without 3D structures, offering a scalable, efficient solution for high-throughput screening to accelerate therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Predicting the binding affinity between antigens and antibodies is fundamental to drug discovery and vaccine development. Traditional computational approaches often rely on experimentally determined 3D structures, which are scarce and computationally expensive to obtain. This paper introduces DuaDeep-SeqAffinity, a novel sequence-only deep learning framework that predicts affinity scores solely from their amino acid sequences using a dual-stream hybrid architecture. Our approach leverages pre-trained ESM-2 protein language model embeddings, combining 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local motif detection with Transformer encoders for global contextual representation. A subsequent fusion module integrates these multi-faceted features, which are then passed to a fully connected network for final score regression. Experimental results demonstrate that DuaDeep-SeqAffinity significantly outperforms individual architectural components and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. DuaDeep achieved a superior Pearson correlation of 0.688, an R^2 of 0.460, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.737, surpassing single-branch variants ESM-CNN and ESM-Transformer. Notably, the model achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.890, outperforming sequence-only benchmarks and even surpassing structure-sequence hybrid models. These findings prove that high-fidelity sequence embeddings can capture essential binding patterns typically reserved for structural modeling. By eliminating the reliance on 3D structures, DuaDeep-SeqAffinity provides a highly scalable and efficient solution for high-throughput screening of vast sequence libraries, significantly accelerating the therapeutic discovery pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods like CNNs and GNNs are used for rapid robustness prediction but neglect higher-order correlations in real-world systems modeled as hypergraphs, and existing Hypergraph Neural Networks lack theoretical expressive power limits.

Method: The paper introduces a hypergraph-level Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework, inspired by Graph Isomorphism Networks, to model complex higher-order correlations in hypergraphs for robustness prediction.

Result: Experimental results show the method maintains superior training and prediction efficiency, outperforms graph-based models, and significantly surpasses conventional HGNNs in tasks emphasizing topological structure representation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by achieving theoretical expressive power equivalence to the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test, enhancing robustness prediction in hypergraph systems.

Abstract: Robustness in complex systems is of significant engineering and economic importance. However, conventional attack-based a posteriori robustness assessments incur prohibitive computational overhead. Recently, deep learning methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have been widely employed as surrogates for rapid robustness prediction. Nevertheless, these methods neglect the complex higher-order correlations prevalent in real-world systems, which are naturally modeled as hypergraphs. Although Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted for hypergraph learning, their topological expressive power has not yet reached the theoretical upper bound. To address this limitation, inspired by Graph Isomorphism Networks, this paper proposes a hypergraph-level Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework. Theoretically, this approach is proven to possess an expressive power strictly equivalent to the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test and is applied to predict hypergraph robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that while maintaining superior efficiency in training and prediction, the proposed method not only outperforms existing graph-based models but also significantly surpasses conventional HGNNs in tasks that prioritize topological structure representation.

Motivation: Enhance DOA estimation accuracy and efficiency for sparse arrays by addressing perturbations in fixed-window smoothing methods.

Method: Develop VWS-CA-MUSIC and VWS-CA-rMUSIC algorithms with compressed smoothing apertures and derived compression parameter bounds.

Result: Simulations show significant performance improvements and complexity savings compared to fixed-window coarray MUSIC.

Conclusion: VWS framework effectively boosts DOA estimation for sparse arrays while preserving signal subspace integrity.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a variable window size (VWS) spatial smoothing framework that enhances coarray-based direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for sparse linear arrays. By compressing the smoothing aperture, the proposed VWS Coarray MUSIC (VWS-CA-MUSIC) and VWS Coarray root-MUSIC (VWS-CA-rMUSIC) algorithms replace part of the perturbed rank-one outer products in the smoothed coarray data with unperturbed low-rank additional terms, increasing the separation between signal and noise subspaces, while preserving the signal subspace span. We also derive the bounds that guarantees identifiability, by limiting the values that can be assumed by the compression parameter. Simulations with sparse geometries reveal significant performance improvements and complexity savings relative to the fixed-window coarray MUSIC method.

*Ronald Katende*

TL;DR: No uniform smoothness-based stability measures (like gradient Lipschitzness) work globally for ReLU networks, even in simple stable-looking cases, motivating nonsmooth-aware stability frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stability analyses often assume smoothness, but ReLU-type nonlinearities break these assumptions, raising questions about the applicability of classical stability bounds to modern learning systems like neural networks with ReLU activations.

Method: The authors isolate a minimal obstruction by providing a concrete counterexample where classical smoothness-based stability bounds fail for ReLU networks, even in empirically stable training scenarios.

Result: They demonstrate that no uniform smoothness-based stability proxy (e.g., gradient Lipschitzness or Hessian control) holds globally for ReLU networks, highlighting misleading results from smooth approximations.

Conclusion: The study identifies a minimal generalized derivative condition to restore meaningful stability statements, clarifying why smooth approximations of ReLU are inadequate and motivating the development of nonsmooth-aware stability frameworks for machine learning.

Abstract: Stability analyses of modern learning systems are frequently derived under smoothness assumptions that are violated by ReLU-type nonlinearities. In this note, we isolate a minimal obstruction by showing that no uniform smoothness-based stability proxy such as gradient Lipschitzness or Hessian control can hold globally for ReLU networks, even in simple settings where training trajectories appear empirically stable. We give a concrete counterexample demonstrating the failure of classical stability bounds and identify a minimal generalized derivative condition under which stability statements can be meaningfully restored. The result clarifies why smooth approximations of ReLU can be misleading and motivates nonsmooth-aware stability frameworks.

### [70] [Scaling Adversarial Training via Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22069)
*Youran Ye,Dejin Wang,Ajinkya Bhandare*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An efficient adversarial training method that selects critical samples for perturbation, reducing computation by up to 50% while maintaining robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PGD adversarial training is computationally heavy because it treats all training samples equally during iterative optimization, even though they contribute unequally to robustness.

Method: Introduce Selective Adversarial Training with two criteria: margin-based sampling (prioritizes samples near decision boundaries) and gradient-matching sampling (selects samples whose gradients align with batch optimization direction). Only selected samples are perturbed; others are trained cleanly with a mixed objective.

Result: On MNIST and CIFAR-10, the method achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding full PGD adversarial training while reducing adversarial computation by up to 50%.

Conclusion: Informed sample selection is sufficient for scalable adversarial robustness, making adversarial training more efficient without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) is a strong and widely used first-order adversarial attack, yet its computational cost scales poorly, as all training samples undergo identical iterative inner-loop optimization despite contributing unequally to robustness. Motivated by this inefficiency, we propose \emph{Selective Adversarial Training}, which perturbs only a subset of critical samples in each minibatch. Specifically, we introduce two principled selection criteria: (1) margin-based sampling, which prioritizes samples near the decision boundary, and (2) gradient-matching sampling, which selects samples whose gradients align with the dominant batch optimization direction. Adversarial examples are generated only for the selected subset, while the remaining samples are trained cleanly using a mixed objective. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that the proposed methods achieve robustness comparable to, or even exceeding, full PGD adversarial training, while reducing adversarial computation by up to $50\%$, demonstrating that informed sample selection is sufficient for scalable adversarial robustness.

### [71] [Explainable Multimodal Regression via Information Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22102)
*Zhaozhao Ma,Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal regression framework using Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to quantify modality contributions and interactions, improving accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal regression methods lack tools to measure individual modality contributions and their interactions, limiting interpretability in fusion strategies like early or late fusion.

Method: Proposes a novel framework grounded in PID, decomposing modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components, with Gaussianity enforced for analytical computation and a conditional independence regularizer to isolate unique information.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and interpretability on six real-world datasets, including brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, and enables informed modality selection for efficient inference.

Conclusion: The PID-based framework effectively addresses interpretability issues in multimodal regression by quantifying contributions and interactions, demonstrating superior performance and practical utility in applications like neuroimaging.

Abstract: Multimodal regression aims to predict a continuous target from heterogeneous input sources and typically relies on fusion strategies such as early or late fusion. However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference.

*Sunith Vallabhaneni,Thomas Berkane,Maimuna Majumder*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper presents 'AI Committee', a multi-agent system using LLMs to automatically validate and fix data quality issues in datasets collected from the web, improving completeness and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual collection and validation of web-sourced research data are time-consuming and error-prone, and existing LLM-powered web agents often fail to ensure data validity due to issues like hallucinations or misinterpretations.

Method: Introduces a model-agnostic multi-agent system where each agent specializes in tasks like source scrutiny, fact-checking, data remediation, and integrity validation, leveraging LLM capabilities like in-context learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and self-correction without specific training.

Result: Applied to three real-world datasets, the system generalizes across LLMs and significantly outperforms baselines, achieving up to 78.7% data completeness and up to 100% precision, with ablation studies showing each agent's contribution.

Conclusion: The AI Committee effectively automates the validation and remediation of web-sourced datasets, outperforming existing methods, and is released as an open-source tool for the research community.

Abstract: Many research areas rely on data from the web to gain insights and test their methods. However, collecting comprehensive research datasets often demands manually reviewing many web pages to identify and record relevant data points, which is labor-intensive and susceptible to error. While the emergence of large language models (LLM)-powered web agents has begun to automate parts of this process, they often struggle to ensure the validity of the data they collect. Indeed, these agents exhibit several recurring failure modes - including hallucinating or omitting values, misinterpreting page semantics, and failing to detect invalid information - which are subtle and difficult to detect and correct manually. To address this, we introduce the AI Committee, a novel model-agnostic multi-agent system that automates the process of validating and remediating web-sourced datasets. Each agent is specialized in a distinct task in the data quality assurance pipeline, from source scrutiny and fact-checking to data remediation and integrity validation. The AI Committee leverages various LLM capabilities - including in-context learning for dataset adaptation, chain-of-thought reasoning for complex semantic validation, and a self-correction loop for data remediation - all without task-specific training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by applying it to three real-world datasets, showing that it generalizes across LLMs and significantly outperforms baseline approaches, achieving data completeness up to 78.7% and precision up to 100%. We additionally conduct an ablation study demonstrating the contribution of each agent to the Committee's performance. This work is released as an open-source tool for the research community.

*Daniil Sherki,Daniil Merkulov,Alexandra Savina,Ekaterina Muravleva*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: PERELMAN is an agentic framework that automates scientific literature meta-analysis by extracting specific information from large article corpora using domain expert knowledge and coordinated agents, potentially reducing preparation time from months to minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The central motivation is to reliably transform heterogeneous article content from scientific literature into a unified, machine-readable representation to support large-scale literature reviews and meta-analyses, addressing the challenge of manual processing time and inconsistency.

Method: The method involves a structured dialogue with subject-matter experts to elicit domain knowledge (target variables, inclusion criteria, units, normalization rules), which is then reused across multiple pipeline stages to guide coordinated agents in extracting evidence from narrative text, tables, and figures.

Result: The system was evaluated by reproducing the meta-analysis of layered Li-ion cathode properties (NMC811 material), successfully demonstrating its ability to achieve consistent evidence aggregation across studies and validate implementation reproducibility.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that PERELMAN successfully demonstrated its capability to automate and accelerate literature meta-analyses, potentially reducing the preparation time from months to minutes while ensuring consistency and reproducibility in evidence extraction across heterogeneous scientific documents.

Abstract: We present PERELMAN (PipEline foR sciEntific Literature Meta-ANalysis), an agentic framework designed to extract specific information from a large corpus of scientific articles to support large-scale literature reviews and meta-analyses. Our central goal is to reliably transform heterogeneous article content into a unified, machine-readable representation. PERELMAN first elicits domain knowledge-including target variables, inclusion criteria, units, and normalization rules-through a structured dialogue with a subject-matter expert. This domain knowledge is then reused across multiple stages of the pipeline and guides coordinated agents in extracting evidence from narrative text, tables, and figures, enabling consistent aggregation across studies. In order to assess reproducibility and validate our implementation, we evaluate the system on the task of reproducing the meta-analysis of layered Li-ion cathode properties (NMC811 material). We describe our solution, which has the potential to reduce the time required to prepare meta-analyses from months to minutes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in finance like survivorship bias, signal integration, and reproducibility in AI-driven financial analysis, especially in high-stakes environments requiring transparency.

Method: Implemented MASFIN, integrating GPT-4.1-nano with structured metrics and unstructured news, using explicit bias-mitigation protocols to generate optimized weekly equity portfolios.

Result: MASFIN achieved a 7.33% cumulative return over eight weeks, outperforming S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, and Dow Jones in six of eight weeks, but with increased volatility.

Conclusion: The study shows that bias-aware generative AI frameworks like MASFIN hold promise for financial forecasting, emphasizing modular multi-agent design for practical and reproducible quantitative finance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) are transforming data-intensive domains, with finance representing a high-stakes environment where transparent and reproducible analysis of heterogeneous signals is essential. Traditional quantitative methods remain vulnerable to survivorship bias, while many AI-driven approaches struggle with signal integration, reproducibility, and computational efficiency. We introduce MASFIN, a modular multi-agent framework that integrates LLMs with structured financial metrics and unstructured news, while embedding explicit bias-mitigation protocols. The system leverages GPT-4.1-nano for reproducability and cost-efficient inference and generates weekly portfolios of 15-30 equities with allocation weights optimized for short-term performance. In an eight-week evaluation, MASFIN delivered a 7.33% cumulative return, outperforming the S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, and Dow Jones benchmarks in six of eight weeks, albeit with higher volatility. These findings demonstrate the promise of bias-aware, generative AI frameworks for financial forecasting and highlight opportunities for modular multi-agent design to advance practical, transparent, and reproducible approaches in quantitative finance.
