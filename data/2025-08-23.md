### [1] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning architecture using Graph Signal Processing as the computational backbone, encoding logical entities as graph signals processed via learnable spectral filters for improved logical consistency and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more mathematically grounded and computationally efficient neuro-symbolic reasoning system by leveraging spectral graph methods as the primary computational framework rather than peripheral components.

Method: Formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral domain, encoding logical entities as graph signals, processing via learnable spectral filters for multi-scale information propagation, and mapping to symbolic predicates for rule-based inference using graph Fourier transforms and band-selective attention.

Result: Demonstrated improvements in logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art neuro-symbolic models on benchmark reasoning datasets including ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge.

Conclusion: Graph Signal Processing provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for building robust and interpretable reasoning systems, offering significant advantages over conventional neuro-symbolic approaches.

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

### [2] [Goals and the Structure of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013)
*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A computational framework where descriptive and prescriptive aspects of world models co-emerge from goal-directed experiences, introducing telic states as goal-equivalent experience distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the traditional separation of state representation and reward function in reinforcement learning, proposing instead that these aspects interdependently emerge from agent goals.

Method: Introduces goal-directed state representation framework using telic states (classes of goal-equivalent experience distributions) and statistical divergence between policies and desirable experience features, drawing from Buddhist epistemology.

Result: Provides a parsimonious account of goal-directed learning that can unify behavioral, phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behavior.

Conclusion: The framework offers an alternative computational formulation where descriptive and prescriptive world model aspects co-emerge interdependently from goals, potentially providing a unified account across diverse substrates.

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

### [3] [Collab-REC: An LLM-based Agentic Framework for Balancing Recommendations in Tourism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15030)
*Ashmi Banerjee,Fitri Nur Aisyah,Adithi Satish,Wolfgang WÃ¶rndl,Yashar Deldjoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collab-REC is a multi-agent framework using three LLM agents and a moderator to generate diverse tourism recommendations that counteract popularity bias and surface overlooked destinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address popularity bias in tourism recommendations that leads to over-tourism and overlooks lesser-visited locales, while enhancing diversity and aligning with user constraints.

Method: Three LLM-based agents (Personalization, Popularity, Sustainability) generate city suggestions from different perspectives, then a non-LLM moderator merges and refines proposals through multi-round negotiation, penalizing spurious or repeated responses.

Result: Experiments on European city queries show improved diversity and overall relevance compared to single-agent baseline, successfully surfacing lesser-visited locales that are typically overlooked.

Conclusion: The multi-stakeholder collaborative approach effectively addresses over-tourism and better aligns with user constraints, demonstrating promise for LLM-driven recommender systems.

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

### [4] [See it. Say it. Sorted: Agentic System for Compositional Diagram Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15222)
*Hantao Zhang,Jingyang Liu,Ed Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free agentic system that combines VLM and LLMs to convert rough hand sketches into precise, editable SVG diagrams through iterative qualitative editing and selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with spatial precision and symbolic structure required for diagram generation, particularly for flowcharts that need alignment and compositional elements.

Method: Uses a Vision-Language Model (Critic) to propose qualitative edits, multiple LLMs to synthesize SVG updates with diverse strategies, and another VLM (Judge) to select the best candidate in an iterative loop.

Result: Outperforms GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on 10 paper-derived flowchart sketches, better reconstructing layout/structure and accurately composing primitives without unwanted text insertion.

Conclusion: The approach produces editable SVG programs, supports human corrections, and is extensible to presentation tools via APIs, with open-sourced implementation available.

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

### [5] [Emergent Crowds Dynamics from Language-Driven Multi-Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15047)
*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel agent-based crowd simulation method using LLMs to generate dialogue and drive navigation, creating more realistic social interactions and emergent group behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd simulations lack complex social and environmental interactions driven by language, limiting agent-agent and agent-environment interactions to basic steering and goal extrapolation.

Method: Uses LLMs with agent personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to generate inter-agent dialogue based on spatial/social relationships. Combines conversation, personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to control navigation and steering decisions.

Result: Validated in complex scenarios showing automatic grouping/ungrouping of agents and information-passing within crowds. Produces realistic simulations with emergent group behaviors from environmental settings.

Conclusion: The framework enables more realistic crowd simulations by incorporating language-driven social interactions, allowing natural emergence of group behaviors through dialogue and perceptual inputs.

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [6] [Multiple Memory Systems for Enhancing the Long-term Memory of Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15294)
*Gaoke Zhang,Bo Wang,Yunlong Ma,Dongming Zhao,Zifei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a multiple memory system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology to improve memory quality and retrieval in language model agents, outperforming existing methods like MemoryBank and A-MEM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory modules for language model agents (MemoryBank, A-MEM) have poor quality stored memory content, which negatively impacts recall performance and response quality when handling large amounts of historical interaction data.

Method: Designed a multiple memory system that processes short-term memory into multiple long-term fragments, creates retrieval memory units and contextual memory units with one-to-one correspondence, and matches relevant retrieval units during query processing to obtain corresponding contextual units for enhanced response generation.

Result: Experiments on LoCoMo dataset showed superior performance compared to three other methods. Ablation studies confirmed memory unit design rationality, and analysis demonstrated robustness regarding memory segment selection and storage overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed MMS system effectively utilizes historical data by constructing high-quality long-term memory content, demonstrating practical value and effectiveness in enhancing agent performance through better memory management.

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

### [7] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Increasing reasoning budgets in LLMs impairs confidence calibration, causing systematic overconfidence, while search-augmented generation dramatically improves accuracy to 89.3% by retrieving evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models need robust calibration to avoid overconfidence in question answering, requiring systematic evaluation of how reasoning capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy.

Method: Used ClimateX dataset expanded to human and planetary health, evaluated reasoning LLMs' confidence calibration, tested different reasoning budgets, and compared with search-augmented generation approaches.

Result: Recent reasoning LLMs achieved 48.7% accuracy in expert confidence assessment, but increasing reasoning budgets consistently impaired calibration. Search-augmented generation achieved 89.3% accuracy by retrieving relevant evidence.

Conclusion: Information access, rather than reasoning depth or inference budget, is the critical bottleneck for improved confidence calibration in knowledge-intensive tasks, challenging the 'test-time scaling' paradigm.

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

### [8] [Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652)
*Ardian Selmonaj,Miroslav Strupl,Oleg Szehr,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICVs use information-theoretic Shapley values to quantify individual agent contributions in MARL by analyzing policy distributions, without needing explicit reward signals or value functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARL evaluation focuses on overall team performance but lacks methods to understand individual agent behaviors and contributions when value feedback is unavailable.

Method: Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs) measure causal influence on co-players' instrumental empowerment through information-theoretic Shapley values, assessing decision uncertainty and preference alignment.

Result: ICVs successfully identify beneficial agent behaviors that foster deterministic decisions or preserve flexibility, revealing cooperation dynamics across both cooperative and competitive environments.

Conclusion: The method provides novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances explainability in MARL systems by quantifying agent contributions through policy analysis alone.

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

### [10] [Language-Guided Tuning: Enhancing Numeric Optimization with Textual Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15757)
*Yuxing Lu,Yucheng Hu,Nan Sun,Xukai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LGT is a novel framework using multi-agent LLMs with natural language reasoning and textual gradients to optimize ML configurations, outperforming traditional methods while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML configuration optimization treats dimensions independently and lacks interpretability, while automated methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about optimization decisions.

Method: Language-Guided Tuning (LGT) employs three specialized LLM agents (Advisor, Evaluator, Optimizer) that use natural language reasoning and textual gradients to create a self-improving feedback loop for configuration optimization.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets shows LGT achieves substantial performance improvements over traditional optimization methods while maintaining high interpretability.

Conclusion: LGT successfully addresses the limitations of traditional configuration optimization by combining multi-agent LLM reasoning with textual gradients, providing both performance gains and interpretable optimization decisions.

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

### [11] [S3LoRA: Safe Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning in Adaptation of Agent Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15068)
*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA is a lightweight, data-free framework that improves safety in LoRA-adapted LLMs by analyzing weight updates, detecting unsafe layers via spectral sharpness metrics, and pruning them without compromising task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEFT techniques like LoRA can compromise safety alignment in LLMs, leading to unsafe behaviors in agent planning. Existing safety methods require access to base models which are often unavailable.

Method: Proposes MAS-SVD for structural analysis of LoRA updates and Spectral Sharpness Index to detect unsafe layers, which are then pruned post-hoc to reduce risks.

Result: Extensive experiments show S3LoRA consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining utility and reducing inference costs across agent planning and language tasks.

Conclusion: S3LoRA provides a practical, scalable solution for safe deployment of LLM-based agents in resource-constrained and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Workforce management as abstract argumentation enables real-time change accommodation and faithful explanations, outperforming manual solutions in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Workforce management needs to handle runtime changes and provide explanations to stakeholders, which conventional manual approaches struggle with.

Method: Model workforce management as abstract argumentation framework in an industrial application context.

Result: User study shows the tool with argumentation-based explanations leads to faster and more accurate problem solving compared to conventional manual solutions.

Conclusion: Abstract argumentation provides an effective framework for workforce management that accommodates changes and delivers faithful explanations to stakeholders.

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

*Rachel Ma,Jingyi Qu,Andreea Bobu,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GOOD is a method that uses LLMs to infer human goals from dialogue in open-ended assistance scenarios, enabling probabilistic goal tracking without large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI agents need to interpret diverse, undefined human goals in open-ended environments where goal spaces are unbounded and evolving.

Method: GOOD prompts LLMs to simulate users with complex intents, using these responses to perform probabilistic inference over natural language candidate goals during interactions.

Result: Outperforms baseline without explicit goal tracking in both grocery shopping and household robotics environments, validated by LLM-based and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach enables rich goal representations and uncertainty estimation in open-universe assistance games without requiring large offline datasets.

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

TL;DR: aiXiv is a new open-access platform that enables AI-generated research to be submitted, reviewed, and improved through multi-agent collaboration between human and AI scientists, addressing the publication gap for AI-generated content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of AI-generated research content faces barriers in traditional publication systems that rely on human peer review and are reluctant to accept AI work, while existing preprint servers lack quality control mechanisms.

Method: aiXiv uses a multi-agent architecture with API and MCP interfaces that allow seamless integration of human and AI scientists for submitting, reviewing, and iteratively refining research proposals and papers.

Result: Extensive experiments show that aiXiv significantly enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers through iterative revising and reviewing on the platform.

Conclusion: aiXiv provides a scalable and extensible ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery, laying the groundwork for next-generation open-access publishing that accelerates dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question

achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves

*Kai Xiong,Yanwei Huang,Rongjunchen Zhang,Kun Chen,Haipang Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuzzleClone is a formal framework using SMT solvers to generate scalable, verifiable mathematical/logical puzzles for LLM training, achieving significant performance improvements on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-generated datasets suffer from limited reliability, diversity, and scalability, creating a need for high-quality verifiable mathematical and logical data to strengthen reasoning capabilities.

Method: Three-step approach: (1) encode seed puzzles into structured logical specifications using SMT, (2) generate scalable variants through systematic variable and constraint randomization, (3) ensure validity via reproduction mechanism.

Result: Created benchmark with 83K+ validated puzzles. Post-training improved PuzzleClone average from 14.4% to 56.2% and achieved up to 12.5% absolute improvement on 7 logic/math benchmarks (e.g., AMC2023 from 52.5% to 65.0%).

Conclusion: PuzzleClone provides a scalable framework for generating high-quality verifiable reasoning data that significantly enhances LLM performance on mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM4Sweat is an open-source LLM framework for hyperhidrosis support that uses synthetic data generation, fine-tuning, and expert evaluation to overcome data scarcity in rare diseases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of applying LLMs to rare medical conditions like hyperhidrosis (affecting 2-3% population) where scarce and unreliable datasets hinder fine-tuning and no prior work has tailored LLMs for this condition.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Data augmentation using frontier LLM to generate medically plausible synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data, 2) Fine-tuning open-source foundation model on the dataset for diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and psychological support, 3) Inference and expert evaluation by clinical/psychological specialists with iterative dataset enrichment.

Result: LLM4Sweat outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for hyperhidrosis, providing accurate diagnosis, personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.

Conclusion: The framework offers a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with similar data scarcity and trustworthiness challenges, demonstrating successful application of LLMs to rare medical conditions through synthetic data generation and expert validation.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

### [18] [R-ConstraintBench: Evaluating LLMs on NP-Complete Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15204)
*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench evaluates LLMs on resource-constrained scheduling problems, showing models perform well on simple precedence constraints but collapse when complex constraints interact, revealing limited generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of large language models in reasoning under high-constraint regimes for scheduling problems across various sectors like manufacturing, logistics, and IT transitions.

Method: Developed R-ConstraintBench framework that incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints in DAGs, then introduces downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive constraints, evaluated through feasibility and error analysis.

Result: Strong models perform near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs but feasibility performance collapses when complex constraints interact, with constraint interaction identified as the principal bottleneck rather than graph depth.

Conclusion: LLMs have limited generalization capabilities in complex constraint environments, and performance on synthetic problems doesn't guarantee transfer to real-world domain scenarios, highlighting reliability concerns for practical applications.

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

*Wei Yang,Jinwei Xiao,Hongming Zhang,Qingyang Zhang,Yanna Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel coarse-to-fine memory framework that grounds environmental information at multiple granularities to enhance LLM-based agents' planning flexibility and adaptability to diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-granularity memory approaches in LLM-based agents are constrained by experience quality, limiting knowledge diversity and planning flexibility. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging multi-granular memory grounding.

Method: Proposes Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory framework that: 1) grounds environmental info into coarse-grained focus points for experience collection, 2) extracts actionable hybrid-grained tips from experiences, 3) retrieves relevant experiences/tips for planning, and 4) enables fine-grained self-QA reflection for plan correction during anomalies.

Result: The framework enhances LLM-based agents' ability to adapt to diverse scenarios by leveraging multi-level memory representations, improving planning flexibility and robustness to environmental changes.

Conclusion: The coarse-to-fine memory grounding approach provides a more flexible and adaptive framework for LLM-based agents, overcoming limitations of single-granularity memory systems and enabling better handling of complex planning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

### [21] [Search-Based Credit Assignment for Offline Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15327)
*Xiancheng Gao,Yufeng Shi,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPW unifies expert demonstrations and human preferences for offline RL by using similarity search to assign stepwise importance weights, enabling better credit assignment and outperforming previous methods on robot manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL typically requires well-defined reward functions that are expensive to design. Human feedback alternatives (demonstrations and preferences) have complementary limitations - demonstrations are costly and limited, while preferences lack clear credit assignment.

Method: Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) searches for similar state-action pairs from expert demonstrations for each transition in preference-labeled trajectories, then derives stepwise importance weights based on similarity scores to guide preference learning.

Result: SPW enables effective joint learning from both preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that use both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: SPW successfully unifies two forms of human feedback (demonstrations and preferences) through similarity-based weighting, solving credit assignment issues and achieving superior performance in offline reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RETAIL dataset and TGMA framework to address limitations in current travel planning systems, improving performance from 1.0% to 2.72% pass rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current travel planning systems are misaligned with real-world scenarios - they assume explicit queries, ignore environmental factors and user preferences, and only provide basic POI arrangements without rich details.

Method: Constructed RETAIL dataset supporting implicit/explicit queries with revision needs, and proposed topic-guided multi-agent framework (TGMA) for environmental awareness and detailed planning.

Result: Strongest existing model achieved only 1.0% pass rate, while TGMA demonstrated substantially improved performance at 2.72%.

Conclusion: TGMA offers promising directions for real-world travel planning by addressing key limitations of current systems through improved dataset and multi-agent framework.

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

TL;DR: DiagECG integrates ECG signals with language models by discretizing ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens, enabling LLMs to process both ECG data and natural language for clinical text generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated ECG approaches struggle with generalization across clinical tasks and lack open-ended reasoning capabilities, limiting their diagnostic utility.

Method: Discretize continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using lead-independent encoder and quantization, extend LLM vocabulary with ECG tokens, pretrain on ECG forecasting, and instruction tune for ECG QA and report generation.

Result: Achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings without modifying core model architecture.

Conclusion: Symbolic ECG representations integrated into LLMs show strong potential for medical reasoning and clinical applications, demonstrating effective modality bridging.

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overthinking in LLMs where excessively long reasoning chains cause computational waste and slower responses, by enabling adaptive reasoning depth based on task difficulty.

Method: Three-stage training pipeline: Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning to predict reasoning budget (number of blocks) and partition reasoning accordingly.

Result: Framework allows LLMs to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, enabling flexible adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

Conclusion: The Think in Blocks framework successfully enables adaptive reasoning from zero to deep reasoning, optimizing computational efficiency while maintaining performance on complex logical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

TL;DR: Study shows that combining repeated team interactions with inter-group competition in Prisoner's Dilemma games significantly increases cooperation levels in language model agents, providing a framework for designing cooperative AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate cooperative behavior in autonomous AI agents by testing super-additive cooperation theory, which suggests that repeated interactions combined with inter-group rivalry drive human cooperation tendencies.

Method: Created a virtual tournament where language model agents were grouped into teams and played Prisoner's Dilemma games, simulating both internal team dynamics and external competition between groups.

Result: The combination of repeated team interactions and inter-group competition substantially boosted both overall cooperation levels and initial one-shot cooperation tendencies in the AI agents.

Conclusion: Intergroup competition can paradoxically lead to more cooperative behavior, providing crucial insights for designing future multi-agent AI systems that align with human values and work effectively together.

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Motivation: Existing 3D reasoning approaches generate short reasoning chains due to simple dataset questions, limiting complex reasoning capabilities.

Method: Combinatorial iterative evolutionary approach to generate complex questions on SQA3D benchmark, plus DPO fine-tuning to optimize toolchain strategies.

Result: Enhanced LLM proficiency in 3D tool usage and improved accuracy in complex 3D reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the challenge of complex 3D reasoning by generating more sophisticated questions and optimizing tool usage strategies.

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

TL;DR: A framework using dynamical systems theory and Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent to analyze RL policies, identifying safety barriers and failure modes through Lagrangian Coherent Structures with quantitative safety metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning lacks formal verification methods for safety-critical systems, limiting its application in domains where robustness and safety guarantees are essential.

Method: Analyze RL agent-environment as discrete-time autonomous dynamical system using Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent to identify Lagrangian Coherent Structures, and introduce quantitative metrics (MBR, ASAS, TASAS) for safety assessment.

Result: Framework successfully identifies repelling LCS as safety barriers and attracting LCS as convergence properties/failure modes, revealing critical flaws in policies that appear successful based solely on reward metrics.

Conclusion: The approach provides comprehensive and interpretable policy assessment with formal safety measurements, extending to handle model uncertainty and offering local stability guarantees for RL systems.

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentics is a modular framework for building agent-based systems that enables structured reasoning and compositional generalization over complex data through logical transduction between data types powered by LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a framework that abstracts agents from logical flow and enables developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting prompts, offering a declarative approach to AI workflows.

Method: Uses a modular framework where agents are embedded within data types to enable logical transduction between different data types, with LLMs executing the transduction when types are connected.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in domain-specific multiple-choice question answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization tasks with improved scalability.

Conclusion: Agentics provides an effective framework for structured reasoning and compositional generalization, demonstrating practical applicability across various AI tasks while maintaining performance and scalability.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at
\texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

*Meera Ray,Christopher L. Dancy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HDM is a vector-symbolic alternative to ACT-R's Declarative Memory that maintains compatibility with existing ACT-R models while providing scalability and similarity advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable vector-symbolic alternative to ACT-R's Declarative Memory system that preserves compatibility with existing models while offering architectural advantages like similarity-based retrieval and improved scaling.

Method: Adapted HDM to work with Lisp ACT-R, developed vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, created text processing pipeline for document ingestion, and implemented novel vector-based chunk retrieval mechanism using token representations.

Result: Preliminary results show HDM maintains vector-symbolic advantages (chunk recall without storage, scaling benefits) while allowing previous ACT-R models to work with minimal modifications to procedural and declarative memory components.

Conclusion: The adapted HDM module successfully bridges traditional ACT-R models with vector-symbolic advantages, with ongoing work focusing on improved time-context representations and testing through IBL-based decision-making models.

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes EU AI Act through techno-philosophical lens, revealing how AI data lifecycles create recursive value chains that challenge Responsible AI frameworks, proposing Simondonian-inspired concepts and regulatory measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address regulatory blind spots in AI policymaking by examining the dynamic lifecycle of AI systems from data ingestion to deployment, and how this creates recursive value chains that existing Responsible AI frameworks fail to capture.

Method: Cross-disciplinary approach combining technical analysis with philosophical framework (Simondonian philosophy of technology), introducing conceptual tools to model AI pipeline including data, training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning.

Result: Development of 'futurity' concept - the self-reinforcing AI lifecycle where data enhances performance and expands applications, revealing escalating power asymmetries and concentration of value in tech oligarchies through infrastructural capture.

Conclusion: Effective AI regulation must address infrastructural and temporal dynamics through measures like lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback accountability, recursion transparency, and rights to contest recursive reuse.

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be
transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First study measuring AI serving environmental impact in production, finding Gemini Apps text prompts use 0.24Wh energy (less than 9s TV) and 0.26mL water, with Google achieving 33x energy reduction and 44x carbon reduction over one year.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI adoption accelerates, there's a critical need to understand and mitigate its environmental impact, but no previous studies have measured AI serving environmental metrics in actual production environments.

Method: Comprehensive methodology measuring energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads in large-scale production environment, accounting for full AI serving infrastructure including active AI accelerator power, host system energy, idle capacity, and data center overhead.

Result: Median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24Wh energy (substantially lower than public estimates) and 0.26mL water equivalent. Google's efficiency efforts achieved 33x energy reduction and 44x carbon footprint reduction for median text prompt over one year.

Conclusion: While AI serving impacts are relatively low compared to daily activities, comprehensive environmental measurement is critical for accurate model comparisons and incentivizing efficiency gains across the full AI serving stack.

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

*Emma Rath,Stuart Armstrong,Rebecca Gorman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using state-of-the-art language models to detect parasocial cues in AI conversations in real-time, showing promising results in identifying harmful parasocial relationships early.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parasocial relationships with AI agents can have severe negative impacts on human well-being, but preventing them is challenging because these cues emerge gradually in private conversations and not all emotional engagement is harmful.

Method: Repurposed a state-of-the-art language model to create a response evaluation framework that assesses ongoing conversations for parasocial cues. Tested with a synthetic dataset of 30 dialogues covering parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations using five-stage testing with tolerant unanimity rules.

Result: The framework successfully identified all parasocial conversations with no false positives, typically detecting harmful cues within the first few conversational exchanges.

Conclusion: Evaluation agents show promise as a viable solution for preventing parasocial relationships with AI systems, providing early detection capabilities that could mitigate harmful effects on users.

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical Safe RL framework for autonomous vehicles that integrates ethical reasoning with driving objectives, using ethical risk cost and prioritized experience replay for decision-making, combined with polynomial path planning and PID/Stanley controllers for execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles by embedding robust ethical reasoning into their decision-making processes for both routine and emergency maneuvers, addressing the need for ethically accountable autonomy in human-mixed traffic environments.

Method: Hierarchical Safe RL framework with two levels: 1) Decision level uses Safe RL agent trained with composite ethical risk cost (collision probability + harm severity) and dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay for rare high-risk events; 2) Execution level uses polynomial path planning with PID and Stanley controllers for smooth trajectory execution.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in reducing ethical risk while maintaining driving performance, validated on real-world traffic datasets with diverse vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians.

Conclusion: First study demonstrating ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via Safe RL in real-world scenarios, showing potential of combining formal control theory and data-driven learning for ethically accountable autonomy.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

TL;DR: Personalized lung cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects optimal model for each patient using cohort retrieval and LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address variability in lung cancer risk prediction across different patient populations and clinical settings where no single model performs best for all cohorts.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) FAISS-based similarity search to retrieve most relevant patient cohort from multi-institutional database, 2) LLM reasoning with retrieved cohort and performance metrics to select optimal prediction algorithm from 8 models including classical, temporal, and multi-modal approaches.

Result: Enables dynamic, cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile using CT scans and structured metadata.

Conclusion: Provides flexible, cohort-driven model selection for individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening across diverse clinical populations.

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in symptom evolution complexity and insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression prediction.

Method: Integrates graph neural networks to model structural relationships among multimodal clinical symptoms and Transformer architecture for temporal modeling. Uses structure-aware gating mechanism to fuse structural and temporal information, with multi-component pipeline including graph construction, temporal encoding, and prediction layers.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1 metrics. Effectively distinguishes progression stages and captures personalized symptom trajectories with strong generalization and structural scalability.

Conclusion: Provides reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive diseases like Parkinson's disease through effective integration of structural perception and temporal modeling.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

TL;DR: HHNAS-AM is a hierarchical hybrid neural architecture search method that uses adaptive mutation policies with Q-learning to efficiently navigate structured search spaces for text classification, achieving 8% improvement on Spider dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NAS models for text classification lack hierarchical structure and have unorganized, redundant search spaces that RL models cannot navigate effectively, leading to inefficient architecture discovery.

Method: Proposes HHNAS-AM with architectural templates based on domain-specific cues, using adaptive mutation policies with Q-learning that dynamically adjust based on performance feedback from previous iterations in a probabilistic framework.

Result: The method consistently discovers high-performing architectures and achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines on the Spider dataset for database id prediction.

Conclusion: Hierarchical organization of search spaces with adaptive mutation policies enables more effective and accelerated traversal of NAS search spaces, leading to superior architecture discovery for text classification tasks.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

TL;DR: LPO is a new preference optimization method that improves upon DPO by addressing overfitting and collapse issues through gradient decoupling, stability improvements, and controllable rejection suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO suffers from overfitting and collapse problems despite its simplicity and training stability. The authors aim to create a more robust alignment framework that maintains stability while preventing these issues.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Gradient decoupling using absolute difference loss instead of log-sigmoid, 2) Stability improvement through offset constraint with positive regularization, 3) Controllable rejection suppression with gradient separation and tunable coefficient.

Result: LPO consistently improves performance across various tasks including general text tasks, math tasks, and text-to-speech tasks, demonstrating robust and tunable preference alignment.

Conclusion: LPO establishes itself as a robust and tunable paradigm for preference alignment, with publicly released source code, models, and training data to facilitate further research.

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

TL;DR: LFM4Ads is a novel framework that transfers all representations (user, item, and cross representations) from pre-trained foundation models for ads recommendation, using multi-granularity transfer mechanisms to achieve significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods only transfer user representations and fail to utilize valuable item and cross representations, leaving performance gains untapped in online advertising recommendation systems.

Method: Proposes LFM4Ads framework that comprehensively transfers all three representation types, identifies optimal extraction layers for cross representations, and employs multi-granularity transfer including non-linear adapters, Isomorphic Interaction Module, and Standalone Retrieval.

Result: Successfully deployed at Tencent's industrial-scale platform, processing tens of billions of daily samples. Achieved 10+ production launches with 2.45% overall GMV lift across platform, translating to hundreds of millions in annual revenue increases.

Conclusion: LFM4Ads demonstrates that comprehensive representation transfer with multi-granularity mechanisms significantly outperforms existing approaches and delivers substantial business value in large-scale advertising systems.

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+

*Anurup Naskar,Nathanael Zhixin Wong,Sara Shamekh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CuMoLoS-MAE is a curriculum-guided masked autoencoder that reconstructs atmospheric profiles while quantifying uncertainty, enabling better feature restoration and supporting weather applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional atmospheric profile restoration methods blur fine-scale features and lack uncertainty estimates, while deep learning models don't provide confidence measures for their reconstructions.

Method: Uses a curriculum-guided Monte Carlo stochastic ensemble masked autoencoder with progressive mask-ratio training and Monte Carlo sampling at inference to generate multiple reconstructions and uncertainty maps.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of fine-scale atmospheric features (updrafts, downdrafts, shear lines, vortices) with pixel-wise uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The method enables enhanced convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves long-term climate reanalysis through uncertainty-aware atmospheric profile restoration.

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

### [47] [Generative Neural Operators of Log-Complexity Can Simultaneously Solve Infinitely Many Convex Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14995)
*Anastasis Kratsios,Ariel Neufeld,Philipp Schmocker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper bridges the theory-practice gap for neural operators by showing that generative equilibrium operators (GEOs) can approximate solutions to convex optimization problems with logarithmic parameter growth in error tolerance, validated on PDEs, optimal control, and finance applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a significant gap between theoretical worst-case parameter bounds for neural operators (suggesting unrealistically large models) and experimental evidence showing their practical effectiveness. This paper aims to close this gap for a specific class of neural operators.

Method: The authors use generative equilibrium operators (GEOs) with finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers to solve families of convex optimization problems over separable Hilbert spaces. The method involves approximating solutions to optimization problems defined by input loss functions.

Result: The paper demonstrates that when input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional compact sets, GEOs can uniformly approximate solutions with arbitrary precision, requiring only logarithmic growth in rank, depth, and width relative to the approximation error. The approach is validated on nonlinear PDEs, stochastic optimal control, and financial hedging problems.

Conclusion: The research successfully bridges the theory-practice divide for neural operators by providing theoretical guarantees for GEOs with realistic parameter requirements, demonstrating both theoretical soundness and practical trainability across multiple application domains.

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action spaces, where agents need to identify malicious behavior in real-time.

Method: Uses deep neural networks to approximate normal agent behavior as parametric multivariate Gaussian distributions, defines normality scores, and employs two-sided CUSUM procedure to detect deviations from normal behavior patterns.

Result: Achieves AUC-ROC scores over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks across various multi-agent PettingZoo benchmarks, outperforming discrete counterparts.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized detector effectively identifies adversarial attacks in continuous action space multi-agent systems using statistical characterization and real-time monitoring.

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

TL;DR: A system combining static compiler analysis with Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently partition large ML models across distributed accelerators, overcoming memory constraints and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auto-partitioners for ML model partitioning suffer from out-of-memory errors, slow exploration of exponential search spaces, and often produce infeasible or sub-optimal solutions due to artificial search space restrictions.

Method: Combines novel static compiler analysis that identifies tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding and partitioning conflicts, with Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently explore the decision space.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering previously unknown superior solutions with full automation.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides an effective automated solution for partitioning large ML models, overcoming memory constraints and achieving better performance than existing approaches through intelligent search space construction and exploration.

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

TL;DR: SEAL is an interpretable graph neural network that attributes molecular property predictions to meaningful chemical substructures, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and human-aligned interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks are effective for molecular property prediction but lack interpretability, limiting trust in critical applications like drug discovery. Existing explanation techniques fail to reliably quantify atom/substructure contributions due to entangled message-passing dynamics.

Method: SEAL decomposes input molecular graphs into chemically relevant fragments and estimates their causal influence on outputs. It explicitly reduces inter-fragment message passing in the model architecture to achieve strong alignment between fragment contributions and predictions.

Result: Extensive evaluations show SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user study confirms it provides more intuitive and trustworthy explanations to domain experts.

Conclusion: SEAL bridges the gap between predictive performance and interpretability, offering a promising direction for more transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

### [52] [Twin-Boot: Uncertainty-Aware Optimization via Online Two-Sample Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15019)
*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Twin-Boot is a gradient descent method that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization by training two identical models on bootstrap samples with periodic resets to keep them in the same basin, providing better calibration and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient descent lacks confidence measures, especially problematic in overparameterized/low-data regimes where models easily overfit. Bootstrapping is impractical for deep learning due to computational cost and non-convex landscape issues.

Method: Two identical models trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples with periodic mean-reset to keep trajectories in the same basin. Their divergence estimates local uncertainty, which guides adaptive weight sampling for regularization favoring flatter solutions.

Result: The approach improves calibration and generalization in deep neural networks and high-dimensional inverse problems, producing interpretable uncertainty maps.

Conclusion: Twin-Boot successfully integrates uncertainty estimation directly into the optimization process, overcoming limitations of traditional bootstrapping while providing better regularization and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

TL;DR: Federated learning improves convergence for nonlinear system identification as client count increases, with feature map design enabling better performance than centralized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish theoretical guarantees for federated nonlinear system identification and demonstrate its advantages over centralized methods, particularly how increasing client participation improves convergence rates.

Method: Federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems using theoretical analysis and experimental validation with physical systems (pendulum, quadrotor) driven by i.i.d. control inputs and random perturbations, employing real-analytic feature functions including polynomial and trigonometric components.

Result: Convergence rate improves as number of clients increases; federated learning consistently enhances individual client convergence; performance depends on feature map design which can increase excitation; validated under varying noise levels and data distributions.

Conclusion: Federated nonlinear system identification provides superior convergence compared to centralized approaches, with the constant improvement factor dependent on careful feature map selection, making it effective for physical system applications.

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses overlooked challenges in layer-freezing techniques for DNN training, proposing similarity-aware channel augmentation and progressive compression to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional layer-freezing methods still require forward propagation through frozen layers, limiting computational savings. Caching feature maps presents challenges like effective augmentation application and substantial storage overhead that prior literature has overlooked.

Method: Proposes similarity-aware channel augmentation to cache channels with high augmentation sensitivity, and incorporates lossy data compression with progressive compression strategy that increases compression rates as more layers are frozen.

Result: Achieves significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy with minor time overhead. Provides comprehensive evaluation of freezing and compression strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively addresses the overlooked challenges in layer-freezing techniques, enabling substantial computational cost reduction without compromising model performance, with insights for optimizing efficient DNN training.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

*Syomantak Chaudhuri,Jerry Li,Thomas A. Courtade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tight minimax rates for robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption rates, showing optimal estimators discard samples beyond corruption threshold determined by empirical distribution of corruption rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address robust estimation in settings with non-identical corruption probabilities per sample, which arises naturally in distributed learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks - overcoming limitations of existing methods that assume uniform corruption.

Method: Theoretical analysis establishing minimax rates for mean estimation of multivariate bounded distributions, univariate Gaussian distributions, multivariate Gaussian mean estimation, and linear regression under heterogeneous corruption patterns.

Result: Achieved tight minimax rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns in bounded and univariate Gaussian cases, and up to âd factor for multivariate Gaussian and linear regression. Found optimal estimators discard samples beyond a corruption threshold.

Conclusion: Structural heterogeneity in corruption rates significantly impacts robust estimation performance, with optimal strategies involving selective sample discarding based on empirical corruption distribution rather than uniform treatment.

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

*Rustem Islamov,Niccolo Ajroldi,Antonio Orvieto,Aurelien Lucchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes NGN-M, a momentum-based optimizer with adaptive step-size that improves stability and matches state-of-the-art performance while being less sensitive to hyperparameter choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern momentum and adaptive step-size optimizers are effective but highly sensitive to hyperparameter tuning, which is resource-intensive and time-consuming. There's a need for more stable optimizers across a wide range of hyperparameter choices.

Method: Introduces NGN-M, a momentum-based version of the NGN step-size method. The algorithm combines momentum with adaptive step-size adaptation to achieve better stability and performance without requiring restrictive assumptions like interpolation condition or bounded stochastic gradients.

Result: NGN-M attains the standard convergence rate of O(1/âK) under less restrictive assumptions. Empirically demonstrates enhanced robustness to step-size hyperparameter choices while delivering performance comparable to or surpassing other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Conclusion: The combination of momentum with NGN step-size adaptation creates a more robust optimizer that maintains high performance while reducing sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, addressing a key challenge in modern deep learning optimization.

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

*Yen-Lung Lai,Zhe Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DNNs in overparameterized regimes exhibit output space collapse that improves generalization but can lead to degeneracy where distinct inputs map to same outputs, solved by a novel "wormhole" solution that reconciles meaningful and random labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why DNNs confidently classify random inputs (fooling examples) and investigate generalization behavior beyond conventional gradient-based approaches.

Method: Analytical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation, avoiding traditional numerical optimization and explicit labels, with investigation of overparameterized DNN regimes.

Result: DNNs show output feature space collapse that enhances generalization, but excessive layers cause degeneracy (trivial solutions with zero loss). A "wormhole" solution successfully bypasses this degeneracy and reconciles meaningful labels with random ones.

Conclusion: The findings provide deeper insights into DNN generalization mechanisms and shortcut learning, suggesting future research directions for unsupervised learning dynamics to bridge theory-practice gaps.

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

*Moghis Fereidouni,Muhammad Umair Haider,Peizhong Ju,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAEs reduce polysemanticity and enable more precise concept-level control compared to base models, but greater sparsity doesn't always improve separability and can hurt downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polysemanticity in LLMs makes interpretation difficult, and while sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been proposed to address this, there's been no quantitative comparison with base models regarding monosemanticity.

Method: Introduced a fine-grained concept separability score based on Jensen-Shannon distance, evaluated Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, and proposed Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP) for targeted concept suppression.

Result: SAEs reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability than base models, enable more precise concept-level control with partial suppression, and APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Conclusion: SAEs are effective for improving interpretability and enabling precise concept-level interventions, though sparsity-utility tradeoffs exist, and the proposed APP method provides superior targeted concept control.

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted

*Siddharth Chaudhary,Bennett Browning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra is a 1.6B parameter hybrid architecture combining SSM backbone, sparse attention, MoE routing, and dual memory systems for efficient long-context language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create efficient long-context language models by integrating multiple advanced techniques (conditional computation, memory mechanisms, sparse MoE) within a compact parameter budget while maintaining scalability.

Method: Combines Mamba-style SSM backbone with intermittent sparse global attention, chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual memory systems (workspace + factual PKM). Uses staged curriculum training and provides transparent parameter accounting.

Result: Implementation feasibility demonstrated through toy-scale prototypes showing long-context throughput crossover and controllable expert routing behaviors. No competitive full-scale performance claims yet.

Conclusion: Hydra presents a blueprint for modular, input-adaptive long-context models combining SSM efficiency, sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory. End-task validation at target scale remains future work.

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

*Shaswati Saha,Sourajit Saha,Manas Gaur,Tejas Gokhale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Concept Erasure Techniques (CETs) for text-to-image models can be easily bypassed using hierarchical and compositional prompts, suffer from attribute leakage, and exhibit attention concentration/dispersal side effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy, copyright, and safety concerns in text-to-image generative models by developing robust evaluation methods for Concept Erasure Techniques.

Method: Proposed Side Effect Evaluation (SEE) benchmark with hierarchical and compositional prompts, automated evaluation pipeline to measure impact on neighboring concepts, target evasion, and attribute leakage.

Result: CETs can be circumvented through superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, suffer from attribute leakage, and show attention concentration/dispersal phenomena.

Conclusion: Current CETs have significant vulnerabilities and side effects, requiring more robust approaches for effective concept erasure in text-to-image models.

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

*Sk Miraj Ahmed,Umit Yigit Basaran,Dripta S. Raychaudhuri,Arindam Dutta,Rohit Kundu,Fahim Faisal Niloy,Basak Guler,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for source-free machine unlearning that estimates Hessian of remaining training data without accessing original dataset, enabling efficient zero-shot unlearning with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods require access to entire training dataset, which is impractical in real-world scenarios where original data may not be accessible due to privacy regulations or other constraints.

Method: Proposes a technique to estimate the Hessian of unknown remaining training data, building on recent work. This estimation enables efficient zero-shot unlearning without requiring access to the original training dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in removing specific data while maintaining performance on remaining data.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the source-free unlearning challenge, providing robust theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency for removing private or copyrighted information from trained models without original data access.

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

### [62] [Universal Reinforcement Learning in Coalgebras: Asynchronous Stochastic Computation via Conduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15128)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces universal reinforcement learning (URL), a categorial generalization of RL using coalgebras, topos theory, and distributed computation. It shows how RL algorithms can be modeled as functor categories and generalizes fixed-point finding to determining final coalgebras asynchronously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more abstract and mathematically rigorous foundation for reinforcement learning by leveraging category theory, coalgebras, and topos theory, enabling generalization beyond traditional MDP frameworks.

Method: Uses category theory and functors to model RL algorithms, introduces universal coalgebras to represent dynamical systems, and generalizes fixed-point computation to asynchronous determination of final coalgebras in distributed settings.

Result: Establishes URL as a categorial framework that subsumes traditional RL models (MDPs, POMDPs, PSRs, LDSs) and provides mathematical abstractions for asynchronous distributed computation through coalgebraic structures.

Conclusion: URL provides a powerful mathematical foundation for reinforcement learning that enables generalization across various dynamical system models and supports asynchronous parallel distributed computation through categorial and coalgebraic methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

TL;DR: Reproducibility study of 11 state-of-the-art differentially private machine learning techniques reveals inconsistent performance, with some methods failing outside original experimental conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent proliferation of differentially private ML papers with claimed state-of-the-art results lacks consensus on effectiveness and faces challenges in direct comparisons due to heterogeneous codebases, datasets, and methodologies.

Method: Conducted reproducibility and replicability experiments on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from recent literature, addressing challenges unique to DPML reproducibility including additional randomness from DP noise.

Result: Varied outcomes - some methods performed as claimed while others faltered when tested outside their initial experimental conditions.

Conclusion: Derived insights and best practices for obtaining scientifically valid and reliable results in differentially private machine learning research.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeLLM is an unlearning-based defense framework that removes harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and general capabilities through a three-stage pipeline involving unsafe output detection, harmful content tracing, and constrained optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak attacks pose serious threats to LLM safety by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms, causing models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic unsafe output detection using hybrid external classifiers and model-internal evaluations, (2) token-level harmful content tracing through FFN activations, (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without degrading model quality.

Result: Substantially reduces attack success rates across multiple jailbreak benchmarks on Vicuna, LLaMA, and GPT-J while maintaining high general-purpose performance. Outperforms standard defense methods like supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

Conclusion: Unlearning is a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety, offering stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and greater robustness to unseen attacks while maintaining general performance.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairPrep is a benchmarking framework for evaluating fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular data, addressing the lack of standardized tools for data-level bias mitigation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-processing methods for algorithmic fairness have received less attention than in-processing and post-processing approaches, despite advantages like model-agnosticism and better privacy compliance. There's a need for standardized evaluation tools for data-level fairness interventions.

Method: Built on AIF360 platform, FairPrep provides an extensible and modular framework with seamless integration of datasets, fairness interventions, and predictive models. It features batch-processing interface for efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and utility metrics.

Result: The framework enables standardized pipelines and reproducible evaluations of pre-processing fairness techniques, filling a critical gap in fairness benchmarking.

Conclusion: FairPrep provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness research by offering a comprehensive benchmarking solution for pre-processing methods.

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness

TL;DR: Enhanced tensor neural networks with frequency-adaptive approach using random Fourier features and discrete Fourier transform to overcome Frequency Principle limitations in high-dimensional multi-scale problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) suffer from Frequency Principle limitations that restrict their ability to capture high-frequency features in high-dimensional problems, similar to conventional neural networks.

Method: Proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs incorporating random Fourier features and leveraging tensor structure to perform Discrete Fourier Transform on one-dimensional component functions, effectively mitigating curse of dimensionality.

Result: Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm, showing significant improvement in solving complex multi-scale problems.

Conclusion: The frequency-adaptive approach significantly enhances TNNs' expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by better capturing high-frequency features while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

TL;DR: SleepDIFFormer - a transformer-based method for automated sleep stage classification using joint EEG-EOG signals with cross-domain alignment to improve generalization across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual sleep stage classification is time-consuming and error-prone. Existing ML/DL methods struggle with non-stationarity and variability of EEG/EOG signals, leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets.

Method: Multivariate Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) with MDTA architecture for joint EEG-EOG representation learning, using cross-domain alignment to mitigate attention noise and learn domain-invariant features.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on five different sleep staging datasets, with thorough ablation analyses showing relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.

Conclusion: SleepDIFFormer advances automated sleep stage classification with improved generalization capabilities, enabling better sleep quality assessment applications.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-Attribution Learning (MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple attribution mechanisms instead of using just one, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CVR prediction approaches restrict training to labels from a single attribution mechanism, discarding complementary signals from alternative attribution perspectives that could better capture underlying conversion patterns.

Method: MAL framework with two core components: Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (multi-task learner integrating diverse attribution labels) and Primary Target Predictor (generating calibrated probabilities for system-optimized attribution). Uses CAT training strategy with Cartesian product of attribution labels for enriched supervision.

Result: Offline: +0.51% GAUC improvement. Online: +2.6% increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Conclusion: Integrating multiple attribution perspectives through the MAL framework significantly enhances CVR prediction performance compared to single-attribution approaches, demonstrating both offline metric improvements and real-world business value.

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for synthesizing Pareto-optimal interpretations of black-box ML models with local optimality guarantees, balancing accuracy and explainability using SAT solvers for verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the conflict between accuracy and explainability in ML model interpretations, and overcoming scalability limitations of methods with formal guarantees on Pareto-optimality.

Method: Uses multi-objective learning/search techniques (like Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search) to generate candidate interpretations, then verifies local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem solved with SAT solvers.

Result: Demonstrated efficacy on benchmarks, showing interpretations closely match those from methods with global guarantees while being more scalable.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables scalable synthesis of interpretations with local optimality guarantees, effectively balancing accuracy and explainability trade-offs.

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

TL;DR: Poly-window contrastive learning framework for ECG analysis that extracts multiple temporal windows to learn temporally invariant features, outperforming traditional two-view methods with higher efficiency and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG analysis is limited by scarce annotated data. Existing self-supervised methods only use pairwise augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG recordings.

Method: Extracts multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired by slow feature analysis to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features.

Result: Outperforms conventional two-view methods on PTB-XL dataset: higher AUROC (0.891 vs 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs 0.679) with 4x fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs 128) and 14.8% total time reduction.

Conclusion: Poly-window contrastive learning is highly efficient and scalable for automated ECG analysis, providing a promising general framework for self-supervised representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks

TL;DR: CSG complexity metric fails to perform as claimed in knowledge graph link prediction, showing sensitivity to parameters and weak correlation with performance. Better metrics like Relation Entropy and Relation Type Cardinality show stronger correlations with task difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric for dataset complexity in knowledge graph link prediction settings, as it had not been tested in KG contexts despite claims about its classifier-agnostic properties and correlation with downstream performance.

Method: Examined CSG in multi-relational link prediction using transformer-derived embeddings, introduced and benchmarked structural and semantic KG complexity metrics including Relation Entropy, Maximum Relation Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality, and analyzed correlations with standard performance metrics (MRR, Hit@1, Hit@10).

Result: CSG was highly sensitive to parameterization and did not robustly scale with number of classes. It showed weak/inconsistent correlation with MRR and Hit@1. Relation Entropy, Maximum Relation Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibited strong inverse correlations with MRR and Hit@1, while graph connectivity measures correlated positively with Hit@10.

Conclusion: CSG's claimed stability and generalization predictive power do not hold in link prediction settings. The study underscores the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned complexity measures in knowledge-driven learning, with relational ambiguity metrics showing promise as better indicators of task difficulty.

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

*Zhaorui Tan,Yijie Hu,Xi Yang,Qiufeng Wang,Anh Nguyen,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PL-Reg introduces partial-logic regularization to handle unknown classes in visual classification, improving generalization without requiring fully defined logical formulas like previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for handling unknown classes either favor known classes (class discovery) or suffer from catastrophic forgetting (incremental learning). Logic-based methods like L-Reg require fully defined formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown classes.

Method: PL-Reg uses partial-logic regularization that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas, enabling better adaptability to unknown classes. The approach is formally demonstrated to work with partial logic for unknown class tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery, and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks show consistent performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: Partial logic regularization effectively addresses challenges with unknown classes in visual classification, providing improved generalization capabilities compared to fully defined logic approaches.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExBigBang is a hybrid text-tabular transformer model for explainable persona classification that integrates contextual features and provides interpretable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional persona classification models lack contextual understanding and explainability, making it difficult to capture real user needs and justify predictions in complex user interaction scenarios.

Method: A hybrid transformer-based architecture that combines textual and tabular data, incorporating metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling through a cyclical process that dynamically updates with evolving user behaviors.

Result: Experiments show robust performance on benchmark datasets, with ablation studies confirming the benefits of text-tabular integration and Explainable AI techniques providing interpretable predictions.

Conclusion: ExBigBang successfully addresses the limitations of previous persona classification models by providing contextual understanding, dynamic updating, and explainable predictions through hybrid text-tabular transformer architecture.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-users can coordinate to strategically relabel their own data to improve model fairness without changing the firm's training process, using three model-agnostic methods that significantly reduce unfairness with minimal impact on overall accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often preserve biases from training data, unfairly treating minority groups. Existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques require organizational buy-in and incur utility costs, while many models rely on user-contributed data.

Method: Three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate ideal relabeling within the Algorithmic Collective Action framework, where coordinated minority groups strategically relabel their own data without altering the firm's training process.

Result: A subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with only a small impact on the overall prediction error, as validated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: End-user collective action through strategic data relabeling provides an effective alternative to firm-side bias mitigation, enabling fairness improvements without requiring organizational changes or significant utility trade-offs.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

### [78] [EvoFormer: Learning Dynamic Graph-Level Representations with Structural and Temporal Bias Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15378)
*Haodi Zhong,Liuxin Zou,Di Wang,Bo Wang,Zhenxing Niu,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoFormer is a Transformer framework for dynamic graph embedding that addresses structural visit bias and abrupt evolution blindness through structure-aware and evolution-sensitive modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic graph embedding methods suffer from Structural Visit Bias (uneven node sampling) and Abrupt Evolution Blindness (inability to detect sudden structural changes), leading to noisy representations and inconsistent temporal embeddings.

Method: EvoFormer uses a Structure-Aware Transformer Module with node structural role positional encoding to mitigate structural bias, and an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal Module with a three-step strategy: random walk timestamp classification, graph-level temporal segmentation, and segment-aware temporal self-attention with edge evolution prediction.

Result: Extensive evaluations on five benchmark datasets show EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: EvoFormer effectively corrects structural and temporal biases in dynamic graph representation learning, demonstrating superior performance across multiple tasks by addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical shortage of large-scale benchmark datasets for heterogeneous text-attributed graphs (TAGs), which hinders development and fair comparison of representation learning methods in this domain.

Method: Created CITE dataset with over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges spanning four relation types. Established standardized evaluation procedures and conducted extensive benchmarking on node classification tasks, comparing four learning paradigms: homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph models, LLM-centric models, and LLM+Graph models.

Result: The paper introduces the CITE benchmark dataset and provides comprehensive baseline experiments across diverse modeling paradigms, enabling standardized evaluation of representation learning methods on heterogeneous TAGs.

Conclusion: CITE serves as a crucial benchmark for catalytic materials research and provides standardized protocols for evaluating heterogeneous text-attributed graph learning methods, facilitating fair comparisons and advancing the field.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods require pre-selecting the number of clusters, which is impractical in federated learning where data is distributed across devices and cannot be centralized for analysis.

Method: Developed an evolving fuzzy system within federated learning framework using PyTorch, allowing dynamic cluster addition without apriori cluster count selection. Models are trained locally on client devices with only parameter sharing to central server.

Result: Outperformed established classification methods on multiple UCI datasets, demonstrating superior performance in clustering and classification tasks within decentralized environments.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers significant advantages for decentralized data processing in federated learning, though it remains computationally intensive due to overlap condition calculations.

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid least squares/gradient descent method for efficient DeepONet training by decomposing large linear system into smaller subproblems for branch and trunk networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate DeepONet training by leveraging the linear structure of the output with respect to last layer parameters, avoiding the infeasible direct solution of the prohibitively large linear system.

Method: Decompose the large least squares system into two smaller subproblems for branch and trunk networks separately, and solve them using a hybrid approach combining least squares for linear parameters and gradient descent for hidden layers.

Result: The method enables efficient optimization of DeepONet parameters, making training feasible for large-scale problems that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach successfully addresses the computational challenges of DeepONet training by decomposing the problem into manageable subproblems, extending to regularized L^2 loss and physics-informed unsupervised learning scenarios.

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) models suffer from performance degradation when deployed to new users due to user-induced concept drift, highlighting the need for efficient personalization methods.

Method: A hybrid framework that updates only the classifier layer with user-specific data using few-shot learning directly on energy-efficient RISC-V-based microcontrollers. Implemented on GAP9 microcontroller and validated across three HAR scenarios.

Result: Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements: 3.73% on RecGym, 17.38% on QVAR-Gesture, and 3.70% on Ultrasound-Gesture.

Conclusion: Fast, lightweight, and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, enabling scalable and user-aware HAR systems in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

TL;DR: Proposes a fast dissimilarity measure for detecting overlapping multivariate Gaussian clusters in data streams, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning from data streams requires adaptive clustering models that can handle conceptual drift, but existing distribution dissimilarity measures are inadequate for detecting overlapping clusters due to computational demands and inability to handle all cluster shapes.

Method: A new dissimilarity measure specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity, which can be computed faster than existing methods and handles multivariate Gaussian clusters.

Result: The proposed method is several times faster than compared methods and successfully detects overlapping clusters while avoiding merging of orthogonal clusters.

Conclusion: The new measure provides an efficient solution for detecting overlapping clusters in streaming data, overcoming computational limitations and shape constraints of existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

TL;DR: MRP uses irreversible projection transformations in hidden state space to completely eliminate harmful information from LLMs while preserving useful knowledge, enabling effective continuous unlearning and defense against relearning attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods only suppress undesired data activation through parametric training without completely eradicating informational traces, making them vulnerable to relearning attacks and ineffective for continuous unlearning.

Method: Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) applies irreversible projection properties by implementing projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network layers to eliminate harmful information.

Result: Experimental results show MRP enables effective continuous unlearning, successfully defends against relearning attacks, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness while preserving natural model performance.

Conclusion: MRP overcomes fundamental limitations of existing unlearning approaches by completely eliminating harmful information traces through irreversible projections, providing a robust solution for ensuring LLM safety through effective machine unlearning.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a mathematically tractable model that captures the synaptic switching behavior of dynamic molecular switches while maintaining stability properties for neuromorphic computing applications.

Method: Analysis of a linear-in-state, nonlinear-in-input differential equation model that is exactly solvable, examining its convergence and fading memory properties for time-varying input processing.

Result: The model demonstrates co-existence of biologically-inspired synaptic behavior and desirable mathematical properties (convergence, fading memory) enabling stable learning on sequential data.

Conclusion: This provides theoretical foundation for using dynamic molecular switches as computational units in neuromorphic architectures and inspires development of more general exactly solvable models for brain-inspired physical devices.

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

TL;DR: BaVerLy is a group local robustness verifier that speeds up neural network verification by batching similar input regions and verifying them jointly, achieving 2.3x average speedup over traditional one-by-one verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural network verifiers for adversarial robustness are either too slow or imprecise when analyzing large sets of input regions, making them ineffective for practical applications.

Method: Proposes BaVerLy - a sound and complete verifier that dynamically constructs mini-batches of similar Îµ-balls, verifies them jointly, and uses adaptive refinement when verification fails.

Result: Achieves 2.3x average speedup and up to 4.1x speedup, reducing analysis time from 24 hours to 6 hours in best cases on MNIST and CIFAR-10 networks.

Conclusion: Group verification through mini-batching of similar input regions significantly improves the efficiency of neural network robustness verification while maintaining soundness and completeness.

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

TL;DR: HypSeek is a hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds protein-ligand interactions in Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, improving virtual screening and affinity ranking performance by better capturing hierarchical structures and fine-grained affinity variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Euclidean embedding methods fail to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations intrinsic to molecular interactions, particularly in challenging cases like activity cliffs where structurally similar ligands show large affinity gaps.

Method: A hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space using a protein-guided three-tower architecture to leverage the exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space.

Result: Significant improvements: early enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E increased from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and affinity ranking correlation on JACS improved from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%).

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry provides powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand modeling, enabling expressive affinity-sensitive embeddings that effectively model both global activity and subtle functional differences across virtual screening and affinity ranking tasks.

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

TL;DR: FairGuide is a novel framework that enhances fairness in Graph Neural Networks by introducing new links to guide biased graph structures toward unbiased ones, using differentiable community detection and meta-gradients to improve structural fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks face fairness challenges due to biases in graph structures, and existing biased structures need guidance toward unbiased ones through new links to foster fair communities.

Method: Proposes FairGuide framework with differentiable community detection as pseudo downstream task, uses meta-gradients from fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that enhance structural fairness.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness and generalizability across various graph-based fairness tasks.

Conclusion: FairGuide successfully addresses fairness challenges in GNNs by structurally guiding graphs toward unbiased configurations through strategic link additions.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

*Xiaoxing Ren,Nicola Bastianello,Karl H. Johansson,Thomas Parisini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel ADMM-based distributed learning algorithm that is both computation-efficient (using stochastic gradients) and communication-efficient (multiple local epochs + compressed transmissions), with proven linear convergence for strongly convex problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient distributed learning over networks by reducing both computational burden and communication overhead, which are critical bottlenecks in distributed systems.

Method: Developed an ADMM-based algorithm that uses stochastic gradients for local computation efficiency, performs multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and employs compressed transmissions to reduce communication costs.

Result: The algorithm achieves exact linear convergence in strongly convex settings and demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques in classification tasks through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully balances computation and communication efficiency while maintaining strong theoretical convergence guarantees, making it suitable for practical distributed learning applications over networks.

Abstract: We address distributed learning problems over undirected networks.
Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is
jointly computation- and communication-efficient. Our design guarantees
computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during
local training. Moreover, communication efficiency is achieved as follows: i)
the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and
ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the
algorithm in the strongly convex setting. We corroborate our theoretical
results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a
classification task.

### [90] [Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function: Differential Privacy without Gradient Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15523)
*Salman Habib,Remi Chou,Taejoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPOF is a differentially private training mechanism for multi-user LDP that perturbs polynomial approximations of loss functions instead of gradients, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than DP-SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-based DP methods like DP-SGD require injecting noise into gradients, which reduces computational efficiency and stability in multi-user environments with heterogeneous data and environmental noise.

Method: SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of the training loss function, adding calibrated noise to polynomial coefficients to privatize each user's data while supporting simultaneous privacy guarantees.

Result: SPOF achieves up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to multi-user DP-SGD in WBAN scenarios with heterogeneous data and stochastic channel noise.

Conclusion: SPOF provides superior privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user LDP settings, offering improved computational efficiency, stability, and robustness to environmental noise compared to gradient-based approaches.

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

TL;DR: Practical early fault detection for industrial pumps using sensor data and machine learning with hybrid thresholding and synthetic fault injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable early fault detection in industrial pump systems operating in demanding environments to enable proactive maintenance and prevent failures.

Method: Monitored 5 operational parameters, used dual-threshold labeling (fixed engineering limits + adaptive 95th percentile), injected synthetic fault signals, and trained Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM classifiers for multi-class detection.

Result: Random Forest and XGBoost achieved high accuracy across all classes including rare faults, while SVM showed lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual analyses confirmed robust detection capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable, interpretable, real-time fault detection suitable for industrial deployment and adaptable to other machinery with similar sensor architectures.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Result: Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical insights into model behavior for both multi-class classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: This work advances explainable AI and uncertainty quantification by providing a rigorous framework for enhancing model interpretability and reliability, laying groundwork for responsible AI deployment.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical

*Wei Herng Choong,Jixing Liu,Ching-Yu Kao,Philip Sperl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRASPED is an unsupervised graph anomaly detection model that uses spectral analysis with graph wavelet convolution and Wiener deconvolution to capture multi-scale information without requiring labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised methods suffer from limited labeled anomaly data, while unsupervised approaches either rely only on spatial information or use low-pass filters that lose multi-band analysis capabilities for detecting spectral shifts caused by anomalies.

Method: Proposes GRASPED with Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder and Wiener Graph Deconvolution-based decoder, featuring structural and attribute decoders that provide bandpass filter characteristics for multi-scale global and local information capture.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world graph anomaly detection datasets show that GRASPED outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The unsupervised GRASPED model effectively captures anomaly information through spectral analysis and multi-scale reconstruction, addressing limitations of both supervised and existing unsupervised approaches in graph anomaly detection.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new fully inductive and amortized simulation-based inference framework that integrates calibration and distribution alignment into an end-to-end trainable model, overcoming limitations of previous transductive approaches like RoPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address model misspecification in SBI - the mismatch between simulated and real-world observations caused by modeling simplifications. Overcome limitations of RoPE which requires batch test samples at inference time, limiting scalability and generalization.

Method: Uses mini-batch optimal transport with closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations corresponding to same latent parameters. Combines paired calibration data and unpaired samples. Trains conditional normalizing flow to approximate OT-induced posterior for efficient inference without simulation access at test time.

Result: Matches or surpasses performance of RoPE and other standard SBI/non-SBI estimators across synthetic and real-world benchmarks including complex medical biomarker estimation.

Conclusion: Proposed framework offers improved scalability and applicability in challenging, misspecified environments while maintaining competitive performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Conclusion: This survey serves as both a theoretical synthesis demonstrating the shared probabilistic foundations of AI methods and a practical guide for navigating machine learning's evolving landscape, connecting classical estimation theory with modern deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoNTM is a continual neural topic model that learns new topics over time without forgetting previous ones, outperforming dynamic topic models in quality and perplexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topic models either require full corpus access (DTMs) or lack long-term memory (online models), creating a gap for continual learning without forgetting.

Method: Uses a global prior distribution that is continuously updated to maintain previously learned topics while incorporating new data over time.

Result: Consistently outperforms dynamic topic models in topic quality and predictive perplexity, captures more diverse topics and better temporal changes.

Conclusion: CoNTM successfully bridges the gap between dynamic and online topic models by enabling continual learning with long-term memory preservation.

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian analysis shows automated audio classifiers significantly distort language acquisition research estimates, with errors reducing sibling effect detection by 20-80%. A calibration method helps but isn't foolproof.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how classification errors in automated audio analysis affect scientific measurements and statistical inferences in language acquisition studies, particularly given the widespread use of wearable recorders.

Method: Proposes a Bayesian approach to study algorithmic error effects on key research questions, examining both LENA system and open-source Voice Type Classifier from ACLEW system.

Result: Classification errors significantly distort estimates - automated annotations underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20-80%, potentially making effects statistically insignificant.

Conclusion: Bayesian calibration can help recover unbiased effect size estimates but isn't perfect. The issue affects any classifier with non-zero error rates in event detection and classification tasks.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework that provides formal guarantees of individual fairness throughout machine learning training using provably fair initialization and fairness-preserving training with randomized response mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness training methods lack formal guarantees, and verification-based approaches don't actively enhance fairness during training while being computationally expensive.

Method: Two-part approach: (1) provably fair initialization to start in a fair state, and (2) fairness-preserving training algorithm using randomized response mechanisms to protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness guarantees.

Result: Experimental evaluations show the approach produces empirically fair and accurate models, and is much more efficient than certified training approaches that require neural network verification.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully provides formal individual fairness guarantees throughout training while maintaining model accuracy and computational efficiency compared to verification-based alternatives.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is crucial for precision pharmacotherapy, but traditional methods require lengthy model-development cycles and expert modeling.

Method: Transformer-based latent-variable framework that unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian inference, pre-trained on synthetic pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors.

Result: AICMET achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy, faithfully quantifies inter-patient variability, and outperforms both nonlinear mixed-effects baselines and neural ODE variants.

Conclusion: Transformer-based population-aware neural architectures offer a viable alternative to traditional pharmacokinetic modeling, enabling rapid personalized dosing regimens with reduced expert modeling requirements.

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of modeling heterogeneous subpopulations with varying characteristics and behaviors through personalized modeling approaches.

Result: Superior performance compared to benchmarks in simulation and case study datasets, especially in high-variability scenarios, with improved prediction accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enables efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar tasks while preserving unique subpopulation characteristics, revealing underlying patterns for model personalization.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world AI deployment requires social intelligence and multi-agent cooperation, but current research is limited by the lack of open-ended multi-agent environments that reflect complex real-world challenges.

Method: The authors developed a multi-agent environment where self-interested agents pursue complex independent goals, enabling study of social learning from experts, implicit cooperation, and emergent collaborative behaviors.

Result: The environment allows investigation of how social learning impacts agent performance, whether agents benefit from cooperation or competition, and the emergence of collaborative tool use and long-horizon goal achievement.

Conclusion: This environment enables crucial research into socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent settings, addressing key challenges for real-world AI deployment through the study of expert learning and emergent cooperation.

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Method: Generalized augmented Lagrangian method with multiple penalty parameters, reformulated constraint enforcement as expectations, incorporated Fourier feature mappings, introduced time-windowing strategy, and proposed conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy.

Result: PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive accuracy across various problems including transonic rarefaction, vortex advection, high-wavenumber Helmholtz/Poisson equations, and inverse heat source identification, outperforming established methods and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks.

Conclusion: The proposed advances significantly improve PECANN's robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding scientific computing problems with heterogeneous constraints and multi-scale features.

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

### [104] [Investigation of D-Wave quantum annealing for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines and mitigating catastrophic forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15697)
*Abdelmoula El-Yazizi,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores modest performance differences between D-Wave quantum annealing and classical MCMC sampling for Restricted Boltzmann Machines, finding no RBM training improvements but demonstrating potential for catastrophic forgetting mitigation through generative replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain why previous investigations showed no significant improvements in RBM trainability when using D-Wave quantum annealing sampling compared to classical MCMC methods, and to explore potential benefits of hybrid sampling approaches.

Method: A novel hybrid sampling approach combining classical MCMC and quantum annealing contributions was investigated. The study also examined embedding RBMs into newer D-Wave hardware and tested quantum annealing-generated patterns for catastrophic forgetting mitigation through generative replay.

Result: No improvements in RBM training were achieved. The differences between QA and MCMC sampling were mainly found in medium-to-low probability regions, which are less important for sample quality. However, QA demonstrated ability to generate diverse samples from lower-probability regions, showing comparable efficiency to classical methods for catastrophic forgetting mitigation with potential for speed advantages.

Conclusion: While quantum annealing sampling doesn't benefit RBM training due to insufficient differences in critical sampling regions, it shows promise for machine learning applications requiring diverse pattern generation, particularly for catastrophic forgetting mitigation where speed and pattern variety are advantageous.

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

### [105] [Communication Efficient LLM Pre-training with SparseLoCo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15706)
*Amir Sarfi,Benjamin ThÃ©rien,Joel Lidin,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoCo is a communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that combines Top-k sparsification and quantization to achieve extreme compression ratios (1-3% sparsity, 2-bit quantization) while outperforming full-precision methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed training of LLMs faces communication bottlenecks in bandwidth-constrained settings like cross-datacenter links, and existing methods still require full gradient communication and can degrade performance.

Method: Uses Top-k sparsification and quantization with local approximation of outer momentum through error feedback and aggressive sparsity. Leverages sparse aggregation to improve model performance.

Result: Achieves compression ratios up to 1-3% sparsity with 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision DiLoCo in various communication-constrained LLM training settings.

Conclusion: SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication cost for LLM training in bandwidth-constrained environments.

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

### [106] [Probability Density from Latent Diffusion Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15737)
*Joonas JÃ¤rve,Karl Kaspar Haavel,Meelis Kull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether likelihood-based out-of-distribution detection fails due to pixel space limitations or fundamental representation issues, by training a Variational Diffusion Model on ResNet-18 representations instead of images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite likelihood being theoretically optimal for OOD detection under uniform OOD assumption, it often fails in practice. The authors want to determine if this failure is due to pixel space limitations in generative models or a more fundamental problem with representation learning.

Method: Trained a Variational Diffusion Model on the representation space of a pre-trained ResNet-18 (instead of pixel space) and evaluated likelihood-based OOD detection performance against state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Result: The paper compares the performance of their representation-space likelihood detector with existing methods, though specific results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The study aims to determine whether likelihood-based OOD detection failures stem from pixel space limitations or deeper issues in representation learning, potentially offering insights for improving OOD detection in practical applications.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between open-source and closed-source models in challenging scientific fields and advance toward AGI by developing specialized generalist models for scientific multimodal data analysis.

Method: 28B parameter multimodal Mixture-of-Experts model pre-trained on 5T tokens (2.5T scientific), using offline+online RL training with Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) on 1000+ tasks simultaneously in InternBootCamp.

Result: Top-tier performance in online RL training, competitive on general reasoning tasks, significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, and surpasses closed-source SOTA models in professional tasks like molecular synthesis planning and crystal stability prediction.

Conclusion: Intern-S1 demonstrates that specialized generalist models with integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and training systems can effectively bridge the gap between open-source and closed-source models in scientific domains while maintaining general reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

Abstract: Coordinating workflows across heterogeneous control systems remains a central
challenge in safety-critical environments such as scientific facilities,
industrial plants, and energy infrastructures. Language-model-driven agents
offer a natural interface for these tasks, but existing approaches often lack
scalability, reliability, and human oversight. We introduce the Alpha Berkeley
Framework, a production-ready architecture for scalable agentic systems that
integrate conversational context with robust tool orchestration. The framework
features dynamic capability classification to select only relevant tools per
task, a plan-first orchestration model that generates execution plans with
explicit dependencies and optional human approval, context-aware task
extraction that combines dialogue history with external memory and domain
resources, and production-ready execution environments with checkpointing,
artifact management, and modular deployment. We demonstrate its versatility
through two case studies: a tutorial-style wind farm monitoring example and a
deployment at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator. These results
establish Alpha Berkeley as a reliable and transparent framework for agentic
systems in high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: HEAS is a Python framework that combines agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and tournament evaluation in a unified workflow for reproducible multi-level simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a standardized framework that unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and tournament evaluation, reducing glue code and improving comparability across studies while ensuring reproducibility.

Method: Uses hierarchical lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in deterministic layers that read/write shared context, with API/CLI for simulation, optimization, evaluation, PyTorch integration, and tournament tooling with customizable scoring rules.

Result: The framework enables explicit cross-scale couplings, standardized evaluation metrics, persistence of seeds and archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces and Pareto fronts, allowing the same model to be used for simulation, optimization, or comparison.

Conclusion: HEAS offers a practical foundation for cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry that yields reliable and reproducible results, demonstrated through ecological and enterprise decision-making examples.

Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that
unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and
tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents
models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in
deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale
couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize,
evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy
integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament
tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes
evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,
logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,
Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving
comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from
orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators
to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be
used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We
illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an
enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for
cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible
results.
