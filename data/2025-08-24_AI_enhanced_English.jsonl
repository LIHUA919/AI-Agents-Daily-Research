However, most existing\nwork does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where\nagent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering\nand fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.\n  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to\ncontrol agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system\nand language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs\nconditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to\ncontrol the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial\nand social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation\nand each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to\ncontrol the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables\nagents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the\nongoing dialogue.\n  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay\nbetween social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we\nobserve that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.\nAdditionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an\ninformation-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework\nproduces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours\narising naturally from any environmental setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "A novel agent-based crowd simulation method using LLMs to generate dialogue and drive navigation, enabling more realistic social interactions and emergent group behaviors.", "motivation": "Existing crowd simulations lack complex social and environmental interactions driven by language, limiting agent-agent and agent-environment interactions to basic steering and goal extrapolation.", "method": "Uses LLMs with agent personalities, roles, and relationships to generate inter-agent dialogue, then uses conversations plus perceptual inputs to control navigation and steering decisions.", "result": "Validated in complex scenarios showing automatic grouping/ungrouping of agents and information-passing within crowds, producing more realistic simulations with emergent group behaviors.", "conclusion": "The framework successfully integrates language-driven social interactions with navigation, enabling more natural and realistic crowd simulations with emergent behaviors from environmental settings."}}
