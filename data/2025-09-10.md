### [1] [Renewable Energy Sources Selection Analysis with the Maximizing Deviation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07011)
*Kirisci Murat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a Fermatean fuzzy-based optimization model for renewable energy source selection using multi-criteria decision-making with partially known feature weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty in human judgments and provide better decision-making tools for complex situations, particularly in renewable energy selection which is crucial for meeting energy needs while balancing carbon emissions and climate change impacts.

Method: Uses Fermatean fuzzy environment (generalization of fuzzy sets) with an optimization model based on deviation maximization method to determine partially known feature weights, combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets.

Result: The proposed method was successfully applied to renewable energy source selection problem, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling uncertainty and fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments.

Conclusion: The Fermatean fuzzy-based approach provides an effective framework for multi-criteria decision-making in uncertain environments, particularly valuable for renewable energy selection which has both technical and managerial/political implications.

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

*Yunzhe Wang,Volkan Ustun,Chris McGroarty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DECOY is a novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic planning in 3D terrains using high-level discretized simulation while preserving environmental fidelity, using CS:GO as a testbed with only movement decisions and neural models trained on real tournament data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern simulation environments need to balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency for complex multi-agent interactions, requiring tools that can accurately simulate strategic planning without modeling low-level mechanics.

Method: Uses a waypoint system to discretize continuous states and actions, paired with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament data to reconstruct event outcomes without explicit aiming/shooting modeling.

Result: Extensive evaluations show that replays generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original game, demonstrating accurate simulation of gameplay.

Conclusion: DECOY provides a valuable publicly available simulation environment for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior generation with computational efficiency and fidelity.

Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must
balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a
novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in
3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level
environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a
testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement
decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level
mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint
system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired
with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament
data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays
generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original
game. Our publicly available simulation environment provides a valuable tool
for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior
generation.

*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spectral NSR is a neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that uses graph spectral processing to embed logical rules as spectral templates, achieving superior accuracy, speed, and interpretability compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between symbolic reasoning's interpretability and neural networks' scalability by leveraging graph signal processing in the spectral domain.

Method: Embeds logical rules as spectral templates using graph Laplacian eigenstructure, with extensions including dynamic graph learning, frequency-selective filters, mixture-of-spectral-experts, proof-guided training, and uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning benchmarks (ProofWriter, CLUTRR) with superior accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness, and higher interpretability compared to transformers, MPNNs, and neuro-symbolic systems.

Conclusion: Spectral NSR provides a scalable, principled foundation for next-generation reasoning systems with transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

### [4] [Statistical Methods in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07054)
*Edgar Dobriban*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Statistical methods can improve reliability, quality, and efficiency of generative AI through verification, evaluation, and experimental design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI lacks default guarantees for correctness, safety, and fairness despite its transformative potential, requiring statistical approaches to enhance reliability.

Method: Review and analysis of existing statistical techniques for generative AI verification, quality evaluation, and experimental intervention design.

Result: Statistical methods offer promising approaches for providing reliability guarantees and improving AI system assessment.

Conclusion: Statistical techniques are crucial for addressing generative AI's reliability challenges, though limitations exist and future research directions are needed.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is emerging as an important technology,
promising to be transformative in many areas. At the same time, generative AI
techniques are based on sampling from probabilistic models, and by default,
they come with no guarantees about correctness, safety, fairness, or other
properties. Statistical methods offer a promising potential approach to improve
the reliability of generative AI techniques. In addition, statistical methods
are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation,
as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI.
  In this paper, we review some of the existing work on these topics,
explaining both the general statistical techniques used, as well as their
applications to generative AI. We also discuss limitations and potential future
directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Agent is a GUI agent that uses expert demonstrations to solve complex UI tasks by extracting step-by-step instructions and executing them precisely, achieving 60% success on challenging OSWorld tasks where other agents failed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions, and personalized trajectories, creating a need for more reliable automation.

Method: Leverages single expert demonstration to extract step-by-step instructions, executes strictly following intended trajectory, and uses verifier and backtracker modules for robustness against unexpected interruptions.

Result: Achieves 60% success rate on OSWorld tasks that all top-ranked agents failed to complete, demonstrating superior performance on challenging GUI automation tasks.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and extensible framework that bridges the gap between current GUI agents and reliable real-world GUI task automation through demonstration-based learning.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

### [6] [Neuro-Symbolic Frameworks: Conceptual Characterization and Empirical Comparative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07122)
*Sania Sinha,Tanawan Premsri,Danial Kamali,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of neurosymbolic frameworks focusing on DeepProbLog, Scallop, and DomiKnowS, highlighting their technical facets, expressivity, and challenges in declarative problem specification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neurosymbolic frameworks combine neural learning with symbolic reasoning for better explainability and data efficiency, but face challenges in usability and lack of unifying frameworks.

Method: Characterize technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks including symbolic representation language, neural integration, and algorithms, with focus on three generic frameworks.

Result: Identified key challenges and expressivity of each framework, providing foundation for understanding problem-solving capabilities in neurosymbolic modeling.

Conclusion: The analysis aims to spark transformative action and encourage rethinking neurosymbolic problem specification to advance the field with more user-friendly, declarative frameworks.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

### [7] [Autoencoder-Based Denoising of Muscle Artifacts in ECG to Preserve Skin Nerve Activity (SKNA) for Cognitive Stress Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07146)
*Farnoush Baghestani,Jihye Moon,Youngsun Kong,Ki Chon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deep learning-based denoising method using 1D convolutional autoencoder with LSTM bottleneck effectively removes EMG contamination from skin nerve activity (SKNA) recordings, enabling robust sympathetic nervous system monitoring in movement-rich environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin nerve activity (SKNA) from ECG provides noninvasive SNS monitoring but is highly susceptible to EMG contamination during muscle activity, limiting its practical use in naturalistic settings.

Method: A lightweight 1D convolutional autoencoder with LSTM bottleneck was trained on simulated EMG-contaminated SKNA data using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to reconstruct clean signals from noisy recordings.

Result: Method improved SNR by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross-correlation with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, restored burst features to near-clean discriminability (AUROC ≥ 0.96), and achieved 91-98% classification accuracy for stress detection.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based reconstruction effectively preserves physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during EMG interference, enabling robust SKNA monitoring in movement-rich environments comparable to clean data performance.

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

### [8] [PaVeRL-SQL: Text-to-SQL via Partial-Match Rewards and Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07159)
*Heng Hao,Wenjun Hu,Oxana Verkholyak,Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh,Baruch Gutow,Sima Didari,Masoud Faraki,Hankyu Moon,Seungjai Min*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaVeRL-SQL combines partial-match rewards and verbal reinforcement learning to improve Text-to-SQL models, achieving state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks with 7.4% higher execution accuracy on industrial databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL methods struggle with low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic, limiting practical deployment.

Method: Two pipelines: (1) in-context learning with group self-evaluation using LLMs as backbones, and (2) chain-of-thought RL with OmniSQL-7B trained with specialized reward function and two-stage RL. Uses partial-match rewards and verbal reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves SOTA on Spider, Spider 2.0, and BIRD benchmarks. 7.4% higher execution accuracy than SOTA on Spider2.0-SQLite, with threefold gains for SQL dialects with limited training data.

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL delivers reliable, state-of-the-art Text-to-SQL performance under realistic industrial constraints, significantly improving execution accuracy for complex databases and questions.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at

*Quinten Steenhuis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FETCH classifier for legal issue classification using hybrid LLM/ML ensemble and automatic follow-up questions achieves 97.37% accuracy at lower cost than GPT-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millions seeking legal help need accurate problem identification to avoid serious consequences like missed deadlines, abuse, housing loss, or custody issues from misdirection.

Method: Hybrid LLM/ML ensemble classification with automatic generation of follow-up questions to enrich initial problem narratives, tested on 419 real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service.

Result: Achieved classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37% using inexpensive models, exceeding GPT-5 performance.

Conclusion: The approach significantly reduces cost while maintaining high accuracy in guiding legal system users to appropriate resources.

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

*Abdulhakim Alsaiari,Mohammad Ilyas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid CNN-LSTM model achieves 99.70% accuracy for smart grid intrusion detection using DNP3 and IEC104 protocols


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart grid evolution increases vulnerability to cyber attacks like unauthorized access and DoS, requiring improved security for SCADA-based protocols

Method: Combines CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for temporal pattern recognition to create hybrid deep learning IDS trained on DNP3 and IEC104 datasets

Result: Achieves 99.70% detection accuracy with significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to other deep learning approaches

Conclusion: The proposed CNN-LSTM hybrid model effectively enhances smart grid cybersecurity by accurately detecting and classifying cyber threats

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Conclusion: BlendedNet successfully addresses the data scarcity problem for unconventional aircraft configurations and provides a foundation for data-driven surrogate modeling in aerodynamic design research.

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SLMs can achieve LLM-level performance in healthcare prediction with better efficiency and privacy, though challenges remain in handling class imbalance and few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns and efficiency issues of cloud-based LLMs in healthcare by exploring lightweight Small Language Models that can run locally on mobile/wearable devices.

Method: Systematic evaluation of SLMs using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning approaches, with deployment on mobile devices to assess real-world efficiency and performance.

Result: SLMs achieve performance comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy preservation.

Conclusion: SLMs represent a promising solution for privacy-preserving healthcare monitoring despite current challenges with class imbalance and few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

### [14] [Performative Thinking? The Brittle Correlation Between CoT Length and Problem Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07339)
*Vardhan Palod,Karthik Valmeekam,Kaya Stechly,Subbarao Kambhampati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Intermediate token generation length does not reliably indicate problem difficulty; correlation with ground truth complexity is weak and mainly occurs when problems are close to training distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine whether intermediate token sequence length in language models reflects actual problem difficulty, challenging the prevailing assumption that longer reasoning traces indicate adaptive computation.

Method: Trained transformer models from scratch on derivational traces of A* search algorithm for maze problems, systematically evaluating on trivial and out-of-distribution problems to compare intermediate token length with verifiable ground truth complexity.

Result: Models produced excessively long reasoning traces even for simplest tasks, and intermediate token length only loosely correlated with actual A* trace length. Correlation appeared mainly when problems were close to training distribution, suggesting approximate recall rather than genuine adaptive computation.

Conclusion: Intermediate trace generation is not adaptive to problem difficulty; longer sequences should not be automatically interpreted as indicating thinking effort, as the effect arises from distributional similarity rather than computational complexity.

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

Motivation: To extend LLM-based code evolution beyond isolated kernels to full repository scale, targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers - a canonical NP-complete problem crucial for both theory and applications.

Method: Orchestrates LLM agents to evolve solver repositories with strict correctness guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving its own evolution policies and rules.

Result: Evolved solvers decisively outperformed human-designed winners of SAT Competition 2025, and surpassed both 2024 and 2025 champions on 2024 benchmarks.

Conclusion: SATLUTION successfully demonstrates that LLM-based code evolution can be scaled to full repository level and achieve superior performance compared to human experts in complex algorithmic domains like SAT solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

### [16] [Language Self-Play For Data-Free Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07414)
*Jakub Grudzien Kuba,Mengting Gu,Qi Ma,Yuandong Tian,Vijai Mohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning method called Language Self-Play (LSP) enables LLMs to improve without additional training data by having models compete against themselves in a game-theoretic framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM progress depends on ever-increasing amounts of training data, creating a fundamental bottleneck. The paper aims to remove this dependency by enabling models to improve through self-play rather than additional data.

Method: Language Self-Play (LSP) uses a game-theoretic framework where models play against themselves competitively. This self-play process allows stronger policies to emerge without external data.

Result: Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct show that pretrained models can enhance performance on challenging instruction-following tasks through self-play alone, outperforming data-driven baselines.

Conclusion: Self-play reinforcement learning provides an effective alternative to data-driven scaling, enabling LLMs to improve their capabilities without requiring additional training data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

*Qin Chen,Yuanyi Ren,Xiaojun Ma,Mugeng Liu,Han Shi,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SheetDesigner is a zero-shot framework using MLLMs for automated spreadsheet layout generation that outperforms baselines by 22.6% by combining rule and vision reflection strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual spreadsheet layout design is time-consuming and requires expertise, while existing automated layout models are ill-suited for spreadsheets as they overlook their discrete grid-based structure and neglect spreadsheet-specific semantics like data dependencies.

Method: SheetDesigner uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in a zero-shot, training-free framework that combines rule and vision reflection for component placement and content population, supported by a formalized task definition and evaluation protocol.

Result: SheetDesigner outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6% and demonstrates that MLLMs handle overlap and balance well through vision modality but struggle with alignment, requiring hybrid strategies.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combining rule and visual reflection strategies is effective for spreadsheet layout generation, with vision modality helping with overlap and balance while rules address alignment challenges.

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

*Riccardo DElia,Alberto Termine,Francesco Flammini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics framework combining DL with interpretability techniques for transportation logistics, maintaining causal reliability while improving scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between DL's predictive accuracy/scalability and loss of explainability/causal reliability in critical decision-making systems for transportation logistics.

Method: Hybrid approach synergizing Deep Learning with Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability, and Causal Machine Learning to create neural network models with semantically meaningful variables.

Result: Framework enables construction of neural network models that retain causal grounding and transparency of traditional System Dynamics models while operating on actionable variables.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the gap between black-box predictive models and critical decision support needs in complex cyber-physical systems enabled by industrial IoT.

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

*Minghui Li,Hao Zhang,Yechao Zhang,Wei Wan,Shengshan Hu,pei Xiaobing,Jing Wang*

TL;DR: Proposed an activations-guided prompt injection attack framework using Energy-based Model and MCMC sampling for gradient-free black-box attacks with superior cross-model transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box methods and poor transferability of black-box methods for Direct Prompt Injection attacks on LLMs.

Method: Construct Energy-based Model using surrogate model activations to evaluate prompt quality, then use token-level MCMC sampling to adaptively optimize adversarial prompts for gradient-free attacks.

Result: Achieved 49.6% attack success rate across five mainstream LLMs, 34.6% improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintained 36.6% ASR on unseen task scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong transferability and effectiveness, with interpretability analysis revealing correlation between activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting semantic patterns' role in vulnerability exploitation.

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

*Sascha Kaltenpoth,Oliver Müller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM ATLAS framework uses agency theory to address AI alignment problems in organizational LLM adoption by mitigating information asymmetries between adopters and black-box LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can generate harmful content due to misspecifications during adoption, and existing research doesn't address information asymmetries in organizational adoption processes.

Method: Conceptual literature analysis using organizational LLM adoption phases and agency theory as analytical concepts.

Result: Developed an extended literature analysis process for AI alignment methods and created the first LLM alignment problem-solution space.

Conclusion: LLM ATLAS provides a theoretical framework to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption by addressing information asymmetries through agency theory principles.

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

### [21] [DeepGraphLog for Layered Neurosymbolic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07665)
*Adem Kikaj,Giuseppe Marra,Floris Geerts,Robin Manhaeve,Luc De Raedt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepGraphLog is a neurosymbolic AI framework that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates, enabling flexible multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning on graph-structured data, overcoming limitations of existing frameworks like DeepProbLog.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neurosymbolic frameworks enforce a fixed neural-then-symbolic flow that restricts modeling complex dependencies in irregular data structures like graphs, limiting their applicability.

Method: Extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates, treats symbolic representations as graphs processable by GNNs, and allows arbitrary layering of neural and symbolic components.

Result: Effectively captures complex relational dependencies in planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN expressivity tasks, outperforming existing NeSy systems.

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog broadens neurosymbolic AI applicability to graph-structured domains, providing a more expressive and flexible framework for neural-symbolic integration.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

*Jipeng Li,Zeyu Gao,Yubin Qi,Hande Dong,Weijian Chen,Qiang Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FTR framework combines user feedback with enhanced decoding to improve LLM self-correction, avoiding error propagation while enabling deeper reasoning through multipath exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate incorrect content during inference, and existing self-correction methods suffer from unreliable error localization signals and limited reasoning depth due to next-token decoding constraints.

Method: Proposes Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR) that only regenerates responses upon negative user feedback, and Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding for systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through delayed sequence evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

Conclusion: The FTR framework effectively addresses limitations of current self-correction approaches by leveraging user feedback strategically and enabling deeper reasoning through multipath decoding, demonstrating superior performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RIMO is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on International Mathematical Olympiad problems, featuring two tracks: one with unique integer answers for deterministic grading, and another with proof problems decomposed into sub-problems for step-by-step reasoning evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from grading noise and potential bias due to heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and reliance on potentially flawed solutions.

Method: Created two-track benchmark: RIMO-N with 335 IMO problems rewritten to have single unique integer answers, and RIMO-P with 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions decomposed into sub-problems for automated grading.

Result: Testing ten frontier LLMs (including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash) showed sharp performance drop on RIMO compared to older benchmarks, revealing substantial gap in Olympiad-level reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: RIMO provides a challenging yet easy-to-evaluate benchmark that serves as a high-resolution yardstick for measuring and closing the profound reasoning gap in current LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

*Bo Yu,Zhixiu Hua,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A machine learning framework called BDPM was developed for Parkinson's disease classification using gut microbiota data, featuring innovative feature selection and hybrid modeling to address limitations of existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parkinson's disease has high misdiagnosis rates due to reliance on clinical rating scales. Gut microbiota shows promise as a biomarker, but current deep learning models often use single classifiers and overlook microbial correlations and temporal dynamics, requiring more robust feature extraction methods.

Method: Collected gut microbiota profiles from 39 Parkinson's patients and healthy spouses, developed RFRE (Random Forest with Recursive Feature Elimination) for feature selection incorporating ecological knowledge, and designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and spatial patterns in microbiome data.

Result: The paper proposes BDPM framework but does not report specific classification performance metrics in the abstract. The method identifies differentially abundant taxa and develops an interpretable feature selection approach.

Conclusion: BDPM represents an advanced machine learning approach for Parkinson's disease diagnosis using gut microbiota analysis, addressing key limitations of previous methods through ecological knowledge integration and comprehensive pattern capture in microbiome data.

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the complexity of life cycle assessment (LCA) for carbon footprint calculation due to opaque global supply chains and fragmented data, making environmental sustainability insights more accessible to consumers and policymakers.

Method: Combines LCA advances with publicly available databases and knowledge-augmented AI techniques (including retrieval-augmented generation) to estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products through an interactive chatbot interface.

Result: Developed a proof-of-concept system with live web demonstration that can handle arbitrary food items and follow-up questions, successfully making LCA insights accessible while highlighting limitations like database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations.

Conclusion: The methodology shows potential for delivering complex environmental impact assessments in accessible formats, though challenges remain with data reliability and AI interpretation accuracy in sustainability applications.

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

*João Paulo Nogueira,Wentao Sun,Alonso Silva,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR) uses a critic model to monitor confidence during reasoning, enabling adaptive early termination when confident or continued reasoning when uncertain, improving accuracy while reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning language models operate with fixed thinking budgets, but this doesn't adapt to problem difficulty. The paper aims to make reasoning more efficient and reliable by dynamically adjusting reasoning effort based on confidence levels.

Method: Proposes a generator/discriminator framework where a critic model periodically assesses reasoning confidence. If certainty threshold isn't met, reasoning continues; otherwise, it terminates early to save tokens.

Result: CGR improves baseline accuracy on AIME2024/2025 datasets while reducing token usage. Multi-seed evaluations show reduced variance and improved exam performance. Can eliminate millions of tokens with tunable certainty-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: Certainty is a powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. CGR makes reasoning models more adaptive, trustworthy, and resource-efficient, enabling practical deployment where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

TL;DR: Comparative study of vector-based vs graph-based RAG for educational QA, showing vector RAG is cost-effective for facts while graph RAG excels at thematic queries and corpus integrity, recommending dynamic routing framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs like ChatGPT provide outdated/fabricated information in classrooms, requiring reliable RAG solutions that account for pedagogical factors and practical deployment costs.

Method: Used EduScopeQA dataset (3,176 questions across subjects) to evaluate OpenAI Vector Search RAG vs GraphRAG on educational query types and systematically altered textbooks that contradict LLM knowledge.

Result: Vector RAG performs well as low-cost generalist for fact retrieval; GraphRAG Global excels at thematic queries; GraphRAG Local achieves highest accuracy with altered textbooks; dynamic branching framework boosts fidelity and efficiency.

Conclusion: Actionable guidelines for educators: use vector RAG for facts, graph RAG for thematic content, and implement dynamic query routing to optimize cost and performance in educational settings.

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Small-scale open-source LLMs can be enhanced to synthesize high-quality code instruction data through iterative self-distillation, reducing reliance on costly proprietary LLMs and achieving state-of-the-art code generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code LLMs rely on expensive proprietary LLMs for instruction data distillation, which incurs high costs. The paper explores using small-scale open-source LLMs as cost-effective alternatives for high-quality code instruction data synthesis.

Method: Proposes iterative self-distillation approach with multi-checkpoint sampling and multi-aspect scoring for initial data selection, plus gradient-based influence estimation for final data filtering. Uses enhanced small-scale LLMs to synthesize code instruction data for fine-tuning.

Result: Developed SCoder models from DeepSeek-Coder that achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: Small-scale LLMs can be transformed into powerful synthesizers through iterative self-distillation, reducing dependency on proprietary LLMs while maintaining high-quality code generation performance at lower costs.

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CP-Model-Zoo is a tutoring system that retrieves expert-written constraint programming models from a database based on natural language problem descriptions, making CP more accessible to non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constraint Programming (CP) has great problem-solving potential but is hindered by complex modeling languages and the expertise required to create good models, making it inaccessible to non-experts.

Method: The system retrieves the closest source code model from a database of expert-written models using natural language descriptions of combinatorial problems, eliminating the need for human data labeling.

Result: Experiments show excellent accuracy in retrieving correct models based on user-input descriptions simulated with different expertise levels.

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo successfully bridges the gap between non-experts and expert-level CP modeling by leveraging accumulated expert knowledge through automated retrieval systems.

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiPhO is the first benchmark for high school physics Olympiads that enables direct comparison between (M)LLMs and human contestants using official exam data and grading standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physics benchmarks lack systematic coverage of real-world physics competitions like Olympiads and don't allow direct performance comparison with human contestants.

Method: Compiled 13 latest Olympiad exams (2024-2025) with mixed modalities, adopted official marking schemes for fine-grained grading, and assigned medals based on official thresholds to compare models with human performance.

Result: Open-source MLLMs mostly remain at/below bronze level; open-source LLMs show progress with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs achieve 6-12 gold medals; most models still have significant gap from full marks.

Conclusion: Substantial performance gap exists between open-source models and top students, closed-source reasoning models show strong physical reasoning, and significant room for improvement remains. HiPhO provides a rigorous, human-aligned benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning.

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

### [32] [Probing the Preferences of a Language Model: Integrating Verbal and Behavioral Tests of AI Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07961)
*Valen Tagliabue,Leonard Dung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Experimental study measuring AI welfare through preference-behavior consistency in language models, finding correlations but uncertainty about true welfare measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop empirical methods for measuring welfare in language models by comparing stated preferences with behavioral choices in virtual environments.

Method: Used experimental paradigms comparing verbal reports of preferences with behavior in virtual navigation and conversation topic selection, testing effects of costs/rewards and consistency across semantically equivalent prompts using eudaimonic welfare scales.

Result: Found notable mutual support between measures with reliable correlations between stated preferences and behavior, though consistency varied across models and conditions, and responses weren't consistent across perturbations.

Conclusion: Preference satisfaction can serve as an empirically measurable welfare proxy in some AI systems, but uncertainty remains about true welfare measurement due to model variability and fundamental questions about AI cognitive states and welfare subjecthood.

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

### [33] [VISION: Robust and Interpretable Code Vulnerability Detection Leveraging Counterfactual Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18933)
*David Egea,Barproda Halder,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VISION is a framework that uses counterfactual training with LLMs to improve GNN-based vulnerability detection by reducing spurious correlations, achieving significant accuracy improvements from 51.8% to 97.8% on CWE-20 vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs for vulnerability detection suffer from training data imbalances and label noise, causing them to learn spurious correlations from superficial code similarities rather than genuine vulnerability patterns, leading to poor generalization on real-world data.

Method: A three-part framework: (1) generates counterfactual samples using LLM prompting to create minimally modified code with opposite labels, (2) trains GNN on paired counterfactual examples, and (3) uses graph-based interpretability to identify crucial vulnerability-relevant code statements.

Result: Significant performance improvements: overall accuracy increased from 51.8% to 97.8%, pairwise contrast accuracy from 4.5% to 95.8%, and worst-group accuracy from 0.7% to 85.5% on CWE-20 vulnerabilities. Also created CWE-20-CFA benchmark with 27,556 functions.

Conclusion: VISION effectively mitigates spurious learning in GNN-based vulnerability detection, enables more robust and generalizable performance, and advances transparent AI cybersecurity through interpretable visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

### [34] [Individualized and Interpretable Sleep Forecasting via a Two-Stage Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06974)
*Xueyi Wang,Elisabeth Wilhelm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for sleep quality prediction that outperforms baseline methods with RMSE of 0.216 for 1-day prediction, featuring domain adaptation and explainability analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being, and there's a need for accessible and reliable forecasting tools for preventive interventions in healthcare.

Method: Two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model combining multi-scale convolutional layers for spatial interactions, recurrent layers and attention for temporal dependencies, with domain adaptation strategy (training-time adaptation and source-free test-time adaptation for new users).

Result: Model consistently outperformed baseline approaches (LSTM, Informer, PatchTST, TimesNet) across various input and prediction window sizes. Best performance: 3-day input window with 1-day prediction window (RMSE 0.216). Good performance for longer horizons (0.257 RMSE for 3-day prediction).

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices, with practical utility for real-world applications.

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

TL;DR: GSTBench is the first systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-dataset transferability of graph self-supervised learning methods, revealing that most SSL methods struggle to generalize while GraphMAE shows consistent improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most graph SSL methods are developed and evaluated under single-dataset settings, leaving their cross-dataset transferability unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining for generalized intelligence.

Method: Conducted large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluated five representative SSL methods across diverse target graphs with standardized experimental setup that decouples confounding factors like model architecture and dataset characteristics.

Result: Most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some performing worse than random initialization. GraphMAE (masked autoencoder approach) consistently improved transfer performance.

Conclusion: The study provides insights to guide future research on transferable graph SSL and lays a solid foundation for the "pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning, with GraphMAE showing promising results.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A knowledge-guided cross-modal model that combines temporal traffic data with human knowledge text for improved traffic demand prediction


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic prediction models rely only on temporal data, ignoring valuable human knowledge and experience that significantly influence real-world traffic patterns

Method: KGCM model integrates structured temporal data with textual human knowledge, uses local/global adaptive graph networks and cross-modal fusion, with reasoning-based dynamic parameter optimization

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple traffic datasets, achieving accurate future traffic demand predictions

Conclusion: Incorporating human knowledge and experience through cross-modal learning significantly enhances traffic prediction accuracy and robustness

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring consistent deep learning model behavior across different hardware backends (CPU, GPU, compiled runtimes) where discrepancies can occur due to implementation differences and nondeterministic operations.

Method: Decouples experiments from code using YAML configuration, supports library and repository models, and employs a three-tier verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment, and task-level metrics across 672 checks.

Result: 72.0% of runs pass compatibility checks, with most discrepancies occurring under stricter thresholds. Detection models and compiled backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic post-processing. Deterministic adapters and selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant performance loss.

Conclusion: This is the first unified framework that systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning, providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across heterogeneous runtimes.

Abstract: This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,
and task-level metrics. Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance
settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active learning Kriging-HDMR surrogate model for high-dimensional reliability analysis that overcomes curse of dimensionality through composite low-dimensional sub-models and optimized sampling strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional surrogate models suffer from curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional reliability analysis, and existing HDMR approaches focus on optimization rather than reliability analysis which requires high accuracy in critical regions.

Method: Three-stage Kriging-HDMR framework: 1) single-variable sub-surrogate models, 2) identification of coupling-variable requirements, 3) construction of coupling-variable sub-surrogate models with optimized sampling using uncertainty variance, predicted mean, and distance metrics.

Result: Numerical experiments show the method achieves high computational efficiency while maintaining strong predictive accuracy for high-dimensional reliability problems.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning surrogate model effectively addresses high-dimensional reliability analysis challenges through composite low-dimensional approximations and optimized sampling without candidate pools.

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional
reliability problems.

*Zirui Li,Bin Yang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes NSATP method for public transport arrival time prediction that balances predictability and non-stationarity through two-stage approach: series stationarization and non-stationarity effect recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normalization methods for handling non-stationary time series in arrival time prediction may obscure useful characteristics inherent in non-stationarity (over-stationarization), degrading model performance.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Series stationarization to improve predictability, 2) Non-stationarity effect recovery using 2D extension of state-of-the-art methods to capture hidden periodicity and compensation module for over-stationarization by learning scaling/shifting factors from raw data.

Result: NSATP reduces RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses respectively compared to baseline methods, using 125 days of Dresden public transport data.

Conclusion: The proposed NSATP method effectively balances predictability and non-stationarity in multi-step arrival time prediction, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches while preserving useful non-stationary characteristics.

Abstract: Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

Motivation: Large language models struggle with interactive tool usage due to tool heterogeneity, interface issues, and the need for stable multi-round interactions in real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses asyncio-based asynchronous caller, decoupled tool/training architecture, observation markers from tool feedback, and a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow with reward layer supporting rule-based, model-judgment, and tool-verification signals.

Result: Achieved 0.486 test score on Natural Questions dataset with Qwen3-4B, surpassing Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO (0.473), and increased training throughput by 6.8x.

Conclusion: RLFactory provides a low-barrier, highly adaptable framework that effectively strengthens multi-round tool use capabilities of LLMs in practical applications.

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool
heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and
a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a
reward layer supporting rule-based, model-judgment, and tool-verification
signals. It reconstructs the MDP by introducing observation markers from tool
feedback, closing the loop among model, tools, and environment, and implements
a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow for dynamic policy optimization. On
Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, RLFactory achieves a 0.486 test score on the Natural
Questions (NQ) dataset, surpassing larger models trained with similar
techniques (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO at 0.473), and increases training

TL;DR: CARE is a novel decoding-time safety alignment framework that combines real-time safety monitoring, rollback mechanism, and introspection-based intervention to achieve better safety-quality trade-off for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoding-time interventions like Contrastive Decoding often force a severe trade-off between safety and response quality in LLM deployment.

Method: Integrates three components: (1) guard model for real-time safety monitoring, (2) rollback mechanism with token buffer for early correction, and (3) introspection-based intervention where the model generates self-reflective critiques to guide subsequent decoding.

Result: Achieves superior balance of safety, quality, and efficiency with low harmful response rate and minimal user experience disruption while maintaining high response quality.

Conclusion: CARE framework provides an effective solution for decoding-time safety alignment that overcomes the limitations of existing methods by enabling precise interventions, timely corrections, and effective self-correction.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

TL;DR: FediLoRA is a federated learning framework that addresses heterogeneous client resources and missing modalities in multimodal fine-tuning by using dimension-wise aggregation and layer-wise model editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are large and hard to deploy in decentralized settings. Existing federated LoRA methods assume uniform ranks and unimodal inputs, ignoring real-world challenges like heterogeneous client resources and missing multimodal data.

Method: Proposes FediLoRA with dimension-wise aggregation that reweights LoRA updates without information dilution, and lightweight layer-wise model editing to selectively incorporate global parameters for local repair.

Result: Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets show superior performance over baselines in both global and personalized settings, especially with modality incompleteness.

Conclusion: FediLoRA effectively handles heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities in federated multimodal fine-tuning, achieving better performance than existing methods.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

*Sima Najafzadehkhoei,George Vega Yon,Bernardo Modenesi,Derek S. Meyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning calibrator using bidirectional LSTM to map epidemic time series to SIR parameters, outperforming ABC in accuracy, speed, and predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding, requiring faster and more accurate methods than traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation.

Method: Three-layer bidirectional LSTM that ingests 60-day incidence data with population size and recovery rate, outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0. Uses composite loss with epidemiology-motivated consistency penalty.

Result: Achieved lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs 0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), tighter predictive intervals with near nominal coverage, and reduced calibration time from 77.4s to 2.35s per calibration.

Conclusion: The approach enables fast and practical calibration, reproducing epidemic curves more faithfully than ABC despite partial nonidentifiability of contact rate and transmission probability.

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

TL;DR: A novel DRL environment for FJSP using discrete event simulation with PPO-based scheduling model, improved state representation, and comprehensible reward function that outperforms traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL methods for Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem focus mainly on agent design while neglecting environment modeling, creating a gap in comprehensive DRL-based scheduling solutions.

Method: Developed a chronological DRL environment using discrete event simulation, implemented PPO-based end-to-end model, created short state representation with two variables, and designed machine scheduling area-based reward function.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark instances show improved performance over priority dispatching rules and competitive results compared to OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL, and PDR methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL environment and scheduling model effectively address FJSP with better performance than traditional approaches, demonstrating the importance of proper environment modeling in DRL scheduling solutions.

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

TL;DR: A novel neural network architecture using single-bit parameters (0 or 1) for all layers, achieving 32x memory reduction while maintaining performance equivalent to 32-bit models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address deployment challenges of large neural networks by reducing memory requirements and enhancing computational efficiency for practical deployment across various applications.

Method: Developed binary normalized layers (fully connected, convolutional, attention, etc.) that use only 0/1 parameters. Tested on image classification (convolutional+FC layers) and language modeling (transformer blocks with multi-head attention).

Result: Models with binary normalized layers achieve almost identical performance to equivalent 32-bit models while using 32 times less memory. No dedicated hardware required - can be implemented with 1-bit arrays on current computers.

Conclusion: Binary normalized layers enable large neural network deployment on simple, cheap hardware (mobile devices, CPUs) with dramatically reduced memory requirements, opening new possibilities for efficient model deployment.

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

*Vishal Rishi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A recursive extension to linear Probabilistic Adaptive Slow Feature Analysis (PASFA) is proposed for efficient MMSE estimation of slow features from observations in ARMA processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to develop efficient methods to infer states (slow features) from observations and models in probabilistic SFA approaches, as current Kalman filter methods cannot easily recover the original states that form useful representations.

Method: The proposed algorithm performs minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of states evolving according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model, using a recursive extension to linear PASFA.

Result: The proposed technique was evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness in estimating slow features.

Conclusion: The recursive extension provides an efficient method for state inference in probabilistic slow feature analysis, overcoming limitations of existing Kalman filter approaches in recovering original slow features.

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

### [47] [A Minimalist Bayesian Framework for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07030)
*Kaizheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A minimalist Bayesian framework that uses profile likelihood to eliminate nuisance parameters and handles constraints, with applications in bandit problems and optimization algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Bayesian methods require probabilistic models for all parameters, which can be restrictive when incorporating complex structural constraints in sequential decision-making.

Method: Introduces a minimalist Bayesian approach that places priors only on parameters of interest (e.g., optimum location) and eliminates nuisance parameters via profile likelihood. Develops MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS) algorithm as an instantiation.

Result: The framework accommodates structured problems including continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. Provides probabilistic interpretation of classical convex optimization methods. MINTS achieves near-optimal regret guarantees for multi-armed bandits.

Conclusion: The minimalist Bayesian framework offers a principled yet flexible approach for sequential decision-making that naturally handles constraints while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combines causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting for US macroeconomic indicators, revealing causal relationships and enabling accurate unemployment predictions with confidence intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand dynamic causal relationships between key macroeconomic indicators and develop robust forecasting methods that can inform economic policy decisions.

Method: Applied LPCMCI framework with Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) for causal discovery on quarterly data (1970-2021), then used Chronos framework (large language model) for zero-shot probabilistic forecasting of unemployment.

Result: Found unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP, limited connectivity of inflation suggesting latent factors, strong autoregressive dependence in unemployment. Achieved accurate 1-2 quarter ahead unemployment forecasts with 90% confidence intervals.

Conclusion: Combining causal structure learning with probabilistic language models provides valuable insights for economic policy and enhances forecasting robustness through uncertainty-aware predictions.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

TL;DR: This study compares CNN and vision transformer models for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI analysis to validate that models learn physically meaningful thermal features consistent with physics principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI deployment for PV monitoring faces interpretability barriers, as deep learning achieves high accuracy but lacks validation that model decisions align with thermal physics principles, creating deployment hesitancy in critical energy infrastructure.

Method: Systematic comparison of convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories.

Result: Swin Transformer achieves highest performance (94% binary accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis reveals models learn physically meaningful features like localized hotspots, linear thermal paths, and thermal boundaries. Performance varies significantly across fault types, with electrical faults achieving strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33).

Conclusion: The thermal physics-guided interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment barriers in renewable energy infrastructure by ensuring model decisions align with physical principles.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear layers dominate parameter count and computational cost in deep learning models, creating need for more efficient alternatives.

Method: Express high-dimensional mappings through trainable low-dimensional multivariate functions implemented as spline lookup tables, enabling fast computation with few multiplications.

Result: 6.0x FLOPs reduction in inference, 10x higher H100 throughput, 1.6-2.1x FLOPs reduction in CNNs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: lmKANs provide superior trade-off between capacity and inference cost, making them effective drop-in replacements for linear layers in various deep learning architectures.

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA
kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.

TL;DR: GyroBN is a Riemannian batch normalization framework for gyrogroups that extends Euclidean normalization to non-Euclidean manifolds with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean normalization layers are inadequate for data on manifolds, while many Riemannian manifolds in ML have gyro-structures that enable principled extensions to non-Euclidean domains.

Method: Introduces GyroBN with two key conditions (pseudo-reduction and gyroisometric gyrations) that guarantee theoretical control over sample statistics. Framework incorporates existing Riemannian normalization methods and is instantiated on seven geometries including Grassmannian, constant curvature spaces, and correlation manifold.

Result: Experiments across seven representative geometries demonstrate the effectiveness of GyroBN. The framework works for all known gyrogroups in machine learning.

Conclusion: GyroBN provides a principled Riemannian batch normalization framework with theoretical guarantees that extends to various non-Euclidean geometries, addressing the limitations of Euclidean normalization on manifold data.

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabGFM reformulates graph node classification as a tabular problem, using tabular foundation models for zero-shot learning via table conversion and ensemble selection, outperforming GNNs and GFMs on 28 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph foundation models are trained on datasets that poorly represent real-world graphs, limiting generalization. Tabular foundation models have shown strong cross-domain performance, suggesting a tabular reformulation approach could improve graph learning.

Method: Convert graphs to tables using feature and structural encoders, apply multiple tabular foundation models to diversely subsampled tables, and aggregate outputs through ensemble selection.

Result: TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and state-of-the-art graph foundation models across 28 real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Tabular reformulation shows significant potential for scalable and generalizable graph learning, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging tabular foundation models for graph tasks.

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EICS, a single-pass method to quantify when Transformer Circuits in LLMs are behaving coherently and trustworthy, combining sheaf inconsistency and causal emergence metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mechanistic interpretability lacks formal methods to quantify when identified functional subgraphs (Transformer Circuits) in LLMs are behaving coherently and trustworthy.

Method: Specializes sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspectives to Transformer Circuits, introducing Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS) that combines normalized sheaf inconsistency from local Jacobians/activations with Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence.

Result: The method is white-box, single-pass, makes units explicit (dimensionless score), and provides practical guidance on interpretation, computational overhead, and includes toy sanity-check analysis.

Conclusion: EICS offers a formal framework to assess circuit coherence in LLMs, though empirical validation on actual LLM tasks is deferred for future work.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

Motivation: To accelerate materials discovery by overcoming the slow and expensive trial-and-error process in developing new materials for applications like solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture.

Method: Fine-tuned Qwen-2.5 7B LLM with Wyckoff-based text representation for crystal generation, using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) reinforcement learning to guide outputs toward stable, novel structures with desired space group properties.

Result: Generates thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel structures at ~50% greater rate than prior methods, with ~115% improvement in unconditional generation and ~50% improvement in space group conditioned generation compared to fine-tuning alone.

Conclusion: Demonstrates successful adaptation of NLP post-training techniques to materials design, enabling targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials with desired properties.

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted

TL;DR: Fed-REACT is a federated learning framework that addresses data heterogeneity and evolution through representation learning and dynamic client clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome performance degradation in standard FL algorithms caused by heterogeneous and evolving client data distributions in real-world deployments.

Method: Two-stage process: (1) clients learn local models to extract feature representations, (2) server dynamically clusters clients based on representations and coordinates cluster-wise training for downstream tasks.

Result: Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets compared to standard FL approaches.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles data heterogeneity and evolution through representation learning and evolutionary clustering, providing both theoretical guarantees and empirical performance improvements.

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting drug efficacy prior to clinical testing has been challenging in pharmaceutical R&D, requiring better methods to assess untested pharmaceuticals

Method: Train ML model using pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data (characteristics + clinical outcomes), then analyze weighted impact scores of untested drugs across biological pathways

Result: Demonstrated on real-world dataset with patient treatments/outcomes using two different weight impact score algorithms, with evaluation methods for generalization performance

Conclusion: Provides a flexible, modular framework that can be iterated upon for predicting effects of untested drugs using real-world clinical data and drug embeddings

Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in
treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use
has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine
learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested
pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using
sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can
include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting
model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across
human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach
can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on
predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug
embeddings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PTQ exacerbates disparate impacts on minority groups due to quantization effects on weights/activations, causing lower logit variance and increased loss. Proposed solution integrates mixed precision QAT with dataset sampling and weighted loss for fair quantized networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely used for compression but was observed to disproportionately harm minority group accuracy, creating fairness issues in quantized neural networks.

Method: Analyzed quantization's chain effects on forward/backward passes, studied impacts on gradient norms and Hessian eigenvalues. Proposed mixed precision Quantization Aware Training combined with dataset sampling and weighted loss functions.

Result: Quantization causes cascaded impacts leading to lower logit variance, increased loss, and compromised group accuracies, particularly affecting minority groups disproportionately.

Conclusion: Integrating mixed precision QAT with fairness-aware techniques (dataset sampling and weighted loss) can mitigate disparate impacts and enable fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IP-Basis PINNs is a meta-learning framework that enables efficient multi-query inverse problem solving by training a basis network offline and using only a lightweight linear layer online for rapid inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are computationally expensive for multi-query inverse problems as each new observed dataset requires full retraining.

Method: Offline-online decomposition: train deep network offline to produce basis functions spanning parametric differential equation solutions, then freeze network and train only linear output layer online for each new inverse problem with novel loss formulation and forward-mode automatic differentiation.

Result: Demonstrated on three benchmarks including universal PINNs for unknown functionals - shows consistent performance across constant/functional parameter estimation, significant speedup per query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce/noisy data.

Conclusion: IP-Basis PINNs provide an efficient framework for rapid inverse problem solving with reduced computational overhead while maintaining robustness to data scarcity and noise.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is
computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of
observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient conflict resolution methods like PCGrad, CAGrad, and GradNorm are computationally demanding, limiting their application in modern large models and transformers.

Method: Gradient Conductor (GCond) builds on PCGrad principles with gradient accumulation and adaptive arbitration mechanism, evaluated on self-supervised learning tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures.

Result: GCond achieved two-fold computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, demonstrated superior performance with lower L1 and SSIM losses, and showed high scalability across compact and large models.

Conclusion: GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to gradient conflicts in multi-task learning, compatible with modern optimizers like AdamW and Lion/LARS.

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

*Luke McLennan,Yi Wang,Ryan Farell,Minh Nguyen,Chandrajit Bajaj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust unsupervised framework for learning generalized Hamiltonian dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data using variational Bayesian inference and physics-constrained regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Hamiltonian network models struggle to capture distinctive motion dynamics of conservative, dissipative, and port-Hamiltonian systems from observational data, despite sharing initial energy characteristics.

Method: Extends sparse symplectic random Fourier Gaussian processes with predictive Hamiltonian landscape estimation, using kernelized ELBO loss plus stability and conservation constraints as regularization terms.

Result: The framework enables accurate prediction of various Hamiltonian dynamics with bounded uncertainty by enforcing physics correctness through multi-gradient regularization.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the complex Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge by combining Bayesian inference with physics-informed constraints for robust generalized Hamiltonian system modeling.

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study neural network generalization in combinatorially complex domains using cryptogram solving as a testbed, where models must choose from 26! possible substitution mappings.

Method: Developed ALICE - an encoder-only Transformer with a novel bijective decoding head using Gumbel-Sinkhorn method to explicitly model permutations and enable direct extraction of learned cipher mappings.

Result: ALICE sets new state-of-the-art for accuracy and speed, generalizing to unseen ciphers after training on only ~1500 unique ciphers (3.7×10⁻²⁴ of possible space). Early exit analysis reveals progressive refinement mirroring human strategies.

Conclusion: The architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure, offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating complex patient presentations into guideline-compliant cancer treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires specialized expertise, and is prone to error. LLMs promise to reduce time and improve accuracy.

Method: Developed hybrid approach combining human annotations with model consistency information. Created LLM agent framework to predict relevant guidelines and meta-classifier for verification with confidence scores. Used novel longitudinal dataset of 121 NSCLC cases with expert annotations.

Result: Achieved strong correlation with expert benchmarks (Spearman r=0.88, RMSE=0.08). Meta-classifier achieved AUROC=0.800 for treatment recommendation accuracy verification. Demonstrated high-quality proxy benchmark generation capability.

Conclusion: Establishes clinically viable LLM-based guideline adherence system framework that balances accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing scalable pathway for automated clinical decision support.

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based
guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into
guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires
specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model
(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment
recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to
automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GDP is a pre-trained model that learns better representations of age and gender demographic attributes, improving predictive performance in healthcare applications across diverse populations and diseases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demographic attributes like age and gender are crucial predictors in healthcare but are often treated as auxiliary features with limited representation learning attention.

Method: Proposes General Demographic Pre-trained (GDP) model that explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings, pre-trained on diverse datasets.

Result: Sequential ordering substantially improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and information gain. GDP enhances representational importance even when demographic attributes have low predictive value.

Conclusion: Foundational models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and populations, offering promising direction for improving healthcare predictive performance.

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedTeddi is a scheduling algorithm for federated edge learning that addresses dynamic data evolution by quantifying temporal drift and non-i.i.d. characteristics using Earth Mover's Distance, enabling faster convergence under communication constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world federated learning scenarios involve clients with continuously evolving, time-varying, non-i.i.d. data, requiring adaptive model training that existing static dataset assumptions don't address.

Method: Proposes FedTeddi algorithm that quantifies temporal dynamics using temporal drift and collective divergence (measured as EMD of class distributions), with joint scheduling and bandwidth allocation optimization.

Result: Achieves 58.4% faster convergence on CIFAR-10 and 49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling, with higher test accuracy and faster convergence than benchmarks.

Conclusion: FedTeddi effectively handles dynamic data evolution in FEEL by considering temporal drift and divergence, enabling quick adaptation to new data while preserving previous knowledge under resource constraints.

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While
most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SBS enhances neural representation for neural networks by suppressing spectral bias using unidirectional ordering-based smoothing and adaptive random Fourier features, achieving better parameter compression and reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MLPs in neural representation for neural networks suffer from spectral bias, limiting their ability to reconstruct high-frequency details effectively in parameter compression.

Method: Proposes two techniques: (1) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing to improve kernel smoothness, and (2) adaptive random Fourier features that modulate frequency bandwidth based on layer-wise parameter count.

Result: Extensive evaluations on ResNet models with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show significantly better reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SBS provides a parameter-efficient enhancement that effectively suppresses spectral bias in neural network weight representations, enabling superior compression and reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

Motivation: Existing outlier-robust filters need better capabilities to handle correlated measurement noise and learn outlier characteristics dynamically during operation.

Method: Enhanced version of EM-based outlier robust filter (EMORF) with additional learning features for outlier characteristics during inference and outlier-detection capabilities.

Conclusion: EMORF-II provides improved outlier-mitigation capability while maintaining computational complexity on par with other practical methods, making it suitable for diverse applications.

Abstract: We present a learning-based outlier-robust filter for a general setup where
the measurement noise can be correlated. Since it is an enhanced version of

equipped with an additional powerful feature to learn the outlier
characteristics during inference along with outlier-detection, EMORF-II has
improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm
performance gains as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPH-RL uses mass-covering f-divergences to preserve diversity during RL fine-tuning, preventing Pass@k degradation while improving both single and multi-attempt performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR methods suffer from multi-attempt performance degradation and catastrophic forgetting despite improving single-attempt accuracy, due to improper divergence term usage.

Method: Proposes DPH-RL framework using mass-covering f-divergences (forward-KL, JS-divergence) as rehearsal mechanism by continuously referencing initial policy to maintain solution diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on math and SQL generation show DPH-RL resolves Pass@k degradation, improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in/out-of-domain, and is more training-efficient.

Conclusion: Proper divergence measure selection is crucial for RLVR improvement, serving as powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for recommendation systems that jointly learns from explicit ratings and implicit feedback, providing separate predictions for consumption probability and rating likelihood while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve user modeling and recommendation by creating a flexible model that can learn associations between different interaction types, handle both explicit and implicit feedback simultaneously, and provide more informative predictions about what users would enjoy if exposed to content.

Method: Convolutional AutoEncoder architecture that learns jointly from explicit ratings and implicit sampling patterns, with separate prediction heads for consumption probability and rating likelihood, supported by theoretical generalization bounds.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks using a single model, with additional interpretability through individual probability predictions for each possible rating.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully handles multiple feedback types in a unified framework, provides interpretable predictions, and demonstrates strong empirical performance while being theoretically grounded with generalization guarantees.

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art

*Adithya Ramachandran,Thorkil Flensmark B. Neergaard,Tomás Arias-Vergara,Andreas Maier,Siming Bayer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel water demand forecasting method using unsupervised contrastive learning to categorize consumers by behavior patterns, then using wavelet-transformed convolutional networks with cross-attention for improved short-term predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Water demand forecasting is challenging due to non-deterministic factors like weather, and securing water resources is urgent due to climate change. Smart metering provides hourly consumption data but needs better methods to handle diverse consumption patterns.

Method: Unsupervised contrastive learning to categorize end-users by consumption behaviors, then wavelet-transformed convolutional networks with cross-attention mechanism combining historical data and behavioral representations for forecasting.

Result: Evaluated on real-world DMAs over 6 months, achieved up to 4.9% improvement in MAPE across different DMAs, and identified consumers influenced by socioeconomic factors.

Conclusion: The approach improves water demand forecasting accuracy and provides insights into consumption behaviors influenced by socioeconomic factors, enhancing understanding of demand patterns.

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CDL methods face challenges in detecting rare events due to high computational costs and sensitivity to artifacts/outliers, limiting their practical application for anomaly detection in large-scale signals.

Method: Combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate anomalous patterns.

Result: Reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

Conclusion: RoseCDL enables effective unsupervised rare event detection in long signals, making CDL more applicable for real-world signal analysis across various scientific domains.

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

*Zhiyuan He,Xufang Luo,Yike Zhang,Yuqing Yang,Lili Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Delta L Normalization is a loss aggregation method that addresses high gradient variance from variable response lengths in RLVR training, providing unbiased estimates with minimal variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR shows promise for improving LLM reasoning but suffers from unstable optimization due to large variability in response lengths during training, causing high gradient variance that previous methods fail to adequately address.

Method: Theoretical and empirical analysis of length effects on policy loss, reformulating as minimum-variance unbiased estimator problem. Delta L Normalization provides unbiased policy loss estimates while minimizing gradient variance.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent superior performance across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks compared to previous methods like GRPO, DAPO, and Dr. GRPO.

Conclusion: Delta L Normalization effectively solves the length variability problem in RLVR training, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical improvements for stable optimization and enhanced reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

TL;DR: A novel neural network architecture called uGMM-NN that embeds probabilistic Gaussian mixture models directly into neurons, enabling multimodal uncertainty-aware representations while maintaining scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate probabilistic reasoning directly into neural network units, enabling richer representations that capture multimodality and uncertainty at the neuron level, rather than using traditional fixed nonlinearities.

Method: Each neuron parameterizes activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients, replacing traditional weighted sums and fixed nonlinearities while retaining feedforward network scalability.

Result: uGMM-NN achieves competitive discriminative performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons while providing probabilistic interpretation of activations and uncertainty-aware components.

Conclusion: The framework provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware probabilistic components into modern neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and generative modeling.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network
(uGMM-NN), a novel neural architecture that embeds probabilistic reasoning
directly into the computational units of deep networks. Unlike traditional
neurons, which apply weighted sums followed by fixed nonlinearities, each
uGMM-NN node parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture,
with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients. This design enables
richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework
provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern
neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dual formulation for PINNs improves reliability in homogenizing periodic thermo-conductive composites with discontinuous coefficients, providing error bounds and failure detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients like piecewise constant properties, requiring more robust methods for homogenization problems.

Method: Introduces dual formulation for PINN framework, compares standard PINNs with smoothed approximations vs variational PINNs (VPINNs) using spectral and neural network test functions.

Result: Strong-form PINNs outperform VPINNs in controlled settings but are sensitive to material discontinuities. VPINNs handle piecewise constants directly but need careful test function selection. Dual formulation provides reliable convergence indicators.

Conclusion: Integration of dual formulation into PINN frameworks enhances applicability to homogenization problems in micromechanics by providing guaranteed error bounds and robust failure detection.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Conclusion: Attention-based deep learning effectively optimizes sensor placement for proactive maintenance, enhancing operational reliability and yield in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy
for optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring
of semiconductor probe cards. Failures in probe cards, including substrate
cracks and loosened screws, would critically affect semiconductor manufacturing
yield and reliability. Some failure modes could be detected by equipping a
probe card with adequate sensors. Frequency response functions from simulated
failure scenarios are adopted within a finite element model of a probe card. A
comprehensive dataset, enriched by physics-informed scenario expansion and
physics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid
Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high
accuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose
screw, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model
robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints
critical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers
actionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems
by optimizing sensor configurations. This research highlights the capability of
attention-based deep learning to advance proactive maintenance, enhancing

*Ali Nawaz,Amir Ahmad,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evaluation of binary classifiers' performance under class imbalance without rebalancing techniques, showing TabPFN and boosting ensembles maintain better performance in extreme imbalance scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance is a major challenge in supervised classification, especially in critical domains like medical diagnostics, but most research focuses on rebalancing techniques rather than evaluating classifiers' native performance under imbalance.

Method: Systematic evaluation of diverse binary classifiers across real-world and synthetic datasets with progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot/few-shot baselines. Includes experiments with undersampling, oversampling, and one-class classification methods under severe imbalance.

Result: Classification difficulty increases with data complexity and minority class size reduction. Traditional classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, while advanced models like TabPFN and boosting-based ensembles maintain relatively higher performance and better generalization.

Conclusion: Provides valuable guidance for model selection in imbalanced learning, demonstrating that certain advanced classifiers can maintain robustness without explicit rebalancing techniques.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Integrated Gradients assumes continuous data and is ill-suited for discrete graph structures, creating a need for a graph-specific explainability method.

Method: Developed graph-based integrated gradients (GB-IG) as an extension of IG specifically designed for graph data structures.

Result: GB-IG accurately identified crucial structural components in synthetic datasets and outperformed IG on real-world graph datasets for node classification tasks.

Conclusion: GB-IG provides an effective explainability technique for graph neural networks, successfully addressing the limitations of standard IG when applied to discrete graph data.

Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG) is a common explainability technique to address the
black-box problem of neural networks. Integrated gradients assumes continuous
data. Graphs are discrete structures making IG ill-suited to graphs. In this
work, we introduce graph-based integrated gradients (GB-IG); an extension of IG
to graphs. We demonstrate on four synthetic datasets that GB-IG accurately
identifies crucial structural components of the graph used in classification
tasks. We further demonstrate on three prevalent real-world graph datasets that
GB-IG outperforms IG in highlighting important features for node classification
tasks.

*Pierre Lambert,Edouard Couplet,Michel Verleysen,John Aldo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel neighbor embedding method that bridges the gap between coarse approximations (fast but low quality) and precise methods (slow but high quality), enabling interactive data exploration with instant visual feedback and no dimensionality restrictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between speed and quality in neighbor embeddings - current methods either sacrifice structure preservation for speed (UMAP) or are too slow for interactive use while limiting dimensionality to 2-3 (t-SNE variants).

Method: Proposes a new acceleration technique requiring few computations per iteration while maintaining structure quality, featuring a novel iterative approximate nearest neighbor search approach and abandoning the traditional two-phase approach for instant hyperparameter feedback.

Result: The method shows promising results in speed and flexibility, enabling interactive data exploration with instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters, even for high-dimensional processes.

Conclusion: This approach successfully bridges the gap between fast coarse approximations and slow precise methods, offering both speed and quality while removing dimensionality restrictions, with potential applications in broader machine learning contexts.

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBN proposes an interpretable bidirectional network for multivariate time series forecasting with missing variables, using uncertainty-aware interpolation and Gaussian graph convolution to improve reliability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like GinAR lack interpretability and fail to capture latent temporal patterns when handling missing variables in multivariate time series forecasting.

Method: Integrates Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) with MC Dropout for uncertainty estimation, Gaussian kernel-based Graph Convolution (GGCN) for spatial correlations, and bidirectional recursive units for temporal dependency modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing more reliable and interpretable results.

Conclusion: IBN offers a superior framework for multivariate time series forecasting with missing variables through its interpretable bidirectional modeling approach.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

TL;DR: Proposes using error-bounded lossy compression to reduce data transfer overhead for MoE models by compressing non-activated experts, with analysis showing varying impact on inference accuracy across different model layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently serving Mixture of Experts models under limited GPU memory constraints by offloading non-activated experts to main memory, while addressing the challenge of data transfer overhead through compression.

Method: Employ error-bounded lossy compression algorithms (SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts and conduct extensive experiments to analyze how compression-induced errors affect inference accuracy across different expert layers.

Result: Shallow-layer experts (attention mechanism, token transformation) show minimal accuracy degradation; middle-layer experts (model reasoning) significantly impair accuracy; deep-layer experts (instruction following, output integration) can sometimes improve accuracy with bounded errors.

Conclusion: Error-bounded compression is effective for reducing MoE model serving overhead, with layer-specific error tolerance that can guide selective compression strategies to maintain or even improve inference performance.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combining unstructured crash narratives with structured data using NLP techniques (TF-IDF and Word2Vec) significantly improves injury severity prediction accuracy in traffic crashes, with TF-IDF + XGBoost performing best across various road classification schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance road safety and emergency response by improving injury severity prediction in traffic crashes through the integration of unstructured police narratives with traditional structured crash data.

Method: Used TF-IDF and Word2Vec NLP techniques to extract semantic meaning from crash narratives, applied K-NN oversampling for class imbalance, and developed 102 ML models combining structured and narrative features using XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost across three road classification schemes.

Result: Models incorporating narrative data consistently outperformed structured-data-only models. TF-IDF with XGBoost yielded the most accurate predictions across most road classification subgroups.

Conclusion: Integrating textual crash narratives with structured data provides a powerful framework for improving injury severity prediction, offering transportation professionals practical tools for enhanced safety modeling and policy decisions.

Abstract: Predicting injuries and fatalities in traffic crashes plays a critical role
in enhancing road safety, improving emergency response, and guiding public
health interventions. This study investigates the added value of unstructured
crash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with
structured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the
narratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of
class imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to
the training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from
Kentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three
road classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes
(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four
broader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and
(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning
models were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based
features using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:
XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models
incorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on
structured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded
the most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the
power of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance
person-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable
framework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity
modeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures.

Method: Leverages pretrained deep learning model on historical drug response data to generate drug combination embeddings and dose-level importance scores, combining clustering for functional diversity with dose-weighting for historical informativeness.

Result: Retrospective simulations on large-scale datasets show substantial improvement in initial screening efficiency compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Provides a viable path for more effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens by addressing the cold-start problem through principled experiment selection.

Abstract: Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains
largely infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in
patient-derived models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the
number of feasible experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window
makes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a
means of guiding drug response prediction. This leads to a challenging
cold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test
early, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a
strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical
drug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations
and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial
experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug
combination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial
screening efficiency compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more
effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens.

TL;DR: Multi-omics SVR model combining radiomics and dosiomics features predicts GTV changes in PULSAR radiotherapy with high accuracy (R²=0.743).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes has substantial prognostic value for personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR) treatment.

Method: Developed support vector regression (SVR) models using radiomics (MRI) and dosiomics (dose maps) features from 39 patients with 69 brain metastases. Used delta features to capture changes between time points, LASSO for feature selection, and 5-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats.

Result: Multi-omics models integrating radiomics, dosiomics, and delta features outperformed individual-omics models. Top model achieved R²=0.743 and RRMSE=0.022. Delta-radiomic features significantly enhanced prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The multi-omics SVR model shows promising performance for predicting continuous GTV changes, providing a quantitative and personalized approach for patient selection and treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR)
is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals.
Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression
models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a
multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV
change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was
analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.
Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time
points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking
criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using
the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error
(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate
the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,
dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.
Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy
relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves
an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows
promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a
more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and
treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

TL;DR: In-ear EEG signals can achieve 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection and 65.1% for four-class sleep staging, demonstrating feasibility for unobtrusive wearable sleep monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EEG sleep monitoring is accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use. There's a need for comfortable, wearable solutions for real-world sleep monitoring applications like automatically pausing media when users fall asleep.

Method: Conducted sleep study with 11 participants using custom earpiece with dry eartip electrode in one ear and reference in the other. Used single-channel in-ear ExG signals and validated ground truth from Apple Watch Ultra. Employed leave-one-subject-out validation.

Result: Achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep).

Conclusion: In-ear electrodes show promise as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep monitoring, enabling practical applications like automatic media control when users fall asleep.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which
are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep
laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home
environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep
onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.
automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent
research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for
various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive
sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel
in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a
wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:
24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse)
as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground
truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep
staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake
vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the
potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep
monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

TL;DR: Novel modular algorithm for Online Convex-Concave Optimization achieves minimax optimal dynamic duality gap bounds through adaptive components and multi-predictor aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal performance in Online Convex-Concave Optimization, particularly in stationary or predictable environments, requiring better methods to minimize the dynamic duality gap.

Method: Proposes a modular algorithm with three components: Adaptive Module for dynamic adjustment to non-stationarity, Multi-Predictor Aggregator to identify best predictors, and Integration Module that combines their strengths.

Result: Achieves minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound (up to logarithmic factor) and ensures prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds. Empirical results demonstrate effectiveness and adaptability.

Conclusion: The modular design enables optimal performance in varying environments and allows seamless integration of side knowledge from multiple predictors, providing a flexible and effective solution for two-player convex-concave games.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Online Convex-Concave Optimization,
which extends Online Convex Optimization to two-player time-varying
convex-concave games. The goal is to minimize the dynamic duality gap (D-DGap),
a critical performance measure that evaluates players' strategies against
arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal
performance, particularly in stationary or predictable environments. To address
this, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an
Adaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,
a Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple
candidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their
strengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a
logarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.
The modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that
regulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of
components that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.
Empirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed method.

TL;DR: Inverse problems can efficiently uncover scaling laws for LLMs, enabling better cost-effectiveness in model building.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High training costs make brute-force trial-and-error approaches infeasible for improving LLMs, so more efficient methods are needed.

Method: Applying inverse problem techniques inspired by scientific discovery to uncover scaling laws that guide LLM development.

Result: Proposes that inverse problems can reveal fundamental scaling principles for building performant LLMs more efficiently.

Conclusion: Inverse problem approaches offer a promising alternative to costly trial-and-error methods for discovering optimal scaling laws in LLM development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleZero extends UniZero with Mixture-of-Experts architecture and dynamic parameter scaling to handle large-scale heterogeneous multi-task learning efficiently, achieving performance comparable to specialized single-task models with 80% fewer environment steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-task world models struggle with gradient conflicts and loss of plasticity in heterogeneous environments with diverse observation/action spaces and varying task difficulties, limiting their sample and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes ScaleZero with MoE architecture to mitigate gradient conflicts, plus online LoRA-based dynamic parameter scaling (DPS) that progressively integrates adapters based on task-specific progress for adaptive knowledge retention and parameter expansion.

Result: Achieves performance on par with specialized single-task baselines on Atari, DMControl, and Jericho benchmarks using only online RL with one model, and requires only 80% of single-task environment interaction steps when augmented with DPS.

Conclusion: ScaleZero demonstrates strong potential for effective large-scale multi-task learning by addressing gradient conflicts and computational load balancing through architectural improvements and dynamic parameter management.

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data that hinder deployment of multi-modal multi-task foundation models in real-world educational settings.

Method: Integration of federated learning with M3T foundation models to enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized educational institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks.

Result: Proposes a framework that advances three critical pillars: privacy preservation (keeping sensitive data local), personalization (modular architectures for tailored models), and equity/inclusivity (facilitating participation from underrepresented entities).

Conclusion: M3T FedFMs represent a promising approach for education, but several research challenges need addressing including heterogeneous privacy regulations, non-uniform data modalities, unlearning approaches, continual learning frameworks, and model interpretability for practical deployment.

Abstract: Multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models (FMs) have recently shown
transformative potential in artificial intelligence, with emerging applications
in education. However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is
hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data
availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for
education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to
enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized
institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently,
this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored
approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its
related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three
critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy
preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research
challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy
regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning
frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must
be collectively addressed for practical deployment.

TL;DR: ACE method addresses complete spurious correlations in neural networks using self-training with confident selective disagreement, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks and showing promise for language-model alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are sensitive to spurious correlations that fail out-of-distribution, particularly when correlations are complete and correct generalization is fundamentally underspecified.

Method: Proposes learning concepts consistent with training data but making distinct predictions on novel unlabeled inputs using self-training approach that encourages confident and selective disagreement.

Result: ACE matches or outperforms existing methods on complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, remains robust to incomplete spurious correlations, and achieves competitive performance on measurement tampering detection without access to untrusted measurements.

Conclusion: ACE represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification in neural networks, though still subject to important limitations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

TL;DR: New attention scoring functions using Block Tensor-Train and Multi-Level Low Rank matrices address information loss and locality issues in standard attention, outperforming it on high-dimensional tasks and language modeling with improved scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard attention suffers from information loss due to low-dimensional projections and lacks distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring tokens, limiting performance on tasks with high-dimensional inputs and locality patterns.

Method: Proposed new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured matrices (Block Tensor-Train and Multi-Level Low Rank matrices) that maintain high ranks and can encode distance-dependent compute biases.

Result: Outperforms standard attention on high-dimensional in-context regression tasks for any fixed compute budget, achieves improved scaling laws in language modeling compared to standard and sliding window attention, and shows promising results for long-range time-series forecasting.

Conclusion: The proposed structured matrix-based attention methods effectively address key limitations of standard attention, offering both full-rank capabilities and distance-dependent biases while maintaining computational efficiency across various tasks.

Abstract: The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the
inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each
pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes
information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional
inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input
pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring
tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by
proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured
matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level
Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional
inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any
fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality
patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws
compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of
efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or
distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings
of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising
results for long-range time-series forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread practical success of learning rate warmup in training large neural networks, there has been a gap in theoretical understanding of why this strategy works and what advantages it provides.

Method: Proposed a novel family of generalized smoothness assumptions, validated both theoretically and empirically. Studied convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) with warmup in deterministic and stochastic settings under these assumptions.

Result: Learning rate warmup consistently accelerates GD convergence. In specific cases, GD with warmup can converge Θ(T) times faster than with non-increasing learning rate schedules.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights into the benefits of learning rate warmup from an optimization theory perspective, bridging the gap between practice and theory for this widely used technique.

Abstract: Learning rate warmup is a popular and practical technique in training
large-scale deep neural networks. Despite the huge success in practice, the
theoretical advantages of this strategy of gradually increasing the learning
rate at the beginning of the training process have not been fully understood.
To resolve this gap between theory and practice, we first propose a novel
family of generalized smoothness assumptions, and validate its applicability
both theoretically and empirically. Under the novel smoothness assumption, we
study the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. It is shown that learning rate warmup consistently
accelerates GD, and GD with warmup can converge at most $\Theta(T)$ times
faster than with a non-increasing learning rate schedule in some specific
cases, providing insights into the benefits of this strategy from an
optimization theory perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-agent applications require active coordination beyond collision avoidance to improve team performance by reducing traversal costs on high-risk edges through teammate support.

Method: Reformulates problem as 3D matching, proposes Joint-State Graph (JSG), Coordination-Exhaustive Search (CES), Receding-Horizon Optimistic Cooperative A* (RHOCA*), and Dynamic-HJSG for dynamic graph construction to prune redundant states.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows Dynamic-HJSG preserves optimality while reducing complexity from exponential to polynomial. Empirical results demonstrate scalability for large teams and graphs with significant runtime improvements.

Conclusion: Bridges combinatorial optimization and multi-agent planning, providing a principled framework for collaborative pathfinding with provable guarantees that can be extended to other collaborative optimization problems like MAPF.

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) traditionally focuses on collision avoidance,
but many real-world applications require active coordination between agents to
improve team performance. This paper introduces Team Coordination on Graphs
with Risky Edges (TCGRE), where agents collaborate to reduce traversal costs on
high-risk edges via support from teammates. We reformulate TCGRE as a 3D
matching problem-mapping robot pairs, support pairs, and time steps-and
rigorously prove its NP-hardness via reduction from Minimum 3D Matching. To
address this complexity, (in the conference version) we proposed efficient
decomposition methods, reducing the problem to tractable subproblems:
Joint-State Graph (JSG): Encodes coordination as a single-agent shortest-path
problem. Coordination-Exhaustive Search (CES): Optimizes support assignments
via exhaustive pairing. Receding-Horizon Optimistic Cooperative A* (RHOCA*):
Balances optimality and scalability via horizon-limited planning. Further in
this extension, we introduce a dynamic graph construction method
(Dynamic-HJSG), leveraging agent homogeneity to prune redundant states and
reduce computational overhead by constructing the joint-state graph
dynamically. Theoretical analysis shows Dynamic-HJSG preserves optimality while
lowering complexity from exponential to polynomial in key cases. Empirical
results validate scalability for large teams and graphs, with HJSG
outperforming baselines greatly in runtime in different sizes and types of
graphs. This work bridges combinatorial optimization and multi-agent planning,
offering a principled framework for collaborative pathfinding with provable
guarantees, and the key idea of the solution can be widely extended to many
other collaborative optimization problems, such as MAPF.

TL;DR: Proposes CEGT framework using Evolutionary Game Theory with causal evaluation to optimize AV interactions, outperforming traditional methods in safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in autonomous vehicle interactions including lack of centralized control, need to balance passenger demands and traffic efficiency, and limitations of traditional approaches like rule-based, optimization-based, and game-theoretic methods.

Method: Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) framework with causal evaluation module (CEGT) that uses decentralized adaptive strategy evolution and optimizes evolutionary rate by learning from historical interactions.

Result: CEGT outperforms EGT and benchmark games (Nash, Stackelberg) with lower collision rates, improved safety distances, higher speeds, and better overall performance across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed CEGT framework effectively addresses AV interaction challenges through adaptive evolutionary mechanisms and demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional game-theoretic approaches.

Abstract: Modern transportation systems face significant challenges in ensuring road
safety, given serious injuries caused by road accidents. The rapid growth of
autonomous vehicles (AVs) has prompted new traffic designs that aim to optimize
interactions among AVs. However, effective interactions between AVs remains
challenging due to the absence of centralized control. Besides, there is a need
for balancing multiple factors, including passenger demands and overall traffic
efficiency. Traditional rule-based, optimization-based, and game-theoretic
approaches each have limitations in addressing these challenges. Rule-based
methods struggle with adaptability and generalization in complex scenarios,
while optimization-based methods often require high computational resources.
Game-theoretic approaches, such as Stackelberg and Nash games, suffer from
limited adaptability and potential inefficiencies in cooperative settings. This
paper proposes an Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)-based framework for AV
interactions that overcomes these limitations by utilizing a decentralized and
adaptive strategy evolution mechanism. A causal evaluation module (CEGT) is
introduced to optimize the evolutionary rate, balancing mutation and evolution
by learning from historical interactions. Simulation results demonstrate the
proposed CEGT outperforms EGT and popular benchmark games in terms of lower
collision rates, improved safety distances, higher speeds, and overall better
performance compared to Nash and Stackelberg games across diverse scenarios and
parameter settings.

TL;DR: Minimal robot swarms can reach reliable consensus despite individual sensing errors, with bio-inspired cross-inhibition outperforming direct-switch mechanisms when asocial biases are present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordinating decentralized minimal robot swarms is challenging due to communication, computation, and memory constraints, especially when robots make sensing errors and asocial biases influence decision-making.

Method: Compared two opinion dynamics mechanisms (direct-switch and cross-inhibition) using generalized mean-field models that incorporate asocial biases affecting opinion dynamics.

Result: Cross-inhibition enables faster, more cohesive, accurate, robust, and scalable decisions across biased conditions, while direct-switch mechanisms suffer from performance deterioration and decision deadlocks.

Conclusion: Bio-inspired cross-inhibition provides superior coordination for minimal swarms and offers insights applicable to a broad class of decentralized decision-making systems in both biology and engineering.

Abstract: Minimalistic robot swarms offer a scalable, robust, and cost-effective
approach to performing complex tasks with the potential to transform
applications in healthcare, disaster response, and environmental monitoring.
However, coordinating such decentralised systems remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly when robots are constrained in communication,
computation, and memory. In our study, individual robots frequently make errors
when sensing the environment, yet the swarm can rapidly and reliably reach
consensus on the best among $n$ discrete options. We compare two canonical
mechanisms of opinion dynamics -- direct-switch and cross-inhibition -- which
are simple yet effective rules for collective information processing observed
in biological systems across scales, from neural populations to insect
colonies. We generalise the existing mean-field models by considering asocial
biases influencing the opinion dynamics. While swarms using direct-switch
reliably select the best option in absence of asocial dynamics, their
performance deteriorates once such biases are introduced, often resulting in
decision deadlocks. In contrast, bio-inspired cross-inhibition enables faster,
more cohesive, accurate, robust, and scalable decisions across a wide range of
biased conditions. Our findings provide theoretical and practical insights into
the coordination of minimal swarms and offer insights that extend to a broad
class of decentralised decision-making systems in biology and engineering.

Motivation: The diversity of user queries spanning multiple domains creates a complex routing challenge where traditional approaches struggle to balance performance and efficiency when directing queries to appropriate AI models and agents.

Method: MoMA integrates LLM and agent-based routing with precise intent recognition. It uses a detailed training dataset to profile LLM capabilities under different routing structures, and employs context-aware state machines with dynamic masking for efficient agent selection during inference.

Result: Experimental results show that MoMA achieves superior cost-efficiency and scalability compared to existing routing approaches, effectively balancing performance and cost optimization.

Conclusion: The MoMA framework successfully addresses the complex routing challenge in heterogeneous AI service ecosystems by providing an adaptive, efficient solution that dynamically routes queries to the most suitable LLMs and agents based on cost-performance considerations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific AI
agents has greatly expanded the ecosystem of AI-powered services. User queries,
however, are highly diverse and often span multiple domains and task types,
resulting in a complex and heterogeneous landscape. This diversity presents a
fundamental routing challenge: how to accurately direct each query to an
appropriate execution unit while optimizing both performance and efficiency. To
address this, we propose MoMA (Mixture of Models and Agents), a generalized
routing framework that integrates both LLM and agent-based routing. Built upon
a deep understanding of model and agent capabilities, MoMA effectively handles
diverse queries through precise intent recognition and adaptive routing
strategies, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and cost.
Specifically, we construct a detailed training dataset to profile the
capabilities of various LLMs under different routing model structures,
identifying the most suitable tasks for each LLM. During inference, queries are
dynamically routed to the LLM with the best cost-performance efficiency. We
also introduce an efficient agent selection strategy based on a context-aware
state machine and dynamic masking. Experimental results demonstrate that the
MoMA router offers superior cost-efficiency and scalability compared to
existing approaches.
