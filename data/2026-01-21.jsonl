However, most frameworks are homogeneous, where all agents share the same base LLM and differ only in prompts, tools, and positions in the workflow. This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow. Building on this finding, we propose \\textbf{OneFlow}, an algorithm that automatically tailors workflows for single-agent execution, reducing inference costs compared to existing automatic multi-agent design frameworks without trading off accuracy. These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research. We also note that single-LLM methods cannot capture heterogeneous workflows due to the lack of KV cache sharing across different LLMs, highlighting future opportunities in developing \\textit{truly} heterogeneous multi-agent systems."}

SF allows agents to operate over scoped views of shared memory, propose structured updates, and maintain global coherence through local ontology-based validation and refresh without centralized control or explicit message passing. The central theoretical result is a bisimulation theorem showing that each agent's local execution is behaviorally equivalent to its projection of the global semantics, in both deterministic and probabilistic settings. This enables safety, liveness, and temporal properties to be verified locally and soundly lifted to the full system. SF supports agents whose update proposals vary across invocations, including those generated by learned or heuristic components, provided updates pass semantic validation before integration. We establish deterministic and probabilistic guarantees ensuring semantic alignment under asynchronous or degraded communication. To validate the model operationally, we implement a lightweight reference architecture that instantiates its core mechanisms. A 250-agent simulation evaluates these properties across over 11,000 validated updates, demonstrating convergence under probabilistic refresh, bounded communication, and resilience to agent failure. Together, these results show that Semantic Fusion can provide a formal and scalable basis for verifiable autonomy in decentralized systems."}

Recently, a multitude of communication methods have been introduced to this field to address problems such as partially observable environments, non-stationarity, and exponentially growing action spaces. Communication further enables efficient cooperation among all agents interacting in an environment. This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning. By an in-depth analysis of 29 publications on this topic, the strengths and weaknesses of explicit, implicit, attention-based, graph-based, and hierarchical/role-based communication are evaluated. The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand. The comparison also highlights the importance of communication methods with low computational overhead to enable scalability to environments where many agents interact. Finally, the paper discusses current research gaps, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarking of system-level metrics and improved robustness under realistic communication conditions to enhance the real-world applicability of these approaches."}

Due to their impressive recall abilities, large language models (LLMs) have been recently explored for differential diagnosis. Existing approaches to evaluating LLM-based rare disease diagnosis suffer from two critical limitations: they rely on idealized clinical case studies that fail to capture real-world clinical complexity, or they use ICD codes as disease labels, which significantly undercounts rare diseases since many lack direct mappings to comprehensive rare disease databases like Orphanet. To address these limitations, we explore MIMIC-RD, a rare disease differential diagnosis benchmark constructed by directly mapping clinical text entities to Orphanet. Our methodology involved an initial LLM-based mining process followed by validation from four medical annotators to confirm identified entities were genuine rare diseases. We evaluated various models on our dataset of 145 patients and found that current state-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly on rare disease differential diagnosis, highlighting the substantial gap between existing capabilities and clinical needs. From our findings, we outline several future steps towards improving differential diagnosis of rare diseases."}

As MAS become increasingly deployed in web services (e.g., search engines), designing adaptive topologies for diverse cross-domain user queries becomes essential. Current graph learning-based design methodologies often adhere to a \"one-for-one\" paradigm, where a specialized model is trained for each specific task domain. This approach suffers from poor generalization to unseen domains and fails to leverage shared structural knowledge across different tasks. To address this, we propose OFA-TAD, a one-for-all framework that generates adaptive collaboration graphs for any task described in natural language through a single universal model. Our approach integrates a Task-Aware Graph State Encoder (TAGSE) that filters task-relevant node information via sparse gating, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically selects specialized sub-networks to drive node and edge prediction. We employ a three-stage training strategy: unconditional pre-training on canonical topologies for structural priors, large-scale conditional pre-training on LLM-generated datasets for task-topology mappings, and supervised fine-tuning on empirically validated graphs. Experiments across six diverse benchmarks show that OFA-TAD significantly outperforms specialized one-for-one models, generating highly adaptive MAS topologies.

Experiments across large-scale pre-training (English C4, Vietnamese VietVault) and fine-tuning (GLUE) demonstrate that AdaFRUGAL achieves a compelling trade-off.

Most deployed artificial systems realise their functions via sequential or time-multiplexed updates. Conscious experience appears unified and simultaneous. I show that this difference matters formally. I augment Stack Theory with algebraic laws relating within time-window constraint satisfaction to conjunction. I introduce a precise temporal semantics over windowed trajectories $τ^{Δ,s}$ and prove that existential temporal realisation $\\Diamond_Δ$ does not preserve conjunction. A system can realise all the ingredients of experience across time without ever instantiating the experienced conjunction itself. I then distinguish two postulates. StrongSync requires objective co-instantiation of the grounded conjunction within the window, while WeakSync permits temporal ``smearing''. I formalise concurrency-capacity to measure what is needed to satisfy StrongSync. Finally, I review neurophysiological evidence suggesting that consciousness depends on phase synchrony and effective connectivity, and that loss of consciousness is often associated with its breakdown. This evidence makes WeakSync less plausible. Under StrongSync, software consciousness on strictly sequential substrates is impossible for contents whose grounding requires two or more simultaneous contributors. The more parts from which simultaneous contribution required, the more concurrency capacity is required. The hardware matters. Consciousness attribution therefore requires architectural inspection, not just functional performance."}

We demonstrate that the L2 normalization constraint, a characteristic of many LLM architectures, results in a structured embedding space suitable for analysis using a Hamiltonian formalism. We derive relationships between cosine similarity and perturbations of embedding vectors, and explore direct and indirect semantic transitions. Furthermore, we explore a quantum-inspired perspective, deriving an analogue of zero-point energy and discussing potential connections to Koopman-von Neumann mechanics.

Most interpretability approaches emphasise static representations or causal interventions, leaving temporal structure largely unexplored. Drawing on neuroscience, where temporal integration and metastability are core markers of neural organisation, we adapt these concepts to transformer models and discuss a composite dynamical metric, computed from activation time-series during autoregressive generation. We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons. These results are robust to layer selection, channel subsampling, and random seeds. Our findings demonstrate that neuroscience-inspired dynamical metrics can reliably characterise differences in computational organisation across functional regimes in large language models. We stress that the proposed metric captures formal dynamical properties and does not imply subjective experience."}

However, policy gradient methods such as PPO suffer from high variance gradient estimates, requiring careful hyperparameter tuning and extensive computational resources. We introduce GRADE (Gumbel-softmax Relaxation for Alignment via Differentiable Estimation), a method that replaces high-variance policy gradient estimation with direct backpropagation through a differentiable relaxation of the discrete token sampling process. Using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization with straight-through estimation (GRADE-STE), we enable end-to-end gradient flow from reward signals through generated tokens to model parameters. On sentiment-controlled text generation using the IMDB dataset, GRADE-STE achieves a test reward of 0.763 +- 0.344 compared to PPO's 0.510 +- 0.313 and REINFORCE's 0.617 +- 0.378, representing a 50% relative improvement over PPO. Critically, GRADE-STE exhibits gradient variance over 14 times lower than REINFORCE and maintains stable training dynamics throughout optimization. Our rigorous evaluation with proper train/validation/test splits demonstrates that these improvements generalize to held-out data, with GRADE-STE showing the best generalization characteristics among all methods tested. GRADE offers a simpler, more stable, and more effective alternative to reinforcement learning for LLM alignment."}

RSP is computed from within-run drift dynamics and requires no tuning on out-of-distribution data. Across multiple lightweight transformer classifiers and benchmark classification tasks, drift typically collapses into a low, stable regime early in training, while validation accuracy continues to change only marginally. In a controlled shortcut setting with label-correlated trigger tokens, attribution dynamics expose increasing reliance on the shortcut even when validation accuracy remains competitive. Overall, explanation drift provides a simple, low-cost diagnostic for monitoring how decision evidence evolves during fine-tuning and for selecting checkpoints in a stable-evidence regime."}

We address this problem of stylistically improving designs based on natural language instructions. While VLMs have shown initial success in graphic design, their pretrained knowledge on styles is often too general and misaligned with specific domain data. For example, VLMs may associate minimalism with abstract designs, whereas designers emphasize shape and color choices. Our key insight is to leverage design data -- a collection of real-world designs that implicitly capture designer's principles -- to learn design knowledge and guide stylistic improvement. We propose PRISM (PRior-Informed Stylistic Modification) that constructs and applies a design knowledge base through three stages: (1) clustering high-variance designs to capture diversity within a style, (2) summarizing each cluster into actionable design knowledge, and (3) retrieving relevant knowledge during inference to enable style-aware improvement.

The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM deployments."}

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence."}

In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new technological approaches to problem-generation tasks. Although existing LLMs can achieve high correctness rates, they generally lack innovation and exhibit poor discrimination. In this paper, we propose the task of innovative math problem generation (IMPG). To solve the IMPG task, this paper proposes a self-evolving, multi-role collaborative framework with fine-grained difficulty guidance. First, a multi-role collaborative mechanism comprising a sampler, generator, evaluator, state machine, and memory is constructed, ensuring the correctness of generated problems through iterative optimization informed by self-assessment and external feedback. Second, we introduce an improved difficulty model to quantify difficulty and provide fine-grained guidance. We adopt the data-driven association-guided path sampling (DAPS) algorithm to enhance the semantic rationality of sampled encodings. Third, we construct the HSM3K-CN dataset, which comprises high-quality high school math problems. A multi-stage training pipeline is adopted, incorporating continual pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), to enhance the generation and evaluation capabilities of the base model. Finally, system self-evolution is achieved by transferring evaluation capabilities from the expert model to the apprentice model via distillation. Experiments show that, compared to baseline models, our proposed method significantly improves the innovation of the generated problems while maintaining a high correctness rate."}

Using ubiquitous sensors such as Passive InfraRed sensors (PIR) and door sensors is drawing increasing interest for monitoring daily activities and facilitating preventative healthcare interventions for the elderly. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from passive sensors mostly relies on traditional machine learning and includes data segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. While techniques like Sensor Weighting Mutual Information (SWMI) capture spatial context in a feature vector, effectively leveraging temporal information remains a challenge. We tackle this by clustering activities into morning, afternoon, and night, and encoding them into the feature weighting method calculating distinct mutual information matrices. We further propose to extend the feature vector by incorporating time of day and day of week as cyclical temporal features, as well as adding a feature to track the user's location. The experiments show improved accuracy and F1-score over existing state-of-the-art methods in three out of four real-world datasets, with highest gains in a low-data regime.

However, during the initial stage of CAV deployment, the sparse distribution of CAVs among human-driven vehicles reduces the likelihood of forming effective cooperative platoons. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid multi-agent lane change decision model aimed at increasing CAV participation in cooperative platooning and maximizing its associated benefits. The proposed model employs the QMIX framework, integrating traffic data processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN-QMIX). This architecture addresses a critical issue in dynamic traffic scenarios by enabling CAVs to make optimal decisions irrespective of the varying number of CAVs present in mixed traffic. Additionally, a trajectory planner and a model predictive controller are designed to ensure smooth and safe lane-change execution. The proposed model is trained and evaluated within a microsimulation environment under varying CAV market penetration rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently manages fluctuating traffic agent numbers, significantly outperforming the baseline rule-based models. Notably, it enhances cooperative platooning rates up to 26.2\\%, showcasing its potential to optimize CAV cooperation and traffic dynamics during the early stage of deployment."}

This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at <$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%).

Hypoglycemia is a critical state of decreased blood glucose levels (BGL) below 70 mg/dL and is associated with increased risk of mortality. Machine learning (ML) models can improve diabetes management by predicting hypoglycemia and providing optimal prevention methods. ML models are classified into regression and classification based, that forecast glucose levels and identify events based on defined labels, respectively. This review investigates state-of-the-art models trained on data of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices from patients with T1D. We compare the models' performance across short-term (15 to 120 min) and long term (3 to more than 24 hours) prediction horizons (PHs). Particularly, we explore: 1) How much in advance can glucose values or a hypoglycemic event be accurately predicted? 2) Which models have the best performance? 3) Which factors impact the performance? and 4) Does personalization increase performance? The results show that 1) a PH of up to 1 hour provides the best results. 2) Conventional ML methods yield the best results for classification and DL for regression.

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance."}

Automated PICOS compliance and study design classification from titles and abstracts were performed using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory baseline and a transformer-based multi-task classifier fine-tuned from PubMedBERT. Full-text synthesis employed retrieval-augmented generation with hybrid vector and graph retrieval, while BERTopic was used to identify thematic structure, redundancy, and evidence gaps. The transformer model achieved 95.7% accuracy for study design classification with strong agreement against expert annotations, while the Bi-LSTM achieved 87% accuracy for PICOS compliance detection. Retrieval-augmented generation outperformed non-retrieval generation for queries requiring structured constraints, cross-study integration, and graph-based reasoning, whereas non-retrieval approaches remained competitive for high-level summaries.

Probe families induce an operational equivalence relation on kernels and therefore a gauge; anchors select representatives relative to that probe. Under a scalar relational-work representation and a multiplicative compositionality law for evidence, the admissible link family is exponential, yielding Gibbs weights; with row anchoring this includes the softmax kernel family as a subregime. After quotienting unary row/column score fields, the remaining interaction component admits a canonical rank-r normal form (Eckart-Young/SVD); dot-product score charts implement the corresponding low-rank interaction regime. Fixing the carrier and extensionalizing the update yields the standard fixed-token Transformer attention operator; allowing carrier updates yields adaptive-carrier and staged-depth regimes. The operator language also supports multihead/mixed kernels, plan-based anchors (e.g., entropic OT/Sinkhorn), and unary operators (e.g., FFN-style fields) as explicit regime choices. This separates invariant structure from modeling choice, enabling principled comparison and extension of attention mechanisms, and attention-based architectures."}

However, rigorously quantifying how well a PINN captures the complete dynamical behavior of the system, beyond simple trajectory prediction, remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel experimental framework to address this by employing Fisher information for differentiable dynamical systems, denoted $g_F^C$. This Fisher information, distinct from its statistical counterpart, measures inherent uncertainties in deterministic systems, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, and is related to the phase space curvature and the net stretching action of the state space evolution. We hypothesize that if a PINN accurately learns the underlying dynamics of a physical system, then the Fisher information landscape derived from the PINN's learned equations of motion will closely match that of the original analytical model. This match would signify that the PINN has achieved comprehensive fidelity capturing not only the state evolution but also crucial geometric and stability properties. We outline an experimental methodology using the dynamical model of a car to compute and compare $g_F^C$ for both the analytical model and a trained PINN. The comparison, based on the Jacobians of the respective system dynamics, provides a quantitative measure of the PINN's fidelity in representing the system's intricate dynamical characteristics."}

Analysis reveals that kernels display anti-clustering behavior, evolving into a learned \"active filtration\" strategy distinct from traditional h- or p-adaptivity. Effective receptive field analysis confirms that D-PARC autonomously concentrates resources in high-strain regions while coarsening focus elsewhere, mirroring adaptive refinement in computational mechanics. This demonstrates that physically intuitive architectural design can outperform parameter scaling, establishing that strategic learning in lean networks offers a more effective path forward for PADL than indiscriminate network expansion."}

Previous version with human-AI collaboration: arXiv:2410.14640", "summary": "We introduce a unified framework that seamlessly integrates algorithmic recourse, contextual bandits, and large language models (LLMs) to support sequential decision-making in high-stakes settings such as personalized medicine. We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks. Our results highlight the promise of recourse-aware, LLM-assisted bandit algorithms for trustworthy LLM-bandits collaboration in personalized high-stakes decision-making."}

In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework capable of accurately predicting the wettability of laser-textured metal alloys using experimentally derived morphological and chemical features. Superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys via nanosecond laser texturing followed by chemical immersion treatments. Surface morphology was quantified using the Laws texture energy method and profilometry, while surface chemistry was characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extracting features such as functional group polarity, molecular volume, and peak area fraction. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. The model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896), outperforming previous approaches. Feature importance analysis revealed that surface chemistry had the strongest influence on contact angle prediction, with topographical features also contributing significantly. This work demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to model and predict wetting behavior by capturing the complex interplay of surface characteristics, offering a data-driven pathway for designing tailored functional surfaces."}

On a curated subset of DAPO-MATH, 89\\% of failures exhibit such traps. To solve this problem, we introduce TAAR (Trap-Aware Adaptive Restart), a test-time control framework that trains a diagnostic policy to predict two signals from partial trajectories: a trap index for where to truncate and an escape probability for whether and how strongly to intervene. At inference time, TAAR truncates the trajectory before the predicted trap segment and adaptively restarts decoding; for severely trapped cases, it applies stronger perturbations, including higher-temperature resampling and an optional structured reboot suffix. Experiments on challenging mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-Diamond, HMMT25, BRUMO25) show that TAAR improves reasoning performance without fine-tuning base model parameters."}

Two dominant paradigms have emerged: activation-aware methods such as AWQ prioritize channels with large activation magnitudes, while second-order methods such as GPTQ allocate quantization error according to input covariance structure. Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we show that sensitivity naturally arises as the squared norm of gradient-weighted activations, yielding a principled measure of channel importance that captures both activation magnitude and downstream error propagation. Within this framework, AWQ and GPTQ can be interpreted as complementary approximations that recover sensitivity under distinct simplifying assumptions. We analyze the design space of sensitivity metrics, connect gradient-based saliency, Fisher information, and Hessian-based criteria, and clarify their relationships to classical pruning methods such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon. Rather than proposing a new quantization algorithm, this work provides a conceptual foundation for understanding and comparing post-training quantization methods through the lens of sensitivity."}

To address this, we propose Metacognitive Agent Reflective Self-improvement (MARS), a framework that achieves efficient self-evolution within a single recurrence cycle. Inspired by educational psychology, MARS mimics human learning by integrating principle-based reflection (abstracting normative rules to avoid errors) and procedural reflection (deriving step-by-step strategies for success). By synthesizing these insights into optimized instructions, MARS allows agents to systematically refine their reasoning logic without continuous online feedback. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MARS outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving systems while significantly reducing computational overhead."}

Hybrid models that integrate full and linear attention layers promise a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but face two major challenges: training such hybrid models from scratch is computationally expensive, and manually designing the optimal placement of attention types is highly nontrivial. We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task. This yields a task-specific hybrid model in a single efficient pass, without costly re-training or neural architecture search, and can be applied to any pretrained full-attention backbone for diverse downstream tasks."}

However, its potential for enhancing tasks that demand step-by-step logical deduction, such as mathematical reasoning, remains underexplored. A core limitation of existing ICL approaches is their static use of demonstrations: examples are pre-selected before inference and remain fixed, failing to adapt to the dynamic confusion points that often arise during multi-step reasoning such as ambiguous calculations or logical gaps. These unresolved confusion points can lead to cascading errors that degrade final accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose Process In-Context Learning (PICL), a dynamic demonstration integration framework designed to boost mathematical reasoning by responding to real-time inference needs. PICL operates in two stages: 1)~it identifies potential confusion points by analyzing semantics and entropy in the reasoning process and summarizes their core characteristics; 2)~upon encountering these points, it retrieves relevant demonstrations from the demonstration pool that match the confusion context and inserts them directly into the ongoing reasoning process to guide subsequent steps. Experiments show that PICL outperforms baseline methods by mitigating mid-inference confusion, highlighting the value of adaptive demonstration insertion in complex mathematical reasoning."}

However, stemming from the batch-independence assumption during testing, which prevents the model from leveraging valuable knowledge accumulated from previous batches. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time method called Incremental Prototype Enhancement Classifier (IPEC), a test-time method that optimizes prototype estimation by leveraging information from previous query samples. IPEC maintains a dynamic auxiliary set by selectively incorporating query samples that are classified with high confidence. To ensure sample quality, we design a robust dual-filtering mechanism that assesses each query sample based on both global prediction confidence and local discriminative ability. By aggregating this auxiliary set with the support set in subsequent tasks, IPEC builds progressively more stable and representative prototypes, effectively reducing its reliance on the initial support set. We ground this approach in a Bayesian interpretation, conceptualizing the support set as a prior and the auxiliary set as a data-driven posterior, which in turn motivates the design of a practical \"warm-up and test\" two-stage inference protocol. Extensive empirical results validate the superior performance of our proposed method across multiple few-shot classification tasks."}

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller."}

In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

While recent benchmarks have focused on evaluating the structural correctness of such outputs, the environmental impact of inference for different output formats has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we argue that structured output formats should be assessed not only in terms of correctness, but also with respect to their environmental efficiency. To this end, we introduce a sustainability-aware evaluation framework for structured generation that measures token usage, generation time, and estimated carbon emissions. Within this framework, we propose the Environment-Aware Generation Correctness Score (GCS_env), a unified metric that integrates structural correctness with carbon-aware efficiency. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark the novel TOON format against established representations (JSON, XML, YAML) across multiple LLMs spanning different architectures and parameter scales.\n  Our results reveal a consistent trade-off: TOON yields markedly more compact outputs and lower emissions, but lower structural correctness when models lack native support. We show that increased model capacity reduces this gap and that environment-aware scoring can shift format rankings depending on deployment priorities. highlighting the need for sustainability-inclusive benchmarking and provides empirical evidence that compact representations such as TOON can offer practical advantages in large-scale, carbon-conscious LLM deployments."}

We observe that pre-training on unlabeled jets leads to emergent semantic class clustering in the representation space. The clustering in the frozen embedding, when pre-trained on background jets only, enables anomaly detection via simple distance-based metrics, and the learned embedding can be fine-tuned for classification with improved performance compared to supervised models trained from scratch."}

Motivated by this perspective, we propose ARC, which is the first framework to systematically formulate context management as an active, reflection-driven process that treats context as a dynamic internal reasoning state during execution. ARC operationalizes this view through reflection-driven monitoring and revision, allowing agents to actively reorganize their working context when misalignment or degradation is detected.

This phenomenon describes the behavior of gradient alignment in SGD updates. Specifically, during the initial phase of SGD updates, the alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace tends to decrease. Subsequently, it enters a rising phase and eventually stabilizes in a high-alignment phase. The alignment is considered ``suspicious'' because, paradoxically, the projected gradient update along this highly-aligned dominant subspace proves ineffective at reducing the loss. The focus of this work is to give a fine-grained analysis in a high-dimensional quadratic setup about how step size selection produces this phenomenon. Our main contribution can be summarized as follows: We propose a step-size condition revealing that in low-alignment regimes, an adaptive critical step size $η_t^*$ separates alignment-decreasing ($η_t < η_t^*$) from alignment-increasing ($η_t > η_t^*$) regimes, whereas in high-alignment regimes, the alignment is self-correcting and decreases regardless of the step size. We further show that under sufficient ill-conditioning, a step size interval exists where projecting the SGD updates to the bulk space decreases the loss while projecting them to the dominant space increases the loss, which explains a recent empirical observation that projecting gradient updates to the dominant subspace is ineffective. Finally, based on this adaptive step-size theory, we prove that for a constant step size and large initialization, SGD exhibits this distinct two-phase behavior: an initial alignment-decreasing phase, followed by stabilization at high alignment."}

Existing extensions, including bipolar argumentation frameworks, introduce support relations, but these do not capture the asymmetric and constitutive nature of subarguments or their interaction with attacks. In this paper, we study abstract argumentation frameworks enriched with an explicit subargument relation, treated alongside attack as a basic relation. We analyse how subargument relations interact with attacks and examine their impact on fundamental semantic properties.

To address these limitations, we propose UniMo, a novel framework that integrates motion-language information and interpretable chain of thought (CoT) reasoning into the LLM via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We further introduce reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a post-training strategy that optimizes over groups of tokens to enforce structural correctness and semantic alignment, mitigating cumulative errors in motion token prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMo significantly outperforms existing unified and task-specific models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both motion generation and understanding."}

We introduce MixFlow, a conditional flow-matching framework for descriptor-controlled generation that directly targets this limitation by jointly learning a descriptor-conditioned base distribution and a descriptor-conditioned flow field via shortest-path flow matching. By modeling the base distribution as a learnable, descriptor-dependent mixture, MixFlow enables smooth interpolation and extrapolation to unseen conditions, leading to substantially improved out-of-distribution generalization. We provide analytical insights into the behavior of the proposed framework and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple domains, including prediction of responses to unseen perturbations in single-cell transcriptomic data and high-content microscopy-based drug screening tasks. Across these diverse settings, MixFlow consistently outperforms standard conditional flow-matching baselines. Overall, MixFlow offers a simple yet powerful approach for achieving robust, generalizable, and controllable generative modeling across heterogeneous domains."}

In this paper, we introduce DriveSafe, a hierarchical, four-level risk taxonomy designed to systematically characterize safety-critical failure modes of LLM-based driving assistants.

However, traditional global norm clipping erroneously presupposes gradient homogeneity across different functional modules, leading to an adverse \"spill-over\" effect where volatile parameters force unnecessary scaling on stable ones. To overcome this, we propose Adaptive Group-wise Gradient Clipping (AGGC). AGGC partitions parameters into groups based on functional types and regulates each according to its historical behavior using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Specifically, it constructs an adaptive interval to simultaneously mitigate gradient explosion and vanishing, while employing a time-dependent scheduling mechanism to balance exploration and convergence. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B models show that AGGC consistently outperforms LoRA and frequently surpasses Full Fine-Tuning. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with AGGC achieves an accuracy of 72.93%, exceeding LoRA's 69.5%. AGGC also effectively stabilizes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), enhancing the logic deduction of Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.2 models. Experimental results demonstrate that AGGC effectively addresses the limitations of traditional gradient clipping methods, particularly in overcoming gradient heterogeneity, by utilizing a modular, adaptive clipping strategy to stabilize the training process. Due to its lightweight design, AGGC can be seamlessly integrated into existing post-training pipelines with negligible overhead."}

Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf ) provides a robust formalism for encoding these temporal goals. Traditional LTLf task planning approaches often transform the temporal planning problem into a classical planning problem with reachability goals, which are then solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, these methods often lack informed heuristics to provide a guided search for temporal goals. We introduce TIDE (Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration), a novel approach that addresses this limitation by decomposing a temporal problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable reach-avoid sub-problems, each solvable using an off-the-shelf planner. TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TIDE achieves promising performance and is a valuable addition to the portfolio of planning methods for temporally extended goals."}

This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. To facilitate low-data learning, TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation. To derive prompts that cover essential conditions, we introduce the Financial Market Attribute Protocol (FinMAP) - a multi-level description system that standardizes daily$/$periodical market dynamics by recognizing 17$/$23 economic indicators from 7/8 perspectives. In our experiments, we gather four types of treasury futures data covering the period from 2015 to 2025, and define data synthesis tasks with durations ranging from one week to four months. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TF-CoDiT can produce highly authentic data with errors at most 0.433 (MSE) and 0.453 (MAE) to the ground-truth. Further studies evidence the robustness of TF-CoDiT across contracts and temporal horizons."}

The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations. Several works have proposed to mitigate this, including the optimization of power allocation known as joint resource allocation(JRA) method, and integration of the JRA method and deep reinforcement learning (JRA-DRL). Despite this, the channel assignment problem remains unclear and requires further investigation. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework incorporating replay memory with an on-policy algorithm, allocating network resources in a NOMA system to generalize the learning. Also, we provide extensive simulations to evaluate the effects of varying the learning rate, batch size, type of model, and the number of features in the state."}

Although general CL constraints significantly increase the hardness of approximation, previous work has shown that disjoint CL sets permit constant-factor approximations. However, whether local search can achieve such a guarantee in this setting remains an open question. To this end, we propose a novel local search framework based on a transformation to a dominating matching set problem, achieving the best possible approximation ratio of 2.

Inspired by their success, recent works in the molecular domain have led to the development of large molecular language models (LMLMs) that integrate 1D molecular strings or 2D molecular graphs into the language models. However, existing LMLMs often suffer from hallucination and limited robustness, largely due to inadequate integration of diverse molecular modalities such as 1D sequences, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformations. To address these limitations, we propose CoLLaMo, a large language model-based molecular assistant equipped with a multi-level molecular modality-collaborative projector. The relation-aware modality-collaborative attention mechanism in the projector facilitates fine-grained and relation-guided information exchange between atoms by incorporating 2D structural and 3D spatial relations. Furthermore, we present a molecule-centric new automatic measurement, including a hallucination assessment metric and GPT-based caption quality evaluation to address the limitations of token-based generic evaluation metrics (i.e., BLEU) widely used in assessing molecular comprehension of LMLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our CoLLaMo enhances the molecular modality generalization capabilities of LMLMs, achieving the best performance on multiple tasks, including molecule captioning, computed property QA, descriptive property QA, motif counting, and IUPAC name prediction."}

This family unifies several widely studied objectives within a single framework, including divergence-based marginal matching, weighted average coverage, and worst-case (minimax) coverage. While the concavity of $U_ρ$ captures the diminishing return associated with over-exploration, the simple closed form of the gradient of $U_ρ$ enables an explicit control to prioritize under-explored state--action pairs. Leveraging this structure, we develop a gradient-based algorithm that actively steers the induced occupancy toward a desired coverage pattern. Moreover, we show that as $ρ$ increases, the resulting exploration strategy increasingly emphasizes the least-explored state--action pairs, recovering worst-case coverage behavior in the limit."}

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong zero-shot abilities, they still suffer from hallucination and limited domain grounding. In contrast, discriminative Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) provide reliable grounding but require costly annotations to cover new domains. We introduce Docs2Synth, a synthetic-supervision framework that enables retrieval-guided inference for private and low-resource domains. Docs2Synth automatically processes raw document collections, generates and verifies diverse QA pairs via an agent-based system, and trains a lightweight visual retriever to extract domain-relevant evidence. During inference, the retriever collaborates with an MLLM through an iterative retrieval--generation loop, reducing hallucination and improving response consistency.

For fair supervised learning, particularly in pre-processing, there have been two main categories: data fairness and task-tailored fairness. The former directly finds an intermediate distribution among the groups, independent of the type of the downstream model, so a learned downstream classification/regression model returns similar predictive scores to individuals inputting the same covariates irrespective of their sensitive attributes. The latter explicitly takes the supervised learning task into account when constructing the pre-processing map. In this work, we study algorithmic fairness for supervised learning and argue that the data fairness approaches impose overly strong regularization from the perspective of the HGR correlation. This motivates us to devise a novel pre-processing approach tailored to supervised learning. We account for the trade-off between fairness and utility in obtaining the pre-processing map. Then we study the behavior of arbitrary downstream supervised models learned on the transformed data to find sufficient conditions to guarantee their fairness improvement and utility preservation. To our knowledge, no prior work in the branch of task-tailored methods has theoretically investigated downstream guarantees when using pre-processed data. We further evaluate our framework through comparison studies based on tabular and image data sets, showing the superiority of our framework which preserves consistent trade-offs among multiple downstream models compared to recent competing models.

In each of $T$ rounds, each of $N$ agents selects an arm, the environment generates a clean reward vector, and an adversary perturbs the observed feedback subject to a global corruption budget $Γ$. Performance is measured by team regret under a coordinate-wise nondecreasing, $L$-Lipschitz scalarization $φ$, covering linear, Chebyshev, and smooth monotone utilities. Our main contribution is a communication-corruption coupling: we show that a fixed environment-side budget $Γ$ can translate into an effective corruption level ranging from $Γ$ to $NΓ$, depending on whether agents share raw samples, sufficient statistics, or only arm recommendations. We formalize this via a protocol-induced multiplicity functional and prove regret bounds parameterized by the resulting effective corruption. As corollaries, raw-sample sharing can suffer an $N$-fold larger additive corruption penalty, whereas summary sharing and recommendation-only sharing preserve an unamplified $O(Γ)$ term and achieve centralized-rate team regret. We further establish information-theoretic limits, including an unavoidable additive $Ω(Γ)$ penalty and a high-corruption regime $Γ=Θ(NT)$ where sublinear regret is impossible without clean information. Finally, we characterize how a global budget $ν$ of verified observations restores learnability. That is, verification is necessary in the high-corruption regime, and sufficient once it crosses the identification threshold, with certified sharing enabling the team's regret to become independent of $Γ$."}

Candidate behaviours are executed under real resource constraints, and only those whose environmental effects both persist and preserve the possibility of future interaction are propagated. The environment does not provide semantic feedback, dense rewards, or task-specific supervision; selection operates solely through differential survival of behaviours as world-altering events, making proxy optimisation impossible and rendering reward-hacking evolutionarily unstable.\n  Analysis of semantic dynamics shows that improvement arises primarily through the persistence of effective and repeatable strategies under a regime of consolidation and pruning, a paradigm we refer to as negative-space learning (NSL), and that models develop meta-learning strategies (such as deliberate experimental failure in order to elicit informative error messages) without explicit instruction. This work establishes that environment-grounded selection enables sustainable open-ended self-improvement, offering a viable path toward more robust and generalisable autonomous systems without reliance on human-curated data or complex reward shaping."}

We evaluate the approach on PDE-informed regression benchmarks and standard regression datasets under a fixed training budget in a simulator setting. Empirically, the proposed framework consistently improves over pure QNN baselines and yields more stable convergence in data-limited regimes.

However, existing CRL algorithms often encounter significant constraint violations during training, limiting their applicability in safety-critical scenarios.

To address this issue, we propose the Memory-driven Intrinsic Cost Estimation (MICE) method, which introduces intrinsic costs to mitigate underestimation and control bias to promote safer exploration. Inspired by flashbulb memory, where humans vividly recall dangerous experiences to avoid risks, MICE constructs a memory module that stores previously explored unsafe states to identify high-cost regions. The intrinsic cost is formulated as the pseudo-count of the current state visiting these risk regions. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic-intrinsic cost value function that incorporates intrinsic costs and adopts a bias correction strategy. Using this function, we formulate an optimization objective within the trust region, along with corresponding optimization methods. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for the proposed cost value function and establish the worst-case constraint violation for the MICE update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MICE significantly reduces constraint violations while preserving policy performance comparable to baselines."}

Specifically, MARO first addresses the sparse learning signal problem by decomposing final success or failure outcomes into each specific behavior during the interaction process; second, it handles the uneven role distribution problem by balancing the training sample weights of different roles; finally, it addresses environmental instability issues by directly evaluating the utility of each behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO not only achieves significant improvements in social reasoning capabilities, but also that the abilities acquired through social simulation learning can effectively transfer to other tasks such as mathematical reasoning and instruction following. This reveals the tremendous potential of multi-agent social learning in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs."}

Traditional approaches typically pre-train models using dynamic link prediction and directly apply the resulting node temporal embeddings to specific downstream tasks. However, the significant differences among downstream tasks often lead to performance degradation, especially under few-shot settings. Prompt tuning has emerged as an effective solution to this problem. Existing prompting methods are often strongly coupled with specific model architectures or pretraining tasks, which makes it difficult to adapt to recent or future model designs. Moreover, their exclusive focus on modifying node or temporal features while neglecting spatial structural information leads to limited expressiveness and degraded performance. To address these limitations, we propose DDGPrompt, a data-centric prompting framework designed to effectively refine pre-trained node embeddings at the input data level, enabling better adaptability to diverse downstream tasks. We first define a unified node expression feature matrix that aggregates all relevant temporal and structural information of each node, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of dynamic graph models. Then, we introduce three prompt matrices (temporal bias, edge weight, and feature mask) to adjust the feature matrix completely, achieving task-specific adaptation of node embeddings. We evaluate DDGPrompt under a strict few-shot setting on four public dynamic graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional methods and prompting approaches in scenarios with limited labels and cold-start conditions."}

We propose a modular two-LLM framework in which an Issue model extracts salient issues and assigns coarse themes, and an Advice model generates targeted operational fixes conditioned on the extracted issue representation. To enable specialization without expensive full fine-tuning, we adapt the Advice model using a mixture of LoRA experts strategy: multiple low-rank adapters are trained and a lightweight gating mechanism performs token-level expert mixing at inference, combining complementary expertise across issue types. We construct synthetic review-issue-advice triples from Yelp reviews (airlines and restaurants) to supervise training, and evaluate recommendations using an eight dimension operational rubric spanning actionability, specificity, feasibility, expected impact, novelty, non-redundancy, bias, and clarity. Across both domains, our approach consistently outperforms prompting-only and single-adapter baselines, yielding higher actionability and specificity while retaining favorable efficiency-quality trade-offs."}

To bridge these gaps, we propose PsychēChat, which explicitly integrates emotion shift tracking and safety risk analysis for psychological counseling. Specifically, we employ interactive role-playing to synthesize counselor--seeker dialogues, incorporating two modules: Emotion Management Module, to capture seekers' current emotions and emotion shifts; and Risk Control Module, to anticipate seekers' subsequent reactions and identify potential risks. Furthermore, we introduce two modeling paradigms. The Agent Mode structures emotion management, risk control, and counselor responses into a collaborative multi-agent pipeline. The LLM Mode integrates these stages into a unified chain-of-thought for end-to-end inference, balancing efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments, including interactive scoring, dialogue-level evaluation, and human assessment, demonstrate that PsychēChat outperforms existing methods for emotional insight and safety control."}

Traditional forecasting methods require significant expert knowledge and struggle to generalize across diverse deployment scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained time series models offer new opportunities, but their zero-shot performance on domain-specific tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation. Our findings suggest that MoE-Encoder provides a scalable and privacy-aware extension to foundation time series models."}

We design two tasks to test (1) if LLMs can detect when story characters, through their actions, demonstrate knowledge they should not possess, and (2) if LLMs can predict story characters' next actions based on their own knowledge vs. objective truths they do not know. Results reveal that most current state-of-the-art LLMs achieve near-random performance on both tasks, and are substantially inferior to humans.

Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses this by maximizing returns under predefined constraints, typically formulated as the expected cumulative cost. However, expectation-based constraints overlook rare but high-impact extreme value events in the tail distribution, such as black swan incidents, which can lead to severe constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose the Extreme Value policy Optimization (EVO) algorithm, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to model and exploit extreme reward and cost samples, reducing constraint violations. EVO introduces an extreme quantile optimization objective to explicitly capture extreme samples in the cost tail distribution. Additionally, we propose an extreme prioritization mechanism during replay, amplifying the learning signal from rare but high-impact extreme samples. Theoretically, we establish upper bounds on expected constraint violations during policy updates, guaranteeing strict constraint satisfaction at a zero-violation quantile level. Further, we demonstrate that EVO achieves a lower probability of constraint violations than expectation-based methods and exhibits lower variance than quantile regression methods. Extensive experiments show that EVO significantly reduces constraint violations during training while maintaining competitive policy performance compared to baselines."}

While it fails to alter the terminal learning phase in overparameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on high-dimensional datasets, empirical evidence consistently shows it offers significant benefits early in training. To transparently demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a small-scale model (SSM). This model is specifically designed to abstract the inherent complexities of both the DNN architecture and the input data, while maintaining key information about the structure of imbalance within its spectral components. On the one hand, the SSM reveals how vanilla empirical risk minimization preferentially learns to distinguish majority classes over minorities early in training, consequently delaying minority learning. In stark contrast, reweighting restores balanced learning dynamics, enabling the simultaneous learning of features associated with both majorities and minorities."}

Whether these failures stem from an inability to locate evidence (recognition failure) or integrate it (synthesis failure) is unclear. We introduce Multi-Focus Attention Instruction (MFAI), a semantic probe to disentangle these mechanisms by explicitly steering attention towards selected positions. Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the \"Weakest Link Law\": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $<3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that \"thinking\" models that utilize System-2 reasoning, effectively locate and integrate the required information, matching gold-only baselines even in noisy, long-context settings."}

Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment."}

Answering this question requires rigorous evaluation and effective mitigation, but existing approaches fall short on both fronts: evaluation methods force outputs into predefined cultural categories without a neutral option, while mitigation relies on expensive multi-cultural corpora or agent frameworks that use functional roles (e.g., Planner--Critique) lacking explicit cultural representation. To address these gaps, we introduce CEBiasBench, a Chinese--English bilingual benchmark, and Multi-Agent Vote (MAV), which enables explicit ``no bias'' judgments. Using this framework, we find that Chinese prompting merely shifts bias toward East Asian perspectives rather than eliminating it. To mitigate such persistent bias, we propose Multi-Agent Cultural Debate (MACD), a training-free framework that assigns agents distinct cultural personas and orchestrates deliberation via a \"Seeking Common Ground while Reserving Differences\" strategy. Experiments demonstrate that MACD achieves 57.6% average No Bias Rate evaluated by LLM-as-judge and 86.0% evaluated by MAV (vs. 47.6% and 69.0% baseline using GPT-4o as backbone) on CEBiasBench and generalizes to the Arabic CAMeL benchmark, confirming that explicit cultural representation in agent frameworks is essential for cross-cultural fairness."}

To address these limitations, we propose a perturbation-guided transfer learning framework for PINNs (PTL-PINN), which integrates perturbation theory with transfer learning to efficiently solve nonlinear equations. Unlike gradient-based transfer learning, PTL-PINNs solve an approximate linear perturbative system using closed-form expressions, enabling rapid generalization with the time complexity of matrix-vector multiplication. We show that PTL-PINNs achieve accuracy comparable to various Runge-Kutta methods, with computational speeds up to one order of magnitude faster. To benchmark performance, we solve a broad set of problems, including nonlinear oscillators across various damping regimes, the equilibrium-centered Lotka-Volterra system, the KPP-Fisher and the Wave equation. Since perturbation theory sets the accuracy bound of PTL-PINNs, we systematically evaluate its practical applicability. This work connects long-standing perturbation methods with PINNs, demonstrating how perturbation theory can guide foundational models to solve nonlinear systems with speeds comparable to those of classical solvers."}

Clinicians interleave information gathering with irreversible actions, guided by regret, constraints and patient values. We argue that the dominant computational substrate of clinician reasoning is not cardinal optimization but ordinal, non-compensatory decision-making: Clinicians frequently rely on fast-and-frugal, lexicographic heuristics (e.g., fast-and-frugal trees) that stop early after checking a small, fixed sequence of cues. We provide a normative rationale for why such algorithms are not merely bounded rationality shortcuts, but can be epistemically preferred in medicine. First, many clinical trade-offs are constructed through human judgment and are only weakly measurable on absolute scales; without strong measurement axioms, only orderings are invariant, motivating an ordinal-by-default stance. Second, preference and signal elicitation are structurally crude: The mapping from truth $\\to$ perception $\\to$ inference $\\to$ recorded variables introduces layered noise, leaving a persistent uncertainty floor. When this 'crudeness' overwhelms the decision margin, plug-in expected-utility optimization becomes brittle (high flip probability under small perturbations), whereas robust dominance/filtering rules ($ε$-dominance, maximin) stabilize decisions.Finally, we outline a clinician-aligned AI blueprint: Use rich models for beliefs and trajectories, but choose actions through robust ordinal rules; treat heuristics as the low-dimensional special case; and deploy AI as 'selective complexity' -- invoked mainly for tie-breaking when decisions are fragile and information has positive expected impact."}

Although large language models (LLMs) perform well on general tasks, they often lack domain-specific knowledge and pedagogical capability to clearly explain complex space science concepts.\n  We introduce SolarGPT-QA, a question answering system based on a domain-adapted large language model built on the LLaMA-3 base model. The model is trained using scientific literature and large-scale question-answer data generated with GPT-4 and refined using Grok-3 in a student-friendly storytelling style. Human pairwise evaluations show that SolarGPT-QA outperforms general-purpose models in zero-shot settings and achieves competitive performance compared to instruction-tuned models for educational explanations in space weather and heliophysics. A small pilot student comprehension study further suggests improved clarity and accessibility of the generated explanations.

To enable non-experts to translate intuitive design intent into manufacturable artifacts, recent large language models-based text-to-CAD efforts focus on command sequences or script-based formats like CadQuery. However, these formats are kernel-dependent and lack universality for manufacturing. In contrast, the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP, ISO 10303) file is a widely adopted, neutral boundary representation (B-rep) format directly compatible with manufacturing, but its graph-structured, cross-referenced nature poses unique challenges for auto-regressive LLMs. To address this, we curate a dataset of ~40K STEP-caption pairs and introduce novel preprocessing tailored for the graph-structured format of STEP, including a depth-first search-based reserialization that linearizes cross-references while preserving locality and chain-of-thought(CoT)-style structural annotations that guide global coherence. We integrate retrieval-augmented generation to ground predictions in relevant examples for supervised fine-tuning, and refine generation quality through reinforcement learning with a specific Chamfer Distance-based geometric reward. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our STEP-LLM in geometric fidelity over the Text2CAD baseline, with improvements arising from multiple stages of our framework: the RAG module substantially enhances completeness and renderability, the DFS-based reserialization strengthens overall accuracy, and the RL further reduces geometric discrepancy. Both metrics and visual comparisons confirm that STEP-LLM generates shapes with higher fidelity than Text2CAD. These results show the feasibility of LLM-driven STEP model generation from natural language, showing its potential to democratize CAD design for manufacturing."}

However, MoE models are plagued by two fundamental challenges: 1) a load imbalance problem known as the``rich get richer\" phenomenon, where a few experts are over-utilized, and 2) an expert homogeneity problem, where experts learn redundant representations, negating their purpose. Current solutions typically employ an auxiliary load-balancing loss that, while mitigating imbalance, often exacerbates homogeneity by enforcing uniform routing at the expense of specialization. To resolve this, we introduce the Eigen-Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel architecture that leverages a routing mechanism based on a learned orthonormal eigenbasis. EMoE projects input tokens onto this shared eigenbasis and routes them based on their alignment with the principal components of the feature space. This principled, geometric partitioning of data intrinsically promotes both balanced expert utilization and the development of diverse, specialized experts, all without the need for a conflicting auxiliary loss function.

This necessitates a focus on energy in space: spacecraft power systems (SPS), especially their health management (HM), given their role in power supply and high failure rates. Providing health management for dozens of SPS and for thousands of SPS represents two fundamentally different paradigms. Therefore, to adapt the health management in the SMC era, this work proposes a principle of aligning underlying capabilities (AUC principle) and develops SpaceHMchat, an open-source Human-AI collaboration (HAIC) framework for all-in-loop health management (AIL HM). SpaceHMchat serves across the entire loop of work condition recognition, anomaly detection, fault localization, and maintenance decision making, achieving goals such as conversational task completion, adaptive human-in-the-loop learning, personnel structure optimization, knowledge sharing, efficiency enhancement, as well as transparent reasoning and improved interpretability. Meanwhile, to validate this exploration, a hardware-realistic fault injection experimental platform is established, and its simulation model is built and open-sourced, both fully replicating the real SPS. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that SpaceHMchat achieves excellent performance across 23 quantitative metrics, such as 100% conclusion accuracy in logical reasoning of work condition recognition, over 99% success rate in anomaly detection tool invocation, over 90% precision in fault localization, and knowledge base search time under 3 minutes in maintenance decision-making.

Specifically, we present a unified monitoring signal and a reward-based classifier to decide when to employ LoRA for deeper factual reconstruction and when to apply TextGrad for token-level edits. Our approach remains memory-efficient by offloading the symbolic transformations to an external LLM only when needed.

In this paper, we revisit this problem in an ultra-sparse sampling regime, where each entry of an unknown, $n\\times d$ matrix $M$ (with $n \\ge d$) is observed independently with probability $p = C / d$, for a fixed integer $C \\ge 2$. This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\\top} M / n$.\n  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance. When the row vectors of $M$ are drawn uniformly from a rank-$r$ factor model satisfying an incoherence condition, we prove that if $n \\ge O({d r^5 ε^{-2} C^{-2} \\log d})$, any local minimum of the gradient-descent objective is approximately global and recovers $T$ with error at most $ε^2$.\n  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data validate our approach.

In this paper, we identify and address the problem of superficial reflection in LRMs. We first propose Self-Critique Fine-Tuning (SCFT), a training framework that enhances the model's reflective reasoning ability using only self-generated critiques. SCFT prompts models to critique their own outputs, filters high-quality critiques through rejection sampling, and fine-tunes the model using a critique-based objective.

Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data.

Current systems assume text-based intent expression, requiring operators to enumerate topologies and parameters in prose. Network practitioners naturally reason about structure through diagrams, yet whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process annotated network sketches into correct optimization code remains unexplored. We present IntentOpt, a benchmark of 85 optimization problems across 17 categories, evaluating four VLMs (GPT-5-Mini, Claude-Haiku-4.5, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision) under three prompting strategies on multimodal versus text-only inputs.

While such approaches achieve interpretable reasoning and strong zero-shot generalization, they assume that intermediate reasoning steps are accurate. However, this assumption causes cascading errors: false detections and invalid relations propagate through the reasoning chain, yielding high-confidence false positives even when no target is present in the image. To address this limitation, we introduce Verification-Integrated Reasoning Operators (VIRO), a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds lightweight operator-level verifiers within reasoning steps.

In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness.

This autonomy introduces serious security risks: malicious instructions or visual prompt injections can trigger unsafe reasoning and cause harmful system-level actions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based blocking, prevent damage but often abort tasks prematurely, reducing agent utility. In this paper, we present MirrorGuard, a plug-and-play defense framework that uses simulation-based training to improve CUA security in the real world. To reduce the cost of large-scale training in operating systems, we propose a novel neural-symbolic simulation pipeline, which generates realistic, high-risk GUI interaction trajectories entirely in a text-based simulated environment, which captures unsafe reasoning patterns and potential system hazards without executing real operations. In the simulation environment, MirrorGuard learns to intercept and rectify insecure reasoning chains of CUAs before they produce and execute unsafe actions. In real-world testing, extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and CUA architectures show that MirrorGuard significantly mitigates security risks. For instance, on the ByteDance UI-TARS system, it reduces the unsafe rate from 66.5% to 13.0% while maintaining a marginal false refusal rate (FRR). In contrast, the state-of-the-art GuardAgent only achieves a reduction to 53.9% and suffers from a 15.4% higher FRR. Our work proves that simulation-derived defenses can provide robust, real-world protection while maintaining the fundamental utility of the agent.

This motivates an investigation into the reasons behind such behavior beyond algorithmic design. In this study, we find that one such reason lies in the distribution shift across training domains. A large degree of distribution shift can lead to better performance even under ERM. Specifically, we derive several theoretical and empirical findings demonstrating that distribution shift plays a crucial role in model learning and benefits learning invariant prediction. Firstly, the proposed upper bounds indicate that the degree of distribution shift directly affects the prediction ability of the learned models. If it is large, the models' ability can increase, approximating invariant prediction models that make stable predictions under arbitrary known or unseen domains; and vice versa. We also prove that, under certain data conditions, ERM solutions can achieve performance comparable to that of invariant prediction models. Secondly, the empirical validation results demonstrated that the predictions of learned models approximate those of Oracle or Optimal models, provided that the degree of distribution shift in the training data increases."}

To promote ordered exploration, this paper introduces SCULPT, a constraint-guided approach for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that integrates domain-aware scoring into selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. SCULPT scores and prunes actions using a combination of symbolic checks (dimensional consistency, type compatibility, magnitude sanity, depth control, and diversity) and structural pattern guidance, thereby steering the search toward plausible reasoning paths. Under matched LLM configurations, SCULPT yields stable improvements on multiple datasets; additional results with GPT-5.2 assess executor transferability and performance on frontier reasoning models. Overall, domain-aware constraints can improve accuracy while maintaining efficiency and reasoning stability."}

Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource. The proposed framework advances epidemic modeling while providing a scalable, low-cost tool for public health planning, early intervention, and urban resilience."}

With the objective to address the need for controlled agent behaviors and to restrict unwanted mental side-effects of actions, we extend the language with a novel causal rule, forbids to cause, along with expressions specialized for mental state dynamics, which enables the modeling of principles for valid transitions between mental states. These principles of mental change are translated into transition constraints, and properties of invariance, which are rigorously evaluated using transition systems in terms of so-called trajectories. This enables controlled reasoning about the dynamic evolution of human mental states.

They are hazardous to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems further downstream. The classical methods of GLOF detection and prediction have so far mainly relied on hydrological modeling, threshold-based lake monitoring, and manual satellite image analysis. These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities."}

During execution, the reward model system identifies erroneous actions, proposes refined alternatives, and continuously enhances agent behavior through an automated data-reflux mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicGUI-RMS yields substantial gains in task accuracy, behavioral robustness. These results establish MagicGUI-RMS as a principled and effective foundation for building self-improving GUI agents driven by reward-based adaptation."}

However, there are risks like hallucinations, toxicity, and stereotypes in their output that make them untrustworthy. We review various risks and vulnerabilities of modern general-purpose AI along eight widely accepted responsible AI (RAI) principles (fairness, privacy, explainability, robustness, safety, truthfulness, governance, and sustainability) and compare how they are non-existent or less severe and easily mitigable in traditional task-specific counterparts. We argue that this is due to the non-deterministically high Degree of Freedom in output (DoFo) of general-purpose AI (unlike the deterministically constant or low DoFo of traditional task-specific AI systems), and there is a need to rethink our approach to RAI for general-purpose AI. Following this, we derive C2V2 (Control, Consistency, Value, Veracity) desiderata to meet the RAI requirements for future general-purpose AI systems, and discuss how recent efforts in AI alignment, retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning enhancements, etc. fare along one or more of the desiderata. We believe that the goal of developing responsible general-purpose AI can be achieved by formally modeling application- or domain-dependent RAI requirements along C2V2 dimensions, and taking a system design approach to suitably combine various techniques to meet the desiderata."}

The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency.

Three deep learning models were developed and compared: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a hybrid CNN with a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To train these models, a data-driven labeling method based on slope ratio analysis was applied to a real oil and gas refinery dataset.

Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively. Its data-efficiency is benchmarked against neural networks on a public mechanical metamaterial dataset with nonlinear stress-strain relations.

In this work, we show that many of these approaches implicitly conflate two fundamental and independent design choices: (i) the sampling geometry, which determines which samples dominate the gradient signal, and (ii) the optimization geometry, which determines how deviations in value are penalized. We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an alpha-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman-divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry. By combining alpha-weighted importance sampling with a chi-square-induced quadratic regularization in ratio coordinates, OPO yields a simple and well-conditioned objective with linear gradient dynamics. This formulation maintains stable optimization while preserving peak-seeking behavior and avoids gradient saturation even when model confidence is high. Our analysis positions OPO as a unifying perspective on existing alignment methods and provides a principled foundation for robust reasoning-oriented training."}

Peptide binder generation is critical in therapeutic and biochemical applications, yet many existing methods rely heavily on intermediate structure prediction, adding complexity and limiting sequence diversity. Our approach departs from this paradigm by generating binder sequences directly in a continuous latent space derived from a pretrained protein embedding model, without relying on predicted structures, thereby improving structural and sequence diversity. To encourage the model to capture binding-relevant features rather than memorizing known sequences, we perform latent-space exploration and diffusion-based sampling, enabling the generation of peptides beyond the limited distribution of known binders. This zero-shot generative strategy leverages the global protein embedding manifold as a semantic prior, allowing the model to propose novel peptide sequences in previously unseen regions of the protein space. We evaluate PepEDiff on TIGIT, a challenging target with a large, flat protein-protein interaction interface that lacks a druggable pocket. Despite its simplicity, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across benchmark tests and in the TIGIT case study, demonstrating its potential as a general, structure-free framework for zero-shot peptide binder design.

Legal reasoning undergoes Crystallization: 45% collapse in representational dimensionality (d95: 501 -> 274), 31% increase in trajectory alignment, and 10x manifold untangling. Scientific and mathematical reasoning remain Liquid - geometrically invariant despite 9x parameter increase. Code reasoning forms a discrete Lattice of strategic modes (silhouette: 0.13 -> 0.42).

However, existing agent frameworks often suffer from architectural rigidity, vendor lock-in, and prohibitive complexity that impedes rapid prototyping and deployment. This paper presents AgentForge, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to democratize the construction of LLM-driven autonomous agents through a principled modular architecture. AgentForge introduces three key innovations: (1) a composable skill abstraction that enables fine-grained task decomposition with formally defined input-output contracts, (2) a unified LLM backend interface supporting seamless switching between cloud-based APIs and local inference engines, and (3) a declarative YAML-based configuration system that separates agent logic from implementation details. We formalize the skill composition mechanism as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and prove its expressiveness for representing arbitrary sequential and parallel task workflows. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four benchmark scenarios demonstrates that AgentForge achieves competitive task completion rates while reducing development time by 62% compared to LangChain and 78% compared to direct API integration. Latency measurements confirm sub-100ms orchestration overhead, rendering the framework suitable for real-time applications. The modular design facilitates extension: we demonstrate the integration of six built-in skills and provide comprehensive documentation for custom skill development. AgentForge addresses a critical gap in the LLM agent ecosystem by providing researchers and practitioners with a production-ready foundation for constructing, evaluating, and deploying autonomous agents without sacrificing flexibility or performance."}

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data. This work proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines. The results highlight the importance of structured temporal representations and show that decoupling local temporal encoding from global attention-based modelling yields more effective and stable time-series forecasting."}

However, prevailing modes of LLM use remain cognitively unstructured: problem framing, knowledge exploration, retrieval, methodological awareness, and explanation are typically collapsed into a single generative process. This cognitive collapse limits traceability, weakens epistemic control, and undermines reproducibility, particularly in high-responsibility settings.\n  We introduce Explicit Cognitive Allocation, a general principle for structuring AI-assisted inference through the explicit separation and orchestration of epistemic functions. We instantiate this principle in the Cognitive Universal Agent (CUA), an architecture that organizes inference into distinct stages of exploration and framing, epistemic anchoring, instrumental and methodological mapping, and interpretive synthesis. Central to this framework is the notion of Universal Cognitive Instruments (UCIs), which formalize heterogeneous means, including computational, experimental, organizational, regulatory, and educational instruments, through which abstract inquiries become investigable.\n  We evaluate the effects of explicit cognitive and instrumental allocation through controlled comparisons between CUA-orchestrated inference and baseline LLM inference under matched execution conditions. Across multiple prompts in the agricultural domain, CUA inference exhibits earlier and structurally governed epistemic convergence, higher epistemic alignment under semantic expansion, and systematic exposure of the instrumental landscape of inquiry. In contrast, baseline LLM inference shows greater variability in alignment and fails to explicitly surface instrumental structure."}

When the total fidelity can be represented as a ratio of two quadratic forms (e.g., in the case of mapping a mixed state to a pure state, projective operators, unitary learning, and others), Semidefinite Programming (SDP) can be applied to solve the fidelity optimization problem with respect to the Choi matrix. A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value. This suggests that a relatively small Kraus rank quantum channel is typically sufficient to describe experimentally observed classical data. The theory was also applied to the problem of reconstructing projective operators from data. Finally, we discuss a classical computational model based on quantum channel transformation, performed and calculated on a classical computer, possibly hardware-optimized."}

We introduce SpatialBench-UC, a small, reproducible benchmark for pairwise spatial relations. The benchmark contains 200 prompts (50 object pairs times 4 relations) grouped into 100 counterfactual pairs obtained by swapping object roles. We release a benchmark package, versioned prompts, pinned configs, per-sample checker outputs, and report tables, enabling reproducible and auditable comparisons across models.

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size.

Here we typically maintain counters in each leaf which allow us to determine the optimal split, and whether the split should be done. In this paper we focus on how to speed up the search for the optimal split when dealing with sparse binary features and a binary class. We focus on finding splits that have the approximately optimal information gain or Gini index. In both cases finding the optimal split can be done in $O(d)$ time, where $d$ is the number of features.

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization ability in emotion analysis tasks, their diagnostic reliability in high-stakes, context-intensive medical settings remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Moreover, existing methods face two key challenges: emotional comorbidity, in which multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these challenges, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis), a framework that systematically explores a broader and finer-grained prompt space to improve diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO formulates instruction refinement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and adopts a multi-agent collaboration mechanism involving Planner, Teacher, Critic, Student, and Target roles. Within this closed-loop framework, the Planner defines an optimization trajectory, while the Teacher-Critic-Student agents iteratively refine prompts to enhance reasoning stability and effectiveness, and the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization based on performance evaluation.

In particular, the image-to-movement model trained with DAgger consistently outperforms heuristic baselines, vector-based approaches, and supervised learning agents, while also demonstrating robustness in sensitivity analyses. These operational gains translate into tangible economic value. In a real-world case study for the Greater Montréal Area (Québec, Canada) using utility cost data, the proposed methods lower system costs by tens of millions of dollars per year over the prevailing practice and show clear potential to delay costly grid upgrades."}

This dependence on manually designed workflows suffers from human biases and makes exploring the broader design space expensive. We introduce AgenticRed, an automated pipeline that leverages LLMs' in-context learning to iteratively design and refine red-teaming systems without human intervention. Rather than optimizing attacker policies within predefined structures, AgenticRed treats red-teaming as a system design problem. Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AgenticRed consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench. Our approach exhibits strong transferability to proprietary models, achieving 100% ASR on GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o-mini, and 60% on Claude-Sonnet-3.5 (24% improvement).

Given that language models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs by integrating reasoning capabilities, we draw on this approach to introduce a latent reasoning mechanism, and experimental validation demonstrates that this mechanism effectively reduces entropy in the model's decision-making process. Based on these findings, we introduce the Entropy-Guided Latent Reasoning (EGLR) recommendation model, which has three core advantages. First, it abandons the \"reason first, recommend later\" paradigm to achieve \"reasoning while recommending\", specifically designed for the high-difficulty nature of list generation by enabling real-time reasoning during generation. Second, it implements entropy-guided variable-length reasoning using context-aware reasoning token alongside dynamic temperature adjustment, expanding exploration breadth in reasoning and boosting exploitation precision in recommending to achieve a more precisely adapted exploration-exploitation trade-off. Third, the model adopts a lightweight integration design with no complex independent modules or post-processing, enabling easy adaptation to existing models. Experimental results on two real-world datasets validate the model's effectiveness, and its notable advantage lies in being compatible with existing generative re-ranking models to enhance their performance. Further analyses also demonstrate its practical deployment value and research potential."}

Iterative refinements of these models have introduced an increasing number of architectural mechanisms, leading to increased complexity and computational costs. Nevertheless, systematic direct comparisons among these models remain limited. Existing benchmark tasks are either too simplistic to reveal substantial differences or excessively resource-intensive for experimentation. In this work, we propose a refined taxonomy of linear recurrent models and introduce SelectivBench, a set of lightweight and customizable synthetic benchmark tasks for systematically evaluating sequence models. SelectivBench specifically evaluates selectivity in sequence models at small to medium scale, such as the capacity to focus on relevant inputs while ignoring context-based distractors. It employs rule-based grammars to generate sequences with adjustable complexity, incorporating irregular gaps that intentionally violate transition rules. Evaluations of linear recurrent models on SelectivBench reveal performance patterns consistent with results from large-scale language tasks. Our analysis clarifies the roles of essential architectural features: gating and rapid forgetting mechanisms facilitate recall, in-state channel mixing is unnecessary for selectivity, but critical for generalization, and softmax attention remains dominant due to its memory capacity scaling with sequence length. Our benchmark enables targeted, efficient exploration of linear recurrent models and provides a controlled setting for studying behaviors observed in large-scale evaluations.

Instead, we propose replacing the softmax with an alternative family of policy parameterizations based on the generalized f-softargmax. We further advocate coupling this parameterization with a regularizer induced by the same f-divergence, which improves the optimization landscape and ensures that the resulting regularized objective satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Leveraging this structure, we establish the first explicit non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees for stochastic policy gradient methods for finite MDPs without any form of preconditioning. We also derive sample-complexity bounds for the unregularized problem and show that f-PG, with Tsallis divergences achieves polynomial sample complexity in contrast to the exponential complexity incurred by the standard softmax parameterization."}

Standard methods combine matrix-vector products with polynomial approximations. We study a different model: access to trace powers $p_k = \\tr(A^k)$, natural when matrix powers are available.\n  Classical moment-based approximations Taylor-expand $\\log(λ)$ around the arithmetic mean. This requires $|λ- \\AM| < \\AM$ and diverges when $κ> 4$. We work instead with the moment-generating function $M(t) = \\E[X^t]$ for normalized eigenvalues $X = λ/\\AM$. Since $M'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$, the log-determinant becomes $\\log\\det(A) = n(\\log \\AM + M'(0))$ -- the problem reduces to estimating a derivative at $t = 0$. Trace powers give $M(k)$ at positive integers, but interpolating $M(t)$ directly is ill-conditioned due to exponential growth. The transform $K(t) = \\log M(t)$ compresses this range. Normalization by $\\AM$ ensures $K(0) = K(1) = 0$. With these anchors fixed, we interpolate $K$ through $m+1$ consecutive integers and differentiate to estimate $K'(0)$. However, this local interpolation cannot capture arbitrary spectral features.\n  We prove a fundamental limit: no continuous estimator using finitely many positive moments can be uniformly accurate over unbounded conditioning. Positive moments downweight the spectral tail; $K'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$ is tail-sensitive. This motivates guaranteed bounds. From the same traces we derive upper bounds on $(\\det A)^{1/n}$. Given a spectral floor $r \\leq λ_{\\min}$, we obtain moment-constrained lower bounds, yielding a provable interval for $\\log\\det(A)$.

Modern AI systems, including LLMs and ViTs, largely operate as sequence-of-behavior prediction machines: they match observable behaviors by modeling token statistics without a persistent, readable mental state. This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly.

We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. We further show that apparent stability depends on the metric: magnitude-based distances can remain near zero while rank-based measures reveal substantial churn in the identity and ordering of top features.

Although most clinical DBS approaches today use a fixed frequency and amplitude, they suffer from side effects (such as slurring of speech) and shortened battery life of the implant. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome. These RL algorithms are, however, too complex to be trained in vivo due to their long convergence time and requirement of high computational resources.\n  We propose a new Time & Threshold-Triggered Multi-Armed Bandit (T3P MAB) RL approach for DBS that is more effective than existing algorithms. Further, our T3P agent is lightweight enough to be deployed in the implant, unlike current deep-RL strategies, and even forgoes the need for an offline training phase. Additionally, most existing RL approaches have focused on modulating only frequency or amplitude, and the possibility of tuning them together remains greatly unexplored in the literature. Our RL agent can tune both frequency and amplitude of DBS signals to the brain with better sample efficiency and requires minimal time to converge. We implement an MAB agent for DBS for the first time on hardware to report energy measurements and prove its suitability for resource-constrained platforms. Our T3P MAB algorithm is deployed on a variety of microcontroller unit (MCU) setups to show its efficiency in terms of power consumption as opposed to other existing RL approaches used in recent work."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) can assess the consistency of small subsets of facts, their judgments are noisy, and pairwise checks are insufficient to guarantee global coherence. We formalize this problem and show that verifying global consistency requires exponentially many oracle queries in the worst case. To make the task practical, we propose an adaptive divide-and-conquer algorithm that identifies minimal inconsistent subsets (MUSes) of facts and optionally computes minimal repairs through hitting-sets. Our approach has low-degree polynomial query complexity. Experiments with both synthetic and real LLM oracles show that our method efficiently detects and localizes inconsistencies, offering a scalable framework for linguistic consistency verification with LLM-based evaluators."}

The traditional static routing strategy most time cannot tolerate the traffic congestion and fluctuating retail demand. In this paper, we propose a Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing(RADR) framework which integrates Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with combinatorial optimization. We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning. We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain. Particularly in the case study of high congestion scenarios, our method reduces the potential congestion risk exposure by 19.3% while only increasing the transportation distance by 2.1%. This empirical evidence confirms that the proposed data-driven approach can effectively balance delivery efficiency and operational safety."}

In real social interaction, ToM is also used for action: a speaker plans what to say in order to shift another person's mental-state trajectory toward a goal. We introduce SocialMindChange, a benchmark that moves from tracking minds to changing minds in social interaction. Each instance defines a social context with 4 characters and five connected scenes. The model plays one character and generates dialogue across the five scenes to reach the target while remaining consistent with the evolving states of all participants. SocialMindChange also includes selected higher-order states. Using a structured four-step framework, we construct 1,200 social contexts, covering 6000 scenarios and over 90,000 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Evaluations on ten state-of-the-art LLMs show that their average performance is 54.2% below human performance.

A wide range of techniques (from classical statistical models to neural network-based approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) have been employed to address time series forecasting challenges. In this paper, we reframe time series forecasting as a two-part task: (1) predicting the trend (directional movement) of the time series at the next time step, and (2) forecasting the quantitative value at the next time step. The trend can be predicted using a binary classifier, while quantitative values can be forecasted using models such as LSTM and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Building on this reframing, we propose the Trend-Adjusted Time Series (TATS) model, which adjusts the forecasted values based on the predicted trend provided by the binary classifier. We validate the proposed approach through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The TATS model is applied to a volatile financial time series (the daily gold price) with the objective of forecasting the next days price. Experimental results demonstrate that TATS consistently outperforms standard LSTM and Bi-LSTM models by achieving significantly lower forecasting error. In addition, our results indicate that commonly used metrics such as MSE and MAE are insufficient for fully assessing time series model performance. Therefore, we also incorporate trend detection accuracy, which measures how effectively a model captures trends in a time series."}

While previous work has shown that LLMs can deceive in controlled tasks, less is known about their ability to deceive using natural language in social contexts. In this paper, we study deception in the Social Deduction Game (SDG) Mafia, where success is dependent on deceiving others through conversation. Unlike previous SDG studies, we use an asynchronous multi-agent framework which better simulates realistic social contexts. We simulate 35 Mafia games with GPT-4o LLM agents. We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research. Our findings underscore both the sophistication and risks of LLM deception in social contexts."}

To tackle this problem, we develop a unified framework for reward function recovery in two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games with entropy regularization, where we aim to reconstruct the underlying reward functions given observed players' strategies and actions. This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of inverse problems, the non-uniqueness of feasible rewards, and limited observational data coverage. To address these challenges, we establish the reward function's identifiability using the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) under linear assumptions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel algorithm to learn reward functions from observed actions. Our algorithm works in both static and dynamic settings and is adaptable to incorporate different methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We provide strong theoretical guarantees for the reliability and sample efficiency of our algorithm. Further, we conduct extensive numerical studies to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed framework, offering new insights into decision-making in competitive environments."}

Dissecting Probabilistic Confidence in Best-of-N Selection", "comment": "15 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Probabilistic confidence metrics are increasingly adopted as proxies for reasoning quality in Best-of-N selection, under the assumption that higher confidence reflects higher reasoning fidelity. In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether these metrics truly capture inter-step causal dependencies necessary for valid reasoning. We introduce three classes of inter-step causality perturbations that systematically disrupt dependencies between reasoning steps while preserving local fluency. Surprisingly, across diverse model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that selection accuracy degrades only marginally under these disruptions. Even severe interventions, such as applying hard attention masks that directly prevent the model from attending to prior reasoning steps, do not substantially reduce selection performance. These findings provide strong evidence that current probabilistic metrics are largely insensitive to logical structure, and primarily capture surface-level fluency or in-distribution priors instead. Motivated by this gap, we propose a contrastive causality metric that explicitly isolates inter-step causal dependencies, and demonstrate that it yields more faithful output selection than existing probability-based approaches."}

With Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), training tends to be exploitation driven: entropy decreases monotonically, samples convergence, and exploration fades. Most existing fixes are \\textbf{sample-centric}: they seek or bonus rare samples, assuming exploration comes from novel trajectories and tokens. These heuristics depend on the \"luck\" of informative samples, lack principled control of the policy, and often yield limited or inconsistent gains. In this work, we are the first to introduce a \\textbf{distribution-centric} perspective for RL, in which exploration is always guided by a \"better\" target distribution, and reveal that a policy's ability to resist entropy collapse is governed by the distribution itself rather than individual samples. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Centric Policy Optimization (DCPO), which reformulates entropy regulation as distribution-level regularization. DCPO achieves controllable entropy fully on-policy without sampling from external distributions, enabling efficient exploration while maintaining training stability. Across multiple models and seven benchmarks, DCPO improves over GRPO by about 20\\% on average. Overall, DCPO replaces sample-level heuristics with distribution-level principles, offering a theoretically grounded and flexible framework for controllable exploration and a stronger EE trade-off.

Current methods for shaping LRM behavior typically rely on reinforcement learning or fine-tuning with gold-standard reasoning traces, a paradigm that is both computationally expensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we reveal that LRMs possess latent \\textit{reasoning beliefs} that internally track their own reasoning traits, which can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, we propose Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF), a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reflective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief. Extensive experiments on efficiency and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that RELIEF matches or outperforms behavior-supervised and preference-based baselines while requiring lower training costs. Further analysis validates that shifting a model's reasoning belief effectively shapes its actual behavior."}

Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning \"pre-training\" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a \"graph prompting-fine-tuning\" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning.

To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models.

While instruction tuning is the prevailing method for adapting pre-trained LLMs to graph learning tasks like node classification, it requires a substantial volume of annotated (INSTRUCTION, OUTPUT) pairs deriving from labeled nodes. This requirement is particularly prohibitive in the social domain, where obtaining expert labels for sensitive or evolving content is costly and slow. Furthermore, standard graph instruction tuning fails to exploit the vast amount of unlabeled nodes, which contain latent correlations due to edge connections that are beneficial for downstream predictions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Instruction Tuning pipeline for Graph Learning, named SIT-Graph. Notably, SIT-Graph is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into any graph instruction tuning method that utilizes LLMs as the predictor. SIT-Graph operates via an iterative self-training process. Initially, the model is fine-tuned using instruction pairs constructed solely from the labeled nodes. Then it generates confidence-filtered pseudo-responses for unlabeled nodes to strategically augment the dataset for the next round of fine-tuning. Finally, this iterative refinement progressively aligns the LLM with the underlying node correlations.

However, their reliance on language material alone limits their ability to adapt, verify reasoning outcomes, and operate effectively in open and dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose Human Simulation Computation (HSC), a human-inspired computational framework that models intelligence as a continuous, closed-loop process involving thinking, action, learning, reflection, and activity scheduling, collectively referred to as the internal reasoning process. HSC emphasizes active participation both within the internal reasoning process and in interactions with the environment, where actions are used not only to achieve goals but also to automatically refine and improve internal reasoning mechanisms without external intervention. Furthermore, HSC incorporates commonly used human thinking strategies across all stages of the internal reasoning process, such as main-feature-oriented reasoning, scope expansion through action, and on-time learning driven by environmental feedback. Through theoretical analysis, we argue that human simulation strategies cannot be fully learned from language material alone, and that human-like reasoning processes and action-grounded reasoning methods are essential for robust adaptation and effective interaction with real-world environments."}

Unlike existing methods that operate in Euclidean parameter space, FOPNG projects gradients onto the Fisher-orthogonal complement of previous task gradients. This approach unifies natural gradient descent with orthogonal gradient methods within an information-geometric framework. The resulting update direction is invariant under reparameterization, guarantees descent in the Fisher metric, and helps preserve prior task outputs. We provide theoretical analysis establishing the properties of the projected update, describe efficient and practical implementations using the diagonal Fisher, and demonstrate strong results on standard continual learning benchmarks such as Permuted-MNIST, Split-MNIST, Rotated-MNIST, Split-CIFAR10, and Split-CIFAR100."}

Existing methods typically rely on full annotation, requiring users to continuously label affective states across entire sessions. While this process yields fine-grained data, it is time-consuming, cognitively demanding, and prone to fatigue and errors. To address these issues, we present PREFAB, a low-budget retrospective self-annotation method that targets affective inflection regions rather than full annotation. Grounded in the peak-end rule and ordinal representations of emotion, PREFAB employs a preference-learning model to detect relative affective changes, directing annotators to label only selected segments while interpolating the remainder of the stimulus. We further introduce a preview mechanism that provides brief contextual cues to assist annotation. We evaluate PREFAB through a technical performance study and a 25-participant user study. Results show that PREFAB outperforms baselines in modeling affective inflections while mitigating workload (and conditionally mitigating temporal burden). Importantly PREFAB improves annotator confidence without degrading annotation quality."}

We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods.

From subcellular chemical networks to swarms of organisms, and across evolved, engineered, and chimeric systems, it is hypothesized that scale-invariant principles of decision-making can be discovered. We propose that cognition in both natural and synthetic systems can be characterized and understood by the interplay between two equally important invariants: (1) the remapping of embedding spaces, and (2) the navigation within these spaces. Biological collectives, from single cells to entire organisms (and beyond), remap transcriptional, morphological, physiological, or 3D spaces to maintain homeostasis and regenerate structure, while navigating these spaces through distributed error correction. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, including transformers, diffusion models, and neural cellular automata enact analogous processes by remapping data into latent embeddings and refining them iteratively through contextualization. We argue that this dual principle - remapping and navigation of embedding spaces via iterative error minimization - constitutes a substrate-independent invariant of cognition. Recognizing this shared mechanism not only illuminates deep parallels between living systems and artificial models, but also provides a unifying framework for engineering adaptive intelligence across scales."}

In such systems, evaluating long-run performance measures typically relies on costly simulation.\n  This paper proposes a supervised learning framework via a neural network model for approximating stationary performance measures of (s,S) inventory systems with general distributions for the interarrival time between demands and lead times under lost sales. Simulations are first used to generate training labels, after which the neural network is trained. After training, the neural network provides almost instantaneous predictions of various metrics of the system, such as the stationary distribution of inventory levels, the expected cycle time, and the probability of lost sales. We find that using a small number of low-order moments of the distributions as input is sufficient to train the neural networks and to accurately capture the steady-state distribution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy over a wide range of system parameters. As such, it effectively replaces repeated and costly simulation runs. Our framework is easily extendable to other inventory models, offering an efficient and fast alternative for analyzing complex stochastic systems."}

This paper therefore investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latency, tokens, steps, etc. Aimed at conducting comprehensive research addressing the efficiency of the agentic system itself, we review a broad range of recent approaches that differ in implementation yet frequently converge on shared high-level principles including but not limited to bounding context via compression and management, designing reinforcement learning rewards to minimize tool invocation, and employing controlled search mechanisms to enhance efficiency, which we discuss in detail. Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies.

It has a high global prevalence and places a significant burden on healthcare systems, especially in resource-limited regions. Automated classification of sickle cells in blood images is crucial, allowing the specialist to reduce the effort required and avoid errors when quantifying the deformed cells and assessing the severity of a crisis. Recent studies have proposed various erythrocyte representation and classification methods. Since classification depends solely on cell shape, a suitable approach models erythrocytes as closed planar curves in shape space. This approach employs elastic distances between shapes, which are invariant under rotations, translations, scaling, and reparameterizations, ensuring consistent distance measurements regardless of the curves' position, starting point, or traversal speed. While previous methods exploiting shape space distances had achieved high accuracy, we refined the model by considering the geometric characteristics of healthy and sickled erythrocytes. Our method proposes (1) to employ a fixed parameterization based on the major axis of each cell to compute distances and (2) to align each cell with two templates using this parameterization before computing distances. Aligning shapes to templates before distance computation, a concept successfully applied in areas such as molecular dynamics, and using a fixed parameterization, instead of minimizing distances across all possible parameterizations, simplifies calculations. This strategy achieves 96.03\\% accuracy rate in both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering.

Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality. Then, we show that using a Student's t likelihood in addition to natural gradient induces a bounded update, which improves robustness to outliers.

While the effectiveness of these models can be theoretically explained using differential equations related to the sampling process, previous work by Song and Ermon (2020) demonstrated that neural networks using multiplicative noise conditioning can still generate satisfactory samples. In this setup, the model is expressed as the product of two functions: one depending on the spatial variable and the other on the noise magnitude. This structure limits the model's ability to represent a more general relationship between the spatial variable and the noise, indicating that it cannot fully learn the correct score. Despite this limitation, the models perform well in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by studying the deterministic dynamics of the associated differential equations, offering insight into how the model operates."}

This densifies supervision across the preference simplex without altering the CAPQL architecture or loss functions.

In this work, we study PINN training from a unified architecture-optimization perspective. We first propose a layer-wise dynamic attention mechanism to enhance representational flexibility, resulting in the Layer-wise Dynamic Attention PINN (LDA-PINN). We then reformulate PINN training as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a conflict-resolved gradient update strategy to alleviate gradient interference, leading to the Gradient-Conflict-Resolved PINN (GC-PINN). By integrating these two components, we develop the Architecture-Conflict-Resolved PINN (ACR-PINN), which combines attentive representations with conflict-aware optimization while preserving the standard PINN loss formulation. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers, Helmholtz, Klein-Gordon, and lid-driven cavity flow problems, demonstrate that ACR-PINN achieves faster convergence and significantly lower relative $L_2$ and $L_\\infty$ errors than standard PINNs.

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance."}

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has therefore spurred interest in autonomous agents that can read scientific papers and extract task-relevant information. However, most existing approaches rely either on heavily engineered prompting or on a conventional SFT-RL training pipeline, both of which often lead to excessive and low-yield exploration. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we propose PaperCompass, a framework that mitigates these issues by separating high-level planning from fine-grained execution. PaperCompass first drafts an explicit plan that outlines the intended sequence of actions, and then performs detailed reasoning to instantiate each step by selecting the parameters for the corresponding function calls. To train such behavior, we introduce Draft-and-Follow Policy Optimization (DFPO), a tailored RL method that jointly optimizes both the draft plan and the final solution. DFPO can be viewed as a lightweight form of hierarchical reinforcement learning, aimed at narrowing the `knowing-doing' gap in LLMs. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes DFPO's favorable optimization properties, supporting a stable and reliable training process. Experiments on paper-based question answering (Paper-QA) benchmarks show that PaperCompass improves efficiency over strong baselines without sacrificing performance, achieving results comparable to much larger models."}

Probe families induce an operational equivalence relation on kernels and therefore a gauge; anchors select representatives relative to that probe. Under a scalar relational-work representation and a multiplicative compositionality law for evidence, the admissible link family is exponential, yielding Gibbs weights; with row anchoring this includes the softmax kernel family as a subregime. After quotienting unary row/column score fields, the remaining interaction component admits a canonical rank-r normal form (Eckart-Young/SVD); dot-product score charts implement the corresponding low-rank interaction regime. Fixing the carrier and extensionalizing the update yields the standard fixed-token Transformer attention operator; allowing carrier updates yields adaptive-carrier and staged-depth regimes. The operator language also supports multihead/mixed kernels, plan-based anchors (e.g., entropic OT/Sinkhorn), and unary operators (e.g., FFN-style fields) as explicit regime choices.

This increased training/inference cost paved the way for efficient model size reduction/parametric reduction deploying Sparse Attention techniques. In this paper, we start analyzing one of the techniques of Sparse Attention called Symmetric Dot-Product Attention (referred to as Symmetric Attention) and propose a novel unified model architecture called Noise Diffused Symmetric Attention Transformer to enhance the model's performance.

A common strategy is to isolate updates by routing inputs to different LoRA experts. However, existing LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods often jointly update the router and experts in an indiscriminate way, causing the router's preferences to co-drift with experts' adaptation pathways and gradually deviate from early-stage input-expert specialization. We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks. Experiments on a CIT benchmark show that our approach consistently outperforms a range of conventional continual learning baselines and MoE-LoRA variants in both accuracy and anti-forgetting without adding parameters.

Analysis reveals that kernels display anti-clustering behavior, evolving into a learned \"active filtration\" strategy distinct from traditional h- or p-adaptivity. Effective receptive field analysis confirms that D-PARC autonomously concentrates resources in high-strain regions while coarsening focus elsewhere, mirroring adaptive refinement in computational mechanics. This demonstrates that physically intuitive architectural design can outperform parameter scaling, establishing that strategic learning in lean networks offers a more effective path forward for PADL than indiscriminate network expansion."}

Two dominant paradigms have emerged: activation-aware methods such as AWQ prioritize channels with large activation magnitudes, while second-order methods such as GPTQ allocate quantization error according to input covariance structure. Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we show that sensitivity naturally arises as the squared norm of gradient-weighted activations, yielding a principled measure of channel importance that captures both activation magnitude and downstream error propagation. Within this framework, AWQ and GPTQ can be interpreted as complementary approximations that recover sensitivity under distinct simplifying assumptions. We analyze the design space of sensitivity metrics, connect gradient-based saliency, Fisher information, and Hessian-based criteria, and clarify their relationships to classical pruning methods such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon. Rather than proposing a new quantization algorithm, this work provides a conceptual foundation for understanding and comparing post-training quantization methods through the lens of sensitivity."}

We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task. This yields a task-specific hybrid model in a single efficient pass, without costly re-training or neural architecture search, and can be applied to any pretrained full-attention backbone for diverse downstream tasks."}

The proposed four-layer architecture leverages low-cost hardware, an ESP32 microcontroller as an edge inference node, and a Raspberry Pi as a local edge server to enable autonomous decision-making without cloud dependency. The system utilizes capacitive soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH, and ambient light sensors for environmental monitoring.

In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

While token pruning has been actively explored in standard large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (LVLMs), its application to AV-LLMs has received little attention, even though multimodal integration substantially increases their token demands. To address this gap, we introduce a pruning strategy that utilizes attention weights to identify tokens emphasized at different stages and estimates their importance. Building on this analysis, FastAV applies a two-stage pruning strategy: (1) global pruning in intermediate layers to remove broadly less influential tokens, and (2) fine pruning in later layers considering the impact on next token generation. Notably, our method does not rely on full attention maps, which makes it fully compatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastAV reduces FLOPs by more than 40% on two representative AV-LLMs, while preserving or even improving model performance."}

We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms.\n  Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse. Together, these findings establish training stability as a measurable and comparable dynamical property of learning systems, providing a descriptive foundation for studying learning dynamics beyond final performance outcomes."}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation. Our findings suggest that MoE-Encoder provides a scalable and privacy-aware extension to foundation time series models."}

In zero-shot CoT settings on GSM8K, base models consistently outperform instruction-tuned variants, with drops as high as 32.67\\% (Llama3-70B). Instruction-tuned models only match or exceed this performance when provided with few-shot exemplars, suggesting a reliance on specific prompting patterns rather than intrinsic reasoning. Second, tuning gains are brittle under distribution shift. Our results show that base models surpass instruction-tuned variants on the domain-specific MedCalc benchmark. Additionally, instruction-tuned models show sharp declines on perturbed datasets, indicating sensitivity to prompt structure over robust reasoning."}

Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data.

We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features.

We show that while RLVR improves task performance, it produces extremely overconfident models, whereas SFT yields substantially better calibration, even under distribution shift, though with smaller performance gains. Through targeted experiments, we diagnose RLVR's failure, showing that decision tokens act as extraction steps of the decision in reasoning traces and do not carry confidence information, which prevents reinforcement learning from surfacing calibrated alternatives. Based on this insight, we propose a calibration-aware reinforcement learning formulation that directly adjusts decision-token probabilities.

To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation.

The classical methods of GLOF detection and prediction have so far mainly relied on hydrological modeling, threshold-based lake monitoring, and manual satellite image analysis. These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection.

Despite their shared temporal structure, they differ fundamentally in the nature of their latent states, probabilistic assumptions, inference procedures, and training paradigms. Recently, deterministic state space models have re-emerged in natural language processing through architectures such as S4 and Mamba, raising new questions about the relationship between classical probabilistic SSMs, HMMs, and modern neural sequence models.\n  In this paper, we present a unified and systematic comparison of HMMs, linear Gaussian state space models, Kalman filtering, and contemporary NLP state space models. We analyze their formulations through the lens of probabilistic graphical models, examine their inference algorithms -- including forward-backward inference and Kalman filtering -- and contrast their learning procedures via Expectation-Maximization and gradient-based optimization. By highlighting both structural similarities and semantic differences, we clarify when these models are equivalent, when they fundamentally diverge, and how modern NLP SSMs relate to classical probabilistic models. Our analysis bridges perspectives from control theory, probabilistic modeling, and modern deep learning."}

In this work, we show that many of these approaches implicitly conflate two fundamental and independent design choices: (i) the sampling geometry, which determines which samples dominate the gradient signal, and (ii) the optimization geometry, which determines how deviations in value are penalized. We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an alpha-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman-divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry. By combining alpha-weighted importance sampling with a chi-square-induced quadratic regularization in ratio coordinates, OPO yields a simple and well-conditioned objective with linear gradient dynamics. This formulation maintains stable optimization while preserving peak-seeking behavior and avoids gradient saturation even when model confidence is high. Our analysis positions OPO as a unifying perspective on existing alignment methods and provides a principled foundation for robust reasoning-oriented training."}

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction.

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data. This work proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines. The results highlight the importance of structured temporal representations and show that decoupling local temporal encoding from global attention-based modelling yields more effective and stable time-series forecasting."}

The proposed method leverages a continuous signed distance function (SDF) representation to reconstruct and generate smooth, watertight geometries with quantified accuracy. It establishes an interpretable, near-Gaussian latent space that aligns with blade-relevant parameters, such as taper and chord ratios, enabling controlled exploration and unconditional synthesis through interpolation and Gaussian sampling.

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size. We also extend these results to general Markov Cooperative Games to find an agent-wise local maximum. Empirically, we test the base policy prediction algorithm in both simulated games and MAPPO for complex environments."}

In this paper, we present BADR, a simple framework to recover the optimal Pareto-efficient model for any fairness metric. Our framework recovers its models through a Bilevel Adaptive Rescalarisation procedure. The lower level is a weighted empirical risk minimization task where the weights are a convex combination of the groups, while the upper level optimizes the chosen fairness objective.

We term this phenomenon explanation multiplicity: multiple internally valid but substantively different explanations for the same decision. We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. We further show that apparent stability depends on the metric: magnitude-based distances can remain near zero while rank-based measures reveal substantial churn in the identity and ordering of top features. To contextualize observed disagreement, we derive randomized baseline values under plausible null models. Across datasets, model classes, and confidence regimes, we find explanation multiplicity is pervasive and persists even for high-confidence predictions, highlighting the need for metrics and baselines that match the intended use of explanations."}

We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam.

To address these gaps, we develop a novel PRobabilistic variational imputation framework that leverages the power of large lAnguage models and retrIeval-augmented Memory (PRAIM). PRAIM employs a pre-trained language model to encode heterogeneous data, spanning time-series demand, calendar features, and geospatial context, into a unified, semantically rich representation. This is dynamically fortified by retrieval-augmented memory that retrieves relevant examples from the entire charging network, enabling a single, unified imputation model empowered by variational neural architecture to overcome data sparsity. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that PRAIM significantly outperforms established baselines in both imputation accuracy and its ability to preserve the original data's statistical distribution, leading to substantial improvements in downstream forecasting performance."}

While knowledge distillation offers a natural and effective approach for model compression, techniques developed for general machine learning tasks are not directly applicable to time series forecasting due to the unique characteristics. To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x.

In this work, we propose a stochastic alternating minimization algorithm that operates directly on the core tensor and factor matrices under a Tucker factorization. The proposed method avoids repeated tensor projections and enables efficient mini-batch updates on low-dimensional tensor factors.

To address these limitations, we propose MN-TSG, a novel framework that explores Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based NCDEs and integrates them with existing TSG models for irregular and continuous generation tasks.\n  The core of MN-TSG lies in a MoE-NCDE architecture with dynamically parameterized expert functions and a decoupled design that facilitates more effective optimization of MoE dynamics. Furthermore, we leverage existing TSG models to learn the joint distribution over the mixture of experts and the generated time series. This enables the framework not only to generate new samples, but also to produce appropriate expert configurations tailored to each sample, thereby supporting refined continuous TSG.\n  Extensive experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MN-TSG, consistently outperforming strong TSG baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous generation tasks."}

Inverting this linear response relationship yields the data intervention that steers the model toward a target internal configuration. We demonstrate patterning in a small language model, showing that re-weighting training data along principal susceptibility directions can accelerate or delay the formation of structure, such as the induction circuit. In a synthetic parentheses balancing task where multiple algorithms achieve perfect training accuracy, we show that patterning can select which algorithm the model learns by targeting the local learning coefficient of each solution.

This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Diversity among experts arises from viewing different angles of shared capacity, not from redundant storage. By applying learned rotations to a shared ternary prototype, each expert yields $\\mathcal{O}(d^2 + N \\cdot d \\log d)$ memory -- sub-linear in the number of experts. The key insight: training these rotations with quantization reduces activation outliers and stabilizes extreme low bit training, where static methods collapse.

Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications. Overall, these results establish LUMOS as a data-physics dual-driven framework for general fluorophore inverse design."}

Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality. Then, we show that using a Student's t likelihood in addition to natural gradient induces a bounded update, which improves robustness to outliers.

This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks.

A common strategy is to isolate updates by routing inputs to different LoRA experts.

We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks.

By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism.

In this setting, model merging offers a practical mechanism for integrating multiple RL-trained agents from different tasks into a single generalist model. However, existing merging methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and they are suboptimal to preserve task-specific capabilities on RL-trained agentic models. The root is a task-vector mismatch between RL and SFT: on-policy RL induces task vectors that are highly sparse and heterogeneous, whereas SFT-style merging implicitly assumes dense and globally comparable task vectors. When standard global averaging is applied under this mismatch, RL's non-overlapping task vectors that encode critical task-specific behaviors are reduced and parameter updates are diluted. To address this issue, we propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware merging framework explicitly designed for RL-trained agentic models. RAM disentangles shared and task-specific unique parameter updates, averaging shared components while selectively preserving and rescaling unique ones to counteract parameter update dilution. Experiments across multiple agent domains and model architectures demonstrate that RAM not only surpasses merging baselines, but also unlocks synergistic potential among agents to achieve performance superior to that of specialized agents in their domains."}

The proposed four-layer architecture leverages low-cost hardware, an ESP32 microcontroller as an edge inference node, and a Raspberry Pi as a local edge server to enable autonomous decision-making without cloud dependency. The system utilizes capacitive soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH, and ambient light sensors for environmental monitoring.

Local communication is facilitated by an MQTT-based LAN protocol, ensuring reliable operation in areas with limited or no internet connectivity.

We evaluate METIS against GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 across six writing stages using LLM-as-a-judge pairwise preferences, student-persona rubrics, short multi-turn tutoring, and evidence/compliance checks. On 90 single-turn prompts, LLM judges preferred METIS to Claude Sonnet 4.5 in 71% and to GPT-5 in 54%. Student scores (clarity/actionability/constraint-fit; 90 prompts x 3 judges) are higher across stages. In multi-turn sessions (five scenarios/agent), METIS yields slightly higher final quality than GPT-5. Gains concentrate in document-grounded stages (D-F), consistent with stage-aware routing and groundings failure modes include premature tool routing, shallow grounding, and occasional stage misclassification."}

Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that tightly couple trained parameters to specific model instances and training data, NOT extracts contiguous layer subsets (\"donor organs\") from pre-trained models, trains them independently on domain-specific data, and saves them as standalone checkpoint files that can be transplanted into compatible recipient models without access to the original training data. Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution. We note that this approach is currently limited to decoder-only models; preliminary experiments on encoder-based architectures show reduced effectiveness."}

Training unfolds as a high-dimensional dynamical system in which small perturbations to optimization, data, parameters, or learning signals can induce abrupt and irreversible collapse, undermining reproducibility and scalability.\n  We propose a unified dynamical perspective that characterizes training stability as an intrinsic property of learning systems, organized along four interacting dimensions: optimization, environmental/data, parametric, and learning-signal stability. We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms.\n  Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse. Together, these findings establish training stability as a measurable and comparable dynamical property of learning systems, providing a descriptive foundation for studying learning dynamics beyond final performance outcomes."}

One solution is to use machine learning methods to simulate the radiation process to improve computational efficiency. From an operational standpoint, this study investigates critical limitations inherent to hybrid forecasting frameworks that embed deep neural networks into numerical prediction models, with a specific focus on two fundamental bottlenecks: coupling compatibility and long-term integration stability. A residual convolutional neural network is employed to approximate the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) within the global operational system of China Meteorological Administration. We adopted an offline training and online coupling approach. First, a comprehensive dataset is generated through model simulations, encompassing all atmospheric columns both with and without cloud cover. To ensure the stability of the hybrid model, the dataset is enhanced via experience replay, and additional output constraints based on physical significance are imposed. Meanwhile, a LibTorch-based coupling method is utilized, which is more suitable for real-time operational computations. The hybrid model is capable of performing ten-day integrated forecasts as required. A two-month operational reforecast experiment demonstrates that the machine learning emulator achieves accuracy comparable to that of the traditional physical scheme, while accelerating the computation speed by approximately eightfold."}

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence."}

Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field. We utilise snapshot confidence remasking to identify the most critical tokens that require modification, and apply mix-scale training to expand the block diffusion model's global capabilities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark for discrete diffusion models on the OpenWebText dataset.

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We implement and evaluate our TrustEnergy framework by working with an electricity provider in Florida, and the results show our TrustEnergy can achieve a 5.4% increase in prediction accuracy and 5.7% improvement in uncertainty quantification compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior. Our theory formalizes the preconditioning effect induced by spectral orthogonalization, offering insight into Muon's effectiveness in these matrix optimization problems and potentially beyond."}

However, traditional numerical solvers often fall short in meeting real-time performance requirements. To overcome this, we introduce a deep learning-based surrogate model that efficiently simulates transient brain deformation caused by continuous interactions between surgical instruments and the virtual brain geometry. Building on Universal Physics Transformers, our approach operates directly on large-scale mesh data and is trained on an extensive dataset generated from nonlinear finite element simulations, covering a broad spectrum of temporal instrument-tissue interaction scenarios. To reduce the accumulation of errors in autoregressive inference, we propose a stochastic teacher forcing strategy applied during model training. Specifically, training consists of short stochastic rollouts in which the proportion of ground truth inputs is gradually decreased in favor of model-generated predictions. Our results show that the proposed surrogate model achieves accurate and efficient predictions across a range of transient brain deformation scenarios, scaling to meshes with up to 150,000 nodes. The introduced stochastic teacher forcing technique substantially improves long-term rollout stability, reducing the maximum prediction error from 6.7 mm to 3.5 mm. We further integrate the trained surrogate model into an interactive neurosurgical simulation environment, achieving runtimes below 10 ms per simulation step on consumer-grade inference hardware. Our proposed deep learning framework enables rapid, smooth and accurate biomechanical simulations of dynamic brain tissue deformation, laying the foundation for realistic surgical training environments."}

To address these gaps, we develop a novel PRobabilistic variational imputation framework that leverages the power of large lAnguage models and retrIeval-augmented Memory (PRAIM). PRAIM employs a pre-trained language model to encode heterogeneous data, spanning time-series demand, calendar features, and geospatial context, into a unified, semantically rich representation. This is dynamically fortified by retrieval-augmented memory that retrieves relevant examples from the entire charging network, enabling a single, unified imputation model empowered by variational neural architecture to overcome data sparsity. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that PRAIM significantly outperforms established baselines in both imputation accuracy and its ability to preserve the original data's statistical distribution, leading to substantial improvements in downstream forecasting performance."}

In a prospectively collected cohort where all patients underwent surgery, we ask whether models using only pre-operative clinical data could have identified those who would have poor outcomes, i.e. those who should have avoided surgery. We benchmark supervised ML (logistic regression, tree ensembles, and an in-house MLP) against generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity), giving each the same structured inputs and constraining outputs to binary recommendations with confidence. Our best ML model (MLP) achieves 85 % accuracy with superior calibration and decision-curve net benefit. GenAI models underperform on discrimination and calibration across zero-shot setting. Notably, GenAI justifications align with clinician heuristics and the MLP's feature importance, repeatedly highlighting baseline SNOT-22, CT/endoscopy severity, polyp phenotype, and physchology/pain comorbidities.

LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization.

By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism.

Inspired by latent diffusion in other modalities, a natural idea is to compress graphs into a low-dimensional latent space and perform diffusion there. However, unlike images or text, graph generation requires nearly lossless reconstruction, as even a single error in decoding an adjacency matrix can render the entire sample invalid. This challenge has remained largely unaddressed. We propose LG-Flow, a latent graph diffusion framework that directly overcomes these obstacles. A permutation-equivariant autoencoder maps each node into a fixed-dimensional embedding from which the full adjacency is provably recoverable, enabling near-lossless reconstruction for both undirected graphs and DAGs. The dimensionality of this latent representation scales linearly with the number of nodes, eliminating the quadratic bottleneck and making it feasible to train larger and more expressive models. In this latent space, we train a Diffusion Transformer with flow matching, enabling efficient and expressive graph generation. Our approach achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art graph diffusion models, while achieving up to $1000\\times$ speed-up."}

Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that tightly couple trained parameters to specific model instances and training data, NOT extracts contiguous layer subsets (\"donor organs\") from pre-trained models, trains them independently on domain-specific data, and saves them as standalone checkpoint files that can be transplanted into compatible recipient models without access to the original training data. Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution. We note that this approach is currently limited to decoder-only models; preliminary experiments on encoder-based architectures show reduced effectiveness."}

As autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems become increasingly prevalent, the need for accurate and reliable ETA estimation has grown, playing a vital role in navigation, mobility planning, and traffic management. However, predicting ETA remains a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of traffic flow. Traditional methods often combine real-time and historical traffic data in simplistic ways, or rely on complex rule-based computations. While recent deep learning models have shown potential, they often require high computational costs and do not effectively capture the spatio-temporal patterns crucial for ETA prediction. ETA prediction inherently involves spatio-temporal causality, and our proposed model addresses this by leveraging attention mechanisms to extract and utilize temporal features accumulated at each spatio-temporal point along a route. This architecture enables efficient and accurate ETA estimation while keeping the model lightweight and scalable. We validate our approach using real-world driving datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by effectively integrating road characteristics, real-time traffic conditions, and historical speed patterns in a task-aware manner."}

A residual convolutional neural network is employed to approximate the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) within the global operational system of China Meteorological Administration. We adopted an offline training and online coupling approach. First, a comprehensive dataset is generated through model simulations, encompassing all atmospheric columns both with and without cloud cover. To ensure the stability of the hybrid model, the dataset is enhanced via experience replay, and additional output constraints based on physical significance are imposed. Meanwhile, a LibTorch-based coupling method is utilized, which is more suitable for real-time operational computations. The hybrid model is capable of performing ten-day integrated forecasts as required. A two-month operational reforecast experiment demonstrates that the machine learning emulator achieves accuracy comparable to that of the traditional physical scheme, while accelerating the computation speed by approximately eightfold."}

ELSA introduces three key innovations. First, it employs a task-agnostic, behavior-aware client clustering mechanism that constructs semantic fingerprints using public probe inputs and symmetric KL divergence, further enhanced by prediction-consistency-based trust scoring and latency-aware edge assignment to jointly address data heterogeneity, client unreliability, and communication constraints. Second, it splits the LLM into three parts across clients and edge servers, with the cloud used only for adapter aggregation, enabling an effective balance between on-device computation cost and global convergence stability. Third, it incorporates a lightweight communication scheme based on computational sketches combined with semantic subspace orthogonal perturbation (SS-OP) to reduce communication overhead while mitigating privacy leakage during model exchanges.

Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field. We utilise snapshot confidence remasking to identify the most critical tokens that require modification, and apply mix-scale training to expand the block diffusion model's global capabilities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark for discrete diffusion models on the OpenWebText dataset.

To our knowledge, this is the first such result in theoretical continual learning. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through experiments on linear regression and neural networks, illustrating how this scaling law affects generalization and offering a practical recipe for the design of continual learning systems."}

In this work, we show that the activation pattern of a SOM - the squared distances to its prototypes - can be inverted to recover the exact input under mild geometric conditions. This follows from a classical fact in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which the inversion is well-posed. Building upon this mechanism, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control (MUSIC) update rule, which enables controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories in latent space. MUSIC modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, resulting in a deterministic geometric flow aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update rule and ensures smooth motion on high-dimensional datasets. Unlike variational or probabilistic generative models, MUSIC does not rely on sampling, latent priors, or encoder-decoder architectures. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target cluster or prototype is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic variations while remaining on the data manifold. This leads to a new perspective on data augmentation and controllable latent exploration based solely on prototype geometry. We validate the approach using synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the MNIST and the Faces in the Wild dataset. Across all settings, MUSIC produces smooth, interpretable trajectories that reveal the underlying geometry of the learned manifold, illustrating the advantages of SOM-based inversion over unsupervised clustering."}

In this paper, we close this gap by leveraging LLMs as surrogate models and candidate samplers inside a structured hierarchical search strategy. By adaptively partitioning the input space into disjoint hyperrectangular regions and ranking them with a composite score function, we restrict the generative process of the LLM to specific, high-potential sub-spaces, hence making the problem easier to solve as the LLM doesn't have to reason about the global structure of the problem, but only locally instead. We show that under standard regularity assumptions, our algorithm generates candidate solutions that converge to the true Pareto set in Hausdorff distance.

Although traditional methods relied mainly on classical deterministic and probabilistic approaches, recent progress has benefited from supervised deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to improve tract reconstruction. A persistent challenge in tractography is accurately reconstructing white matter tracts while minimizing spurious connections. To address this, we propose TractRLFusion, a novel GPT-based policy fusion framework that integrates multiple RL policies through a data-driven fusion strategy. Our method employs a two-stage training data selection process for effective policy fusion, followed by a multi-critic fine-tuning phase to enhance robustness and generalization.

We introduce Linearized Subspace Refinement (LSR), a general and architecture-agnostic framework that exploits the Jacobian-induced linear residual model at a fixed trained network state. By solving a reduced direct least-squares problem within this subspace, LSR computes a subspace-optimal solution of the linearized residual model, yielding a refined linear predictor with substantially improved accuracy over standard gradient-trained solutions, without modifying network architectures, loss formulations, or training procedures. Across supervised function approximation, data-driven operator learning, and physics-informed operator fine-tuning, we show that gradient-based training often fails to access this attainable accuracy, even when local linearization yields a convex problem. This observation indicates that loss-induced numerical ill-conditioning, rather than nonconvexity or model expressivity, can constitute a dominant practical bottleneck. In contrast, one-shot LSR systematically exposes accuracy levels not fully exploited by gradient-based training, frequently achieving order-of-magnitude error reductions. For operator-constrained problems with composite loss structures, we further introduce Iterative LSR, which alternates one-shot LSR with supervised nonlinear alignment, transforming ill-conditioned residual minimization into numerically benign fitting steps and yielding accelerated convergence and improved accuracy. By bridging nonlinear neural representations with reduced-order linear solvers at fixed linearization points, LSR provides a numerically grounded and broadly applicable refinement framework for supervised learning, operator learning, and scientific computing."}

This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.\n  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.\n  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP."}

The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases.

However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b."}

Comparative experiments with neural networks demonstrate that TPBS models outperform neural networks in the overfitting regime for most datasets, and maintain competitive performance otherwise. Overall, TPBS models exhibit greater robustness to overfitting and consistently benefit from regularization, while neural networks are more sensitive to overfitting and less effective in leveraging regularization."}

We argue that incorrect predictions arise when small errors in the attention mechanism accumulate to cross a threshold, and use this insight to derive a quantitative two-parameter relationship between the accuracy and the complexity of the task. The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases. Our model provides an alternative to suggestions that errors made by LLMs on long repetitive tasks indicate the ``collapse of reasoning'', or an inability to express ``compositional'' functions.

However, these benefits may be negated when customers drive to pick up their orders. This study proposes a Differentiated Pickup Point Offering (DPO) policy that aims to jointly reduce emissions from delivery truck routes and customer travel. Under DPO, each arriving customer is offered a single recommended pickup point, rather than an unrestricted choice among all locations, while retaining the option of home delivery. We study this problem in a dynamic and stochastic setting, where the pickup point offered to each customer depends on previously realized customer locations and delivery choices. To design effective DPO policies, we adopt a reinforcement learning-based approach that accounts for spatial relationships between customers and pickup points and their implications for future route consolidation. Computational experiments show that differentiated pickup point offerings can substantially reduce total carbon emissions. The proposed policies reduce total emissions by up to 9% relative to home-only delivery and by 2% on average compared with alternative policies, including unrestricted pickup point choice and nearest pickup point assignment. Differentiated offerings are particularly effective in dense urban settings with many pickup points and short inter-location distances. Moreover, explicitly accounting for the dynamic nature of customer arrivals and choices is especially important when customers are less inclined to choose pickup point delivery over home delivery."}

However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b."}

However, existing RL training pipelines are computationally inefficient and resource-intensive, with the rollout phase accounting for over 70% of total training time. Quantized RL training, particularly using FP8 precision, offers a promising approach to mitigating this bottleneck. A commonly adopted strategy applies FP8 precision during rollout while retaining BF16 precision for training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and demonstrate that the widely used BF16-training + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-horizon rollouts and challenging tasks. Our analysis shows that these failures stem from the off-policy nature of the approach, which introduces substantial numerical mismatch between training and inference. Motivated by these observations, we propose Jet-RL, an FP8 RL training framework that enables robust and stable RL optimization. The key idea is to adopt a unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, thereby minimizing numerical discrepancies and eliminating the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation."}

To address these limitations, we explore MIMIC-RD, a rare disease differential diagnosis benchmark constructed by directly mapping clinical text entities to Orphanet. Our methodology involved an initial LLM-based mining process followed by validation from four medical annotators to confirm identified entities were genuine rare diseases.

Most interpretability approaches emphasise static representations or causal interventions, leaving temporal structure largely unexplored. Drawing on neuroscience, where temporal integration and metastability are core markers of neural organisation, we adapt these concepts to transformer models and discuss a composite dynamical metric, computed from activation time-series during autoregressive generation. We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons. These results are robust to layer selection, channel subsampling, and random seeds. Our findings demonstrate that neuroscience-inspired dynamical metrics can reliably characterise differences in computational organisation across functional regimes in large language models. We stress that the proposed metric captures formal dynamical properties and does not imply subjective experience."}

RSP is computed from within-run drift dynamics and requires no tuning on out-of-distribution data. Across multiple lightweight transformer classifiers and benchmark classification tasks, drift typically collapses into a low, stable regime early in training, while validation accuracy continues to change only marginally. In a controlled shortcut setting with label-correlated trigger tokens, attribution dynamics expose increasing reliance on the shortcut even when validation accuracy remains competitive.

We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks. Our results highlight the promise of recourse-aware, LLM-assisted bandit algorithms for trustworthy LLM-bandits collaboration in personalized high-stakes decision-making."}

However, its potential for enhancing tasks that demand step-by-step logical deduction, such as mathematical reasoning, remains underexplored. A core limitation of existing ICL approaches is their static use of demonstrations: examples are pre-selected before inference and remain fixed, failing to adapt to the dynamic confusion points that often arise during multi-step reasoning such as ambiguous calculations or logical gaps. These unresolved confusion points can lead to cascading errors that degrade final accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose Process In-Context Learning (PICL), a dynamic demonstration integration framework designed to boost mathematical reasoning by responding to real-time inference needs. PICL operates in two stages: 1)~it identifies potential confusion points by analyzing semantics and entropy in the reasoning process and summarizes their core characteristics; 2)~upon encountering these points, it retrieves relevant demonstrations from the demonstration pool that match the confusion context and inserts them directly into the ongoing reasoning process to guide subsequent steps. Experiments show that PICL outperforms baseline methods by mitigating mid-inference confusion, highlighting the value of adaptive demonstration insertion in complex mathematical reasoning."}

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller."}

The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations. Several works have proposed to mitigate this, including the optimization of power allocation known as joint resource allocation(JRA) method, and integration of the JRA method and deep reinforcement learning (JRA-DRL). Despite this, the channel assignment problem remains unclear and requires further investigation.

However, most frameworks are homogeneous, where all agents share the same base LLM and differ only in prompts, tools, and positions in the workflow. This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow.

These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research.

Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the \"Weakest Link Law\": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $<3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks.

In multidefendant cases, assigning responsibility is complex and challenges fairness, requiring precise role differentiation. However, judicial phrasing often obscures the roles of the defendants, hindering effective AI-driven analyses. To address this issue, we incorporate sentencing logic into a pretrained Transformer encoder framework to enhance the intelligent assistance in multidefendant cases while ensuring legal interpretability. Within this framework an oriented masking mechanism clarifies roles and a comparative data construction strategy improves the model's sensitivity to culpability distinctions between principals and accomplices. Predicted guilt labels are further incorporated into a regression model through broadcasting, consolidating crime descriptions and court views. Our proposed masked multistage inference (MMSI) framework, evaluated on the custom IMLJP dataset for intentional injury cases, achieves significant accuracy improvements, outperforming baselines in role-based culpability differentiation. This work offers a robust solution for enhancing intelligent judicial systems, with publicly code available."}

While numerical fine-tuning excels at injecting new factual knowledge, symbolic updates offer flexible control of style and alignment without retraining. We introduce a neurosymbolic LoRA framework that dynamically combines these two complementary strategies. Specifically, we present a unified monitoring signal and a reward-based classifier to decide when to employ LoRA for deeper factual reconstruction and when to apply TextGrad for token-level edits. Our approach remains memory-efficient by offloading the symbolic transformations to an external LLM only when needed. Additionally, the refined prompts produced during symbolic editing serve as high-quality, reusable training data, an important benefit in data-scarce domains like mathematical reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones show that neurosymbolic LoRA consistently outperforms purely numerical or purely symbolic baselines, demonstrating superior adaptability and improved performance. Our findings highlight the value of interleaving numerical and symbolic updates to unlock a new level of versatility in language model fine-tuning."}

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness. Overall, SL-CBM bridges the gap between concept-based reasoning and spatial explainability, setting a new standard for interpretable and trustworthy concept-based models."}

This occurs because current pipelines sample candidate steps from generic prompts or learned policies with weak domain priors, yielding near-random walks over operators, units, and formats. To promote ordered exploration, this paper introduces SCULPT, a constraint-guided approach for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that integrates domain-aware scoring into selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. SCULPT scores and prunes actions using a combination of symbolic checks (dimensional consistency, type compatibility, magnitude sanity, depth control, and diversity) and structural pattern guidance, thereby steering the search toward plausible reasoning paths. Under matched LLM configurations, SCULPT yields stable improvements on multiple datasets; additional results with GPT-5.2 assess executor transferability and performance on frontier reasoning models. Overall, domain-aware constraints can improve accuracy while maintaining efficiency and reasoning stability."}

It's accepted by WWW 2026 Web4Good Track. To make accessible earlier, authors would like to put it on arxiv before the conference", "summary": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, continues to pose a persistent public health challenge in urban areas, particularly in tropical regions such as Singapore. Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource. The proposed framework advances epidemic modeling while providing a scalable, low-cost tool for public health planning, early intervention, and urban resilience."}

Recently, a multitude of communication methods have been introduced to this field to address problems such as partially observable environments, non-stationarity, and exponentially growing action spaces. Communication further enables efficient cooperation among all agents interacting in an environment. This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning. By an in-depth analysis of 29 publications on this topic, the strengths and weaknesses of explicit, implicit, attention-based, graph-based, and hierarchical/role-based communication are evaluated. The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand. The comparison also highlights the importance of communication methods with low computational overhead to enable scalability to environments where many agents interact. Finally, the paper discusses current research gaps, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarking of system-level metrics and improved robustness under realistic communication conditions to enhance the real-world applicability of these approaches."}

We hypothesise that four symmetries suffice to (i) motivate core interpretability properties, (ii) characterize the class of interpretable models, and (iii) derive a unified formulation of interpretable inference (e.g., alignment, interventions, and counterfactuals) as a form of Bayesian inversion."}

As MAS become increasingly deployed in web services (e.g., search engines), designing adaptive topologies for diverse cross-domain user queries becomes essential. Current graph learning-based design methodologies often adhere to a \"one-for-one\" paradigm, where a specialized model is trained for each specific task domain. This approach suffers from poor generalization to unseen domains and fails to leverage shared structural knowledge across different tasks. To address this, we propose OFA-TAD, a one-for-all framework that generates adaptive collaboration graphs for any task described in natural language through a single universal model. Our approach integrates a Task-Aware Graph State Encoder (TAGSE) that filters task-relevant node information via sparse gating, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically selects specialized sub-networks to drive node and edge prediction. We employ a three-stage training strategy: unconditional pre-training on canonical topologies for structural priors, large-scale conditional pre-training on LLM-generated datasets for task-topology mappings, and supervised fine-tuning on empirically validated graphs. Experiments across six diverse benchmarks show that OFA-TAD significantly outperforms specialized one-for-one models, generating highly adaptive MAS topologies.

Analyzing 25,000+ chain-of-thought trajectories across four domains (Law, Science, Code, Math) and two scales (8B, 70B parameters), we discover that neural scaling laws trigger domain-specific phase transitions rather than uniform capability gains. Legal reasoning undergoes Crystallization: 45% collapse in representational dimensionality (d95: 501 -> 274), 31% increase in trajectory alignment, and 10x manifold untangling. Scientific and mathematical reasoning remain Liquid - geometrically invariant despite 9x parameter increase. Code reasoning forms a discrete Lattice of strategic modes (silhouette: 0.13 -> 0.42). This geometry predicts learnability. We introduce Neural Reasoning Operators - learned mappings from initial to terminal hidden states. In crystalline legal reasoning, our operator achieves 63.6% accuracy on held-out tasks via probe decoding, predicting reasoning endpoints without traversing intermediate states. We further identify a universal oscillatory signature (coherence ~ -0.4) invariant across domains and scales, suggesting attention and feedforward layers drive reasoning through opposing dynamics. These findings establish that the cost of thought is determined not by task difficulty but by manifold geometry - offering a blueprint for inference acceleration where topology permits."}

Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics."}

Modern AI systems, including LLMs and ViTs, largely operate as sequence-of-behavior prediction machines: they match observable behaviors by modeling token statistics without a persistent, readable mental state. This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly. Qualitatively, our models exhibit more coherent rule-application structure than the dense ViT baseline, consistent with a shift away from plausible probability blobs toward controller-driven reasoning."}

To distinguish genuine predictive capability from memorization-based performance, we analyze performance decay across temporally distinct market regimes, incorporating several quantitative baselines to establish performance thresholds. We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size. This work establishes a foundation for the standardized evaluation of temporal bias in financial LLMs and provides a practical framework for identifying models suitable for real-world deployment.

Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate."}
