The results show that\nallostatic and social allostatic regulation enable agents to leverage\nenvironmental and social ``noise'' for adaptive reconfiguration, leading to\nimproved viability compared to purely reactive homeostatic agents. This work\noffers a novel computational perspective on the principles of social allostasis\nand their potential for designing more robust, bio-inspired, adaptive systems"}

These global hierarchical classifiers are applied\nto learned deep features extracted by representation learning, allowing the\nentire model to be end-to-end learnable. In addition, we develop a re-weighted\nhierarchical knowledge correlation matrix (Re-HKCM) scheme by embedding\ninter-class hierarchical knowledge into a data-driven statistical correlation\nmatrix (SCM) which effectively guides the information sharing of nodes in\ngraphical convolutional neural networks and avoids over-smoothing issues. The\nRe-HKCM is derived from the SCM through a series of mathematical\ntransformations. Extensive experiments are performed on four real-world\ndatasets from different industrial domains (three cavitation datasets from\nSAMSON AG and one existing publicly) for FID, all showing superior results and\noutperform recent state-of-the-art FID methods."}

Parametric projections make it\npossible to embed new, unseen samples without recalculating the entire\nprojection, while invertible projections allow the synthesis of new data\ninstances. However, existing methods perform poorly when dealing with\nout-of-distribution samples in either the data or embedding space. Thus, we\npropose DE-VAE, an uncertainty-aware variational AE using differential entropy\n(DE) to improve the learned parametric and invertible projections. Given a\nfixed projection, we train DE-VAE to learn a mapping into 2D space and an\ninverse mapping back to the original space. We conduct quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations on four well-known datasets, using UMAP and t-SNE as\nbaseline projection methods. Our findings show that DE-VAE can create\nparametric and inverse projections with comparable accuracy to other current\nAE-based approaches while enabling the analysis of embedding uncertainty."}

Building on this foundation, we introduce an Integrated\nPlanning Recommendation System that combines CDMCLP with socio-economic factors\nand dynamic clustering initialization. This system leverages adaptive parameter\ntuning based on empirical user behavior to generate practical planning\nsolutions.

We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires\nmore than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only\nmust AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also\nbe able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values\noutside of those embedded in the alignment phase.

Drawing on this theoretical\nframework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular\nopen LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models\nand highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral\nreasoning.

We\nconvert a univariate series into a leakage-free supervised learning problem,\ntrain a gradient-boosted tree alongside an ARIMA baseline and apply post-hoc\nexplainability. Using the Air Passengers dataset as a case study, we show that\na small set of lagged features -- particularly the twelve-month lag -- and\nseasonal encodings explain most forecast variance. We contribute: (i) a\nmethodology for applying LIME and SHAP to time series without violating\nchronology; (ii) theoretical exposition of the underlying algorithms; (iii)\nempirical evaluation with extensive analysis; and (iv) guidelines for\npractitioners."}

To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring\nContrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by\njointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from\nprevious works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor\nthe context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the\nattributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore,\nCRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the\nmessage-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex\ninteraction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while\nencouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover\nintricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated\nwith the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness\nunlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative\nnode embeddings.

At inference\ntime, routing reduces to a single k-NN lookup via a FAISS index, requiring no\nretraining when the expert pool changes and enabling microsecond latency.\nAcross multiple benchmarks, CSCR consistently outperforms baselines, improving\nthe accuracy-cost tradeoff by up to 25%, while generalizing robustly to unseen\nLLMs and out-of-distribution prompts."}

This is accomplished by modeling the\nunderlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run\nexpensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output,\nsurrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input\nparameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find\nparameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding\nthese parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter\nspaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a\nsmall set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader\npicture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the\ndistribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature.\nTo achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation\nerror inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter\ndistribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation,\nreporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to\ntraining parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density\nestimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a\nlikelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter\nconfigurations that generate a target output feature.

However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between\ntraining and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the\nstructure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens,\nwhereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random.\nAlthough this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal\nperformance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing\nthis gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the\nproblem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential\ndecision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement\nlearning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to\nexploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model\nunder the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches\nthe performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer\ngradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and\n54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight\nupdates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in\ninference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine\ntokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we\nrefer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains\nwhen combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for\ninvestigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs.\nCode: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and\nlearning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how\nagents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to\nmaximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative\nmodel of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have\nbeen proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they\nall share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an\nappropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their\ndesirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past\nmotor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents\nare assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan\nfor the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and\nmust infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for\nthe future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two\nleading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an\nefference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions.

In the YLE, agents take turns peeking at hidden\ncards and moving them to form clusters based on colour. Success requires\ntracking evolving beliefs, remembering past observations, using hints as\ngrounded communication, and maintaining common ground with teammates.

With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal\ndata analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these\nphenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims\nto identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation\nevents. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an\n\"intervention\" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and\nseparation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models\nare built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us\nto infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal\ngraphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step\nto infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal\nmodels. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional\ndistributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,\nthis framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular\ndynamic systems.
