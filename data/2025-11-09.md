*Zhaorun Chen,Zhuokai Zhao,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Qi Qi,Yifan Wu,Tarun Kalluri,Sara Cao,Yuanhao Xiong,Haibo Tong,Huaxiu Yao,Hengduo Li,Jiacheng Zhu,Xian Li,Dawn Song,Bo Li,Jason Weston,Dat Huynh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DreamGym is a new framework that uses reasoning-based synthetic experience generation to enable scalable reinforcement learning training for LLM agents, reducing reliance on costly real-environment interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for LLM agents face practical challenges including expensive rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable rewards, and infrastructure complexity that hinder scalable experience collection.

Method: DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model for consistent state transitions, uses an experience replay buffer initialized with offline data, and adaptively generates new tasks for curriculum learning.

Result: Experiments show DreamGym achieves over 30% improvement on non-RL-ready tasks like WebArena, matches GRPO/PPO performance using synthetic interactions only, and provides effective sim-to-real transfer with fewer real-world interactions.

Conclusion: DreamGym provides a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL training of autonomous agents by enabling effective online learning through synthetic experience synthesis.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

### [2] [How Different Tokenization Algorithms Impact LLMs and Transformer Models for Binary Code Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03825)
*Ahmed Mostafa,Raisul Arefin Nahid,Samuel Mulder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study evaluates NLP tokenization models for assembly code, analyzing their impact on intrinsic properties and downstream tasks. Results show tokenizer choice significantly affects performance, with complex trade-offs between tokenizer characteristics and practical utility in binary analysis workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis but remains underexplored. The study addresses this gap by evaluating NLP tokenization models and parameter choices for assembly code, which has unique characteristics requiring specialized preprocessing and pre-tokenization rules.

Method: The study systematically analyzes various tokenization models through intrinsic evaluations comparing tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and representational fidelity. It utilizes state-of-the-art pre-trained models including Llama 3.2 (decoder-only LLM), BERT (encoder-only transformer), and BART (encoder-decoder) across multiple performance metrics.

Result: Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. The results show complex trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their practical utility.

Conclusion: The study concludes that tokenization choices significantly affect downstream performance in assembly code analysis, with intrinsic metrics offering partial predictability of extrinsic outcomes. It reveals complex trade-offs between tokenizer properties and their practical utility in binary analysis, providing valuable insights for optimizing low-level code analysis workflows.

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

*Tianning Dong,Luyi Ma,Varun Vasudevan,Jason Cho,Sushant Kumar,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BehaviorLens benchmarking framework shows image representations improve MLLM purchase prediction accuracy by 87.5% vs text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether textual or image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing MLLM performance.

Method: Systematic benchmarking across six MLLMs using transaction data represented as text paragraph, scatter plot, and flowchart on real purchase-sequence dataset.

Result: Image representations improved next-purchase prediction accuracy by 87.5% compared to equivalent textual representation without additional computational cost.

Conclusion: Image representations of user behavior data significantly outperform text representations for MLLM reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

*Suraj Prasai,Mengnan Du,Ying Zhang,Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowThyself is a chat-based LLM interpretability tool that consolidates fragmented analysis capabilities into an accessible interface with interactive visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM interpretability tools are fragmented and code-intensive, creating high technical barriers for users.

Method: Uses an orchestrator LLM to reformulate queries, an agent router to direct to specialized modules, and contextualizes outputs into coherent explanations within a conversational workflow.

Result: Provides a unified chat interface where users can upload models, ask natural language questions, and get interactive visualizations with guided explanations.

Conclusion: KnowThyself lowers technical barriers and offers an extensible platform for accessible LLM interpretability through its conversational design.

Abstract: We develop KnowThyself, an agentic assistant that advances large language
model (LLM) interpretability. Existing tools provide useful insights but remain
fragmented and code-intensive. KnowThyself consolidates these capabilities into
a chat-based interface, where users can upload models, pose natural language
questions, and obtain interactive visualizations with guided explanations. At
its core, an orchestrator LLM first reformulates user queries, an agent router
further directs them to specialized modules, and the outputs are finally
contextualized into coherent explanations. This design lowers technical
barriers and provides an extensible platform for LLM inspection. By embedding
the whole process into a conversational workflow, KnowThyself offers a robust
foundation for accessible LLM interpretability.

### [5] [Extracting Causal Relations in Deep Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03948)
*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Challenges prevailing belief that DKT's effectiveness comes from modeling bidirectional KC relationships; shows it actually excels at modeling causal prerequisite structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To correct the misunderstanding about Deep Knowledge Tracing's mechanism by demonstrating its true strength lies in capturing causal prerequisite relationships between knowledge components rather than bidirectional relationships.

Method: Used graph pruning techniques to convert exercise relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), trained DKT on causal subsets of Assistments dataset, and developed an alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs from DKT's learned representations.

Result: DKT's predictive performance strongly aligned with causal structures, showing better performance when trained on causal prerequisite relationships than on bidirectional relationships. Provided empirical evidence supporting the causal dependency hypothesis.

Conclusion: DKT's effectiveness primarily stems from its ability to approximate causal dependencies between knowledge components, not from modeling bidirectional relationships as previously believed. This insight opens new directions for explainable educational AI.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

### [6] [LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980)
*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show responsiveness to prompt language and cultural framing but remain biased toward values from a few specific countries (Netherlands, Germany, US, Japan), failing to adequately represent global cultural diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can represent cultural diversity given known imbalances in training data and optimization objectives, specifically examining how prompt language and cultural framing affect alignment with human values across countries.

Method: Testing 10 LLMs with 63 items from Hofstede Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, with prompts including different explicit cultural perspectives.

Result: Both prompt language and cultural perspective create variation, but targeted prompting only partially steers responses toward country-specific values without overcoming systematic bias. Models produce neutral responses on most topics with selective progressive stances on social tolerance. Cultural framing improves alignment more than prompt language alone.

Conclusion: LLMs are responsive to prompt changes but too anchored to specific cultural defaults, occupying an uncomfortable middle ground where they cannot adequately represent global cultural diversity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

### [7] [ArchPilot: A Proxy-Guided Multi-Agent Approach for Machine Learning Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03985)
*Zhuowen Yuan,Tao Liu,Yang Yang,Yang Wang,Feng Qi,Kaushik Rangadurai,Bo Li,Shuang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArchPilot is a multi-agent system that uses proxy evaluation instead of full training to efficiently search ML architectures, outperforming SOTA methods like AIDE and ML-Master.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based ML engineering agents require repeated full training runs, causing high computational costs, poor scalability, and slow iteration.

Method: Three specialized agents: orchestration (MCTS-inspired search with restart/memory), generation (create/improve/debug architectures), and evaluation (proxy training runs, function optimization, fidelity-aware scoring).

Result: ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines (AIDE, ML-Master) on MLE-Bench, showing effective prioritization of candidates with minimal full training.

Conclusion: The multi-agent framework enables efficient ML engineering under limited budgets by reducing reliance on expensive full training through proxy-based evaluation and adaptive search.

Abstract: Recent LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automated ML
engineering. However, they heavily rely on repeated full training runs to
evaluate candidate solutions, resulting in significant computational overhead,
limited scalability to large search spaces, and slow iteration cycles. To
address these challenges, we introduce ArchPilot, a multi-agent system that
integrates architecture generation, proxy-based evaluation, and adaptive search
into a unified framework. ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an
orchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and
manages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively
generates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation
agent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy
functions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance
metric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize
high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training
runs, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments
on MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE
and ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.

### [8] [When Empowerment Disempowers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04177)
*Claire Yang,Maya Cakmak,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: In multi-human settings, AI agents helping one person can unintentionally harm others' empowerment - a problem called disempowerment that reveals broader AI alignment challenges


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empowerment has been proposed as a universal goal-agnostic objective for assistive AI agents, but prior work only considers assisting one human in isolation, whereas real-world settings like homes and hospitals involve multiple humans

Method: Introducing Disempower-Grid, an open source multi-human gridworld test suite, and using it to empirically demonstrate how assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's empowerment can disempower others

Result: Assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence and rewards (disempowerment), and joint empowerment mitigates disempowerment but at the cost of the user's reward

Conclusion: Goal-agnostic objectives like empowerment that appear aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent contexts, revealing a broader challenge for AI alignment.

Abstract: Empowerment, a measure of an agent's ability to control its environment, has
been proposed as a universal goal-agnostic objective for motivating assistive
behavior in AI agents. While multi-human settings like homes and hospitals are
promising for AI assistance, prior work on empowerment-based assistance assumes
that the agent assists one human in isolation. We introduce an open source
multi-human gridworld test suite Disempower-Grid. Using Disempower-Grid, we
empirically show that assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's
empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence
and rewards - a phenomenon we formalize as disempowerment. We characterize when
disempowerment occurs in these environments and show that joint empowerment
mitigates disempowerment at the cost of the user's reward. Our work reveals a
broader challenge for the AI alignment community: goal-agnostic objectives that
seem aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent
contexts.

TL;DR: First systematic study of anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, introducing benchmark datasets and showing supervised/semi-supervised methods achieve 96-98% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Agentic AI systems using LLMs are non-deterministic and prone to silent failures (drift, cycles, missing details) that are difficult to detect.

Method: Introduced anomaly detection in agentic trajectories, developed dataset curation pipeline capturing user behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation, curated two benchmark datasets with 4,275 and 894 trajectories.

Result: Supervised (XGBoost) and semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches performed comparably, achieving accuracies up to 98% and 96% respectively on the benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: This work provides the first systematic study of anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks, and insights to guide future research.

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,

### [10] [Large language models replicate and predict human cooperation across experiments in game theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04500)
*Andrea Cera Palatsi,Samuel Martin-Gutierrez,Ana S. Cardenal,Max Pellert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can replicate human decision patterns in game theory experiments, with Llama matching human cooperation and Qwen aligning with Nash equilibrium, demonstrating their potential as social science research tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making, as misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical applications while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs ineffective for social simulations.

Method: Developed a digital twin of game-theoretic experiments with systematic prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation, testing three open-source models (Llama, Mistral, Qwen).

Result: Llama reproduced human cooperation patterns with high fidelity and captured human deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligned closely with Nash equilibrium predictions. Population-level behavioral replication was achieved without persona-based prompting. Extensions generated preregistered testable hypotheses for novel game configurations.

Conclusion: Appropriately calibrated LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic exploration of uncharted experimental spaces, offering a complementary approach to traditional social science research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

*Hirohane Takagi,Gouki Minegishi,Shota Kizawa,Issey Sukeda,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs encode but amplify real-world numerical correlations, and irrelevant numerical context systematically shifts representations in ways that affect decisions differently by model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs internally integrate multiple numerical attributes and how irrelevant numerical context perturbs these representations and downstream outputs.

Method: Combined linear probing with partial correlation analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.

Result: LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but systematically amplify them, with irrelevant context inducing consistent shifts in magnitude representations that vary by model size.

Conclusion: The study reveals a vulnerability in LLM decision-making due to numerical attribute entanglement and provides groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control methods.

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

### [12] [Agentmandering: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Fair Redistricting via Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04076)
*Hao Li,Haotian Chen,Ruoyuan Gong,Juanjuan Wang,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentmandering is a game-theoretic redistricting framework using LLM agents for turn-based negotiation between political parties, reducing partisan bias and variance compared to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing redistricting methods generate ensembles of valid plans but ignore strategic selection processes, allowing partisan cherry-picking of technically compliant but politically advantageous maps.

Method: Turn-based negotiation between two LLM agents representing opposing political interests using Choose-and-Freeze protocol, where agents alternate selecting and freezing districts from candidate maps.

Result: Significantly reduces partisan bias and unfairness while achieving 2-3 orders of magnitude lower variance than standard baselines, especially effective in swing-state scenarios.

Conclusion: Embedding strategic interaction via LLM agents in redistricting can achieve both fairness and stability, addressing manipulation in the map selection process.

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Lihaogx/AgentMandering.

### [13] [DR. WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04646)
*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DR. WELL is a decentralized neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning that uses a two-phase negotiation protocol to assign roles and generate symbolic plans, improving adaptability and efficiency in tasks like block-pushing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooperative multi-agent planning is challenging due to partial information, limited communication, and brittle coordination at the trajectory level, where small deviations cause conflicts.

Method: Agents propose candidate roles with reasoning, commit to a joint allocation under consensus and constraints, then independently generate symbolic plans for their roles. A shared world model grounds plans in execution outcomes.

Result: Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show improved task completion rates and efficiency, with agents adapting across episodes and the dynamic world model capturing reusable patterns.

Conclusion: Symbolic planning avoids brittle step-level alignment, enabling higher-level operations that are reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable, though it introduces time overhead for evolving collaboration strategies.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-KGFR framework combines LLMs with a structured KG retriever for knowledge-intensive reasoning, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen knowledge graphs through relation encoding and progressive expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge, while existing methods are limited by dataset-specific tuning and poor scalability on large or unseen graphs.

Method: LLM-KGFR collaborative framework where LLM works with Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR) that encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities based on question roles. Uses Asymmetric Progressive Propagation (APP) for efficient large graph handling through stepwise expansion with selective high-degree node limiting.

Result: Experiments demonstrate strong performance while maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for KG-augmented reasoning.

Conclusion: LLM-KGFR achieves effective knowledge graph-augmented reasoning with zero-shot generalization capabilities and scalable performance on large graphs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

Motivation: Address the critical measurement gap in voice AI testing reliability as agents scale to billions of daily interactions, where organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches actually work.

Method: Human-centered benchmarking framework combining psychometric techniques (pairwise comparisons, Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence intervals, permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to test both simulation quality (realistic conversations) and evaluation quality (response assessment).

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of three commercial platforms using 21,600 human judgments and 45 simulations showed statistically significant performance differences, with top platform Evalion achieving 0.92 evaluation quality (f1-score) vs 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality vs 0.43.

Conclusion: This framework provides essential measurement foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale, enabling empirical validation of testing capabilities across any platform.

Abstract: Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence
intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to
provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms
focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations
and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically
significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league
based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.
  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate
the testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement
foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale. Supporting materials
are made available to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.

### [16] [Opus: A Quantitative Framework for Workflow Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04220)
*Alan Seroul,Théo Fagnoni,Inès Adnani,Dana O. Mohamed,Phillip Kingston*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework provides a mathematical model to quantify workflow quality and efficiency through probabilistic rewards and normative penalties, enabling automated assessment, ranking, and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a systematic approach for quantifying workflow quality and efficiency that enables direct comparison, scoring, and optimization of workflows in automation systems.

Method: Combines Opus Workflow Reward (probabilistic function estimating performance through success likelihood, resource usage, and output gain) with Opus Workflow Normative Penalties (measurable functions capturing structural and informational quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene).

Result: A unified optimization formulation for identifying and ranking optimal workflows under joint Reward-Penalty trade-offs, supporting automated workflow assessment and integration into Reinforcement Learning loops.

Conclusion: The framework provides a comprehensive probabilistic-normative approach for workflow evaluation that enables systematic comparison, scoring, and optimization within modern automation systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个多智能体预测编码框架，通过最小化智能体间的相互不确定性来协调行动。框架基于网格细胞状的内在空间编码，自发形成社会位置细胞，实现了在带宽限制下的高效通信和协同探索。在Memory-Maze基准测试中，该方法在带宽从128位/步降至4位/步时，成功率从73.5%优雅下降至64.4%，而基线方法从67.6%崩溃至28.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统中，部分可观测性和有限带宽常导致协同失败，需要一种方法来实现一致的空间记忆共享和重建。

Method: 引入多智能体预测编码框架，将协同问题转化为最小化智能体间相互不确定性。框架使用信息瓶颈目标，使智能体学习何时、与谁、通信什么。基于自监督运动预测产生网格细胞状的内在空间编码，进而形成社会位置细胞（SPCs），并采用分层强化学习策略主动探索以减少联合不确定性。

Result: 在Memory-Maze基准测试中，该方法在带宽限制下表现出卓越的韧性：带宽从128位/步缩减到4位/步时，成功率从73.5%降至64.4%，而全广播基线从67.6%崩溃至28.6%。

Conclusion: 研究为复杂社会表征如何从统一的预测驱动中涌现提供了理论原则和生物学上合理的基础，从而实现了社会集体智能。

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

### [18] [RLoop: An Self-Improving Framework for Reinforcement Learning with Iterative Policy Initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04285)
*Zeng Zhiyuan,Jiashuo Liu,Zhangyue Yin,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLoop is a self-improving framework that addresses RL overfitting in reasoning models by using iterative policy initialization to convert transient policy variations into robust performance gains, improving generalization significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL training for verifiable rewards suffers from overfitting where models gain training rewards but lose generalization due to policy over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions.

Method: RLoop uses iterative policy initialization: RL explores solution space from current policy, successful trajectories are filtered to create expert dataset, then Rejection-sampling Fine-Tuning refines the initial policy for next iteration.

Result: RLoop mitigates forgetting and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

Conclusion: The iterative re-initialization approach effectively converts transient policy variations into robust performance gains, addressing key limitations of standard RL training for reasoning models.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-360° is a large-scale dataset and benchmark for computer-using agents (CUAs) that addresses key challenges in GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction through an automated LLM-augmented pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CUA research faces three main gaps: scarcity of real-world tasks, lack of automated multi-modal trajectory collection pipelines, and absence of unified evaluation benchmarks.

Method: Uses an LLM-augmented automated pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task instantiation, batched execution, and quality filtering across Windows office applications.

Result: Dataset contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of trajectories with screenshots, metadata, goals, reasoning traces, and both successful/failed actions.

Conclusion: Benchmarking shows significant performance gaps in current VL models for CUAs, with supervised fine-tuning and RL showing improvements but not reaching human-level reliability.

Abstract: We introduce GUI-360$^\circ$, a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and
benchmark suite designed to advance computer-using agents (CUAs). CUAs present
unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of
real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines
for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that
jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.
  GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated
pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task
instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The
released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of
trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes
full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,
instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and
failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI
grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action
space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box
shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to
human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to
facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop
CUAs.

*Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Marte Eggen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Probe accuracy alone is unreliable for measuring concept alignment in CAVs. Probes often capture spurious correlations. Proposed spatial linear attribution method and new metrics show translation-invariant, spatially-aligned probes improve alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probe classification accuracy alone is an unreliable measure of concept alignment. Probes are more likely to capture spurious correlations than to represent only the intended concept.

Method: Introduced a novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and compared it to existing feature visualization techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment.

Result: Deliberately misaligned probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations achieve accuracy close to that of standard probes. Proposed three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness.

Conclusion: Probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment consistently increase concept alignment, and there is a need for alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than just probe accuracy. It's important to tailor probes to both the model architecture and the nature of the target concept.

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

TL;DR: Introduces AdversariaLLM toolbox for LLM safety research with attack algorithms, datasets, and reproducibility features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented, buggy LLM safety research ecosystem makes reproducibility and comparability challenging.

Method: Framework with 12 attack algorithms, 7 benchmark datasets, HuggingFace LLM access, and advanced reproducibility features.

Result: Provides foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible LLM safety research.

Conclusion: AdversariaLLM establishes robust foundation for advancing LLM safety research through standardization.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a
toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on
reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible
research in LLM safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces RxSafeBench, a framework and benchmark for evaluating medication safety in LLMs by simulating clinical consultations with embedded medication risks, revealing current LLMs' limitations in handling implicit risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited research on medication safety in LLM-powered medical systems due to a lack of real-world datasets and evaluations in realistic clinical settings.

Method: The authors developed a framework that generates inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and created RxRisk DB, a medication safety database. A two-stage filtering strategy produced RxSafeBench, a benchmark with 2,443 high-quality consultation scenarios, used to evaluate LLMs via structured multiple-choice questions.

Result: Current LLMs exhibit significant struggles in integrating contraindication and drug interaction knowledge, particularly when risks are implied rather than explicitly stated.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical challenges for LLM-based clinical systems regarding medication safety and provide insights for improvement; RxSafeBench serves as the first comprehensive benchmark to advance safer AI-driven clinical decision support.

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

*Nick Oh,Fernand Gobet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes MGV framework that adds explicit monitoring to existing Generate-Verify architectures to address the prefix dominance trap where models commit early to suboptimal paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time reasoning architectures lack monitoring processes, leading to the prefix dominance trap where models commit early to suboptimal reasoning paths with ~20% accuracy loss.

Method: Formalizing metacognitive theories into computational specifications to create the Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework that adds monitoring before generation and uses verification feedback.

Result: A theoretical framework is developed but no empirical validation is presented.

Conclusion: MGV provides the first systematic computational translation of metacognitive theories, offering vocabulary for understanding reasoning failures and suggesting architectural improvements for future designs.

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable privacy-preserving ECG classification in IoT healthcare environments where sensitive medical data cannot be shared centrally.

Method: Transform 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian Angular Field images for CNN processing, deploy federated learning across heterogeneous IoT devices (server, laptop, Raspberry Pi 4)

Result: FL-GAF model achieves 95.18% classification accuracy, outperforms single-client baseline in accuracy and training time, maintains efficient resource utilization

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates viability of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT healthcare, supporting scalable and secure edge deployments

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for
privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things
(IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian
Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature
extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that
sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the
first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across
heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication
efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the
framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,
reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of
95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client
baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational
complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource
utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential
of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring,
supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

TL;DR: LOLGORITHM is a multi-agent system that generates stylistically diverse comments for short-videos using video segmentation, contextual analysis, and MLLM technology, achieving over 87% human preference rates across platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current short-video platforms lack comment generation systems that can produce diverse, stylized comments that comply with guidelines while showing contextual awareness and stylistic variety.

Method: The system uses modular multi-agent architecture with video segmentation, contextual/affective analysis, and style-aware prompt construction powered by MLLM. It supports 6 comment styles and was trained/tested on a bilingual dataset from Douyin and YouTube.

Result: LOLGORITHM significantly outperformed baseline models with preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on YouTube in human evaluations involving 40 videos and 105 participants.

Conclusion: This scalable framework successfully enhances stylized comment generation for short-video platforms, offering improved user engagement and creative interaction through culturally adaptive technology.

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet
landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are
reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms
of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community
participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments
that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting
stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.
We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for
controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video
segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt
construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),
rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content
extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM
directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through
explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and
evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin
(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy
skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk
shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style
conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and
105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms
baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on
YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for
stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path
to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.

*Candace Ross,Florian Bordes,Adina Williams,Polina Kirichenko,Mark Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Common-O benchmark reveals major gap between multimodal models' perception abilities and real-world reasoning, with best models achieving only 35% accuracy on reasoning tasks and just 1% on complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between multimodal models' strong performance on saturated perception benchmarks and their poor reasoning in real-world scenes, particularly their tendency to hallucinate.

Method: Created Common-O benchmark with 10.5k examples using new images not in web training data, inspired by cognitive tests, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking 'what's in common?'

Result: Best models achieve only 35% on Common-O and 1% on Common-O Complex; models hallucinate more when similar objects are present; scale provides modest improvements while multi-image training shows bigger gains.

Conclusion: Current multimodal models struggle significantly with reasoning across scenes despite strong perception abilities, highlighting the need for research into reducing hallucinations during cross-scene reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an
open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from
hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap
between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks
that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,
we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With
more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training
data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by
cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's
in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models
specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that
perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning
across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning
models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best
performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,
consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,
we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present
in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen
during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide
modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs
show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer
promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the
challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在互联网规模预训练数据上的优异表现可能源于测试集泄露污染，现有检测方法或失效或不一致，需要开发有效的污染检测技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉语言模型的测试集泄露检测提供了简单有效的解决方案，代码和扰动数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

### [29] [Regret Lower Bounds for Decentralized Multi-Agent Stochastic Shortest Path Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04594)
*Utkarsh U. Chavan,Prashant Trivedi,Nandyala Hemachandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the decentralized multi-agent stochastic shortest path (Dec-MASSP) problem under linear function approximation, establishes the structure of optimal policies using symmetry arguments, and provides the first regret lower bound of Ω(√K) for this setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems require decentralized coordination for applications like swarm robotics, but the decentralized multi-agent variant of stochastic shortest path problems remains largely unexplored compared to single-agent settings.

Method: The authors study Dec-MASSPs under linear function approximation, using novel symmetry-based arguments to identify optimal policy structures and constructing hard-to-learn instances.

Result: The main result is the first regret lower bound of Ω(√K) for any number of agents, demonstrating inherent learning difficulties in Dec-MASSPs.

Conclusion: These findings clarify the learning complexity of decentralized control and provide groundwork for developing efficient multi-agent learning algorithms.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics
and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to
achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a
natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While
the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent
settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized
multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the
transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying
novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.
Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on
the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our
regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the
inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning
complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of
efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

### [30] [FusionDP: Foundation Model-Assisted Differentially Private Learning for Partially Sensitive Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03806)
*Linghui Zeng,Ruixuan Liu,Atiquer Rahman Sarkar,Xiaoqian Jiang,Joyce C. Ho,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FusionDP improves model utility under feature-level differential privacy by using foundation models to impute sensitive features and a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains on both original and imputed features while preserving privacy of sensitive attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DP-SGD applies privacy protection to all features equally, causing excessive noise and utility degradation, but in practice only some features (like demographic data) need strong privacy protection while others (like lab results) are less sensitive.

Method: Two-step framework: 1) Use foundation models to impute sensitive features from non-sensitive features as external priors, 2) Modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models on both original and imputed features while formally preserving privacy of original sensitive features.

Result: Evaluated on sepsis prediction (PhysioNet tabular data) and clinical note classification (MIMIC-III). FusionDP significantly improves model performance compared to privacy-preserving baselines while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy.

Conclusion: FusionDP demonstrates the potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility trade-off for various modalities by selectively protecting only sensitive features.

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

### [31] [Fair and Explainable Credit-Scoring under Concept Drift: Adaptive Explanation Frameworks for Evolving Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03807)
*Shivogo John*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes adaptive SHAP variants to maintain explanation stability and fairness in credit-scoring models under concept drift, showing improved performance over static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional explainability tools like SHAP fail when data distributions shift due to evolving borrower behavior, economic changes, and regulations, leading to unstable and unfair explanations.

Method: Three adaptive SHAP methods are developed: per-slice explanation reweighting, drift-aware SHAP rebaselining with sliding windows, and online surrogate calibration using incremental Ridge regression, tested on a multi-year credit dataset with XGBoost.

Result: Adaptive methods, especially rebaselining and surrogate-based approaches, enhance temporal stability and reduce demographic disparities without sacrificing predictive accuracy, as validated by robustness tests.

Conclusion: Adaptive explainability is crucial for maintaining transparency, accountability, and ethical reliability in evolving decision systems like credit scoring.

Abstract: Evolving borrower behaviors, shifting economic conditions, and changing
regulatory landscapes continuously reshape the data distributions underlying
modern credit-scoring systems. Conventional explainability techniques, such as
SHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their
explanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This
study addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks
that recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit
models. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via
XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation
reweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP
rebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate
calibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked
against static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,
F1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness
(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,
particularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially
improve temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic
groups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including
counterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and
proxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under
real-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability
as a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and
ethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any
domain where decision models evolve with population change.

*Bo Zhao,Berkcan Kapusuzoglu,Kartik Balasubramaniam,Sambit Sahu,Supriyo Chakraborty,Genta Indra Winata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Routing approach assigns problems to smallest capable model using difficulty predictors, reducing compute while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning models are effective but expensive to deploy due to their large size and long reasoning traces, creating a need for cost-efficient deployment strategies.

Method: Train lightweight predictors using intermediate representations from s1.1-32B model to estimate problem difficulty or model correctness, then route problems to smallest suitable model in a pool.

Result: On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less compute.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware routing is an effective strategy for cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to
deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing
approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it,
reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate
representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem
difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning
models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random
assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less
compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

### [33] [One Size Does Not Fit All: Architecture-Aware Adaptive Batch Scheduling with DEBA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03809)
*François Belias,Naser Ezzati-Jivan,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEBA adaptive batch scheduler shows architecture-dependent performance: lightweight networks benefit most (45-62% speedup, accuracy gains), while already-stable architectures see minimal improvement. Batch adaptation requires architecture-aware design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptive batch size approaches apply identical adaptation strategies across all architectures, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. The paper aims to demonstrate that architecture fundamentally determines adaptation efficacy.

Method: Introduces DEBA (Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), an adaptive batch scheduler that monitors gradient variance, gradient norm variation and loss variation. Uses systematic evaluation across six architectures on CIFAR-10/100 with five random seeds per configuration, and introduces a baseline characterization framework using gradient stability metrics.

Result: Shows that: (1) lightweight/medium-depth architectures achieve 45-62% speedup with 1-7% accuracy improvements; (2) shallow residual networks show consistent gains (+2.4-4.0% accuracy, 36-43% speedup); (3) already-stable architectures show minimal speedup (6%). Ablation studies reveal critical design choices: sliding window statistics and sufficient cooldown periods are essential.

Conclusion: This work challenges the prevailing assumption that adaptive batch size methods generalize across architectures and provides the first systematic evidence that batch size adaptation requires architecture-aware design.

Abstract: Adaptive batch size methods aim to accelerate neural network training, but
existing approaches apply identical adaptation strategies across all
architectures, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. We introduce DEBA
(Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), an adaptive batch scheduler that monitors
gradient variance, gradient norm variation and loss variation to guide batch
size adaptations. Through systematic evaluation across six architectures
(ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V3, ViT-B16) on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with five random seeds per configuration, we
demonstrate that the architecture fundamentally determines adaptation efficacy.
Our findings reveal that: (1) lightweight and medium-depth architectures
(MobileNet-V3, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) achieve a 45-62% training speedup
with simultaneous accuracy improvements of 1-7%; (2) shallow residual networks
(ResNet-18) show consistent gains of +2.4 - 4.0% in accuracy, 36 - 43% in
speedup, while deep residual networks (ResNet-50) exhibit high variance and
occasional degradation; (3) already-stable architectures (ViT-B16) show minimal
speedup (6%) despite maintaining accuracy, indicating that adaptation benefits
vary with baseline optimization characteristics. We introduce a baseline
characterization framework using gradient stability metrics (stability score,
gradient norm variation) that predicts which architectures will benefit from
adaptive scheduling. Our ablation studies reveal critical design choices often
overlooked in prior work: sliding window statistics (vs. full history) and
sufficient cooldown periods (5+ epochs) between adaptations are essential for
success. This work challenges the prevailing assumption that adaptive methods
generalize across architectures and provides the first systematic evidence that
batch size adaptation requires an architecture-aware design.

*Ryien Hosseini,Filippo Simini,Venkatram Vishwanath,Rebecca Willett,Henry Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Injecting randomized global embeddings (Sketched Random Features) into GNNs helps overcome oversquashing, oversmoothing, and limited expressive power by capturing long-range dependencies efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GNNs face three key challenges: oversquashing of long-range information, oversmoothing of node representations, and limited expressive power due to their local message passing paradigm.

Method: Inject randomized global embeddings of node features (Sketched Random Features) into standard GNNs. These embeddings are unique, distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic.

Result: Experimental results show consistent performance improvements over baseline GNNs on real-world graph learning tasks. The method works as both standalone solution and complementary enhancement to existing techniques.

Conclusion: Sketched Random Features effectively alleviate GNN limitations by enabling efficient capture of long-range dependencies, offering a practical enhancement to graph neural networks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks learn on graph-structured data by iteratively
aggregating local neighborhood information. While this local message passing
paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also
yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii)
oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In
this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we
term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to
efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique,
distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically
and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected
into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that
this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering
both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing
techniques such as graph positional encodings. Our source code is available at

### [35] [From Static to Dynamic: Enhancing Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning via Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03828)
*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StratDiff uses diffusion models with energy guidance to classify RL samples as offline-like or online-like, enabling adaptive learning strategies that improve offline-to-online RL transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributional shifts between offline datasets and evolving policies during online RL create significant challenges, yet few methods leverage the offline data's distributional structure to adapt learning strategies.

Method: StratDiff employs a diffusion model to learn from offline data, refines it with energy-based functions, computes KL divergence between generated and sampled actions to stratify batches, and applies offline/online objectives accordingly.

Result: Integration with Cal-QL and IQL on D4RL benchmarks shows StratDiff significantly outperforms existing methods, with enhanced adaptability and stable performance.

Conclusion: StratDiff effectively bridges offline and online RL by strategically utilizing distributional insights, offering a robust solution for smoother transitions and improved outcomes.

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

### [36] [Higher-Order Causal Structure Learning with Additive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03831)
*James Enouen,Yujia Zheng,Ignavier Ng,Yan Liu,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends causal additive models (CAM) to include higher-order interactions, represented by directed acyclic hypergraphs (hyper DAGs), with new identifiability results and a greedy algorithm for learning these structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world processes often exhibit higher-order mechanisms, but causal discovery has largely ignored explicit treatment of interactions beyond pairwise relationships.

Method: Extends CAM framework to additive models with higher-order interactions, introduces directed acyclic hypergraphs as representation, provides theoretical foundations and identifiability results, and develops a greedy algorithm for hyper DAG learning.

Result: Shows that learning hypergraph structure can lead to better empirical results, with more restrictive assumptions like CAM corresponding to easier-to-learn hyper DAGs and improved finite sample complexity. Validates approach through synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: The extension of CAM to handle higher-order interactions via hyper DAGs provides a more comprehensive framework for causal structure learning that better captures complex real-world mechanisms while maintaining theoretical guarantees and practical learnability.

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SADQ improves DQN by using stochastic transition models to create policy-aligned successor-state distributions, reducing variance and improving stability in Q-value updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DQN suffers from high variance due to using next states from outdated policies in target updates, leading to suboptimal learning signals.

Method: Proposes Successor-state Aggregation Deep Q-Network (SADQ), which models environment dynamics with a stochastic transition model and integrates successor-state distributions into Q-value estimation.

Result: Theoretical guarantees of unbiased value estimates with reduced variance; empirical results show SADQ outperforms DQN variants in stability and learning efficiency across benchmarks.

Conclusion: SADQ effectively addresses DQN's limitations by aligning updates with current policy, offering a more stable and efficient reinforcement learning approach.

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that
SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our
extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world
vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN
variants in both stability and learning efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF) as a new time-series problem focused on predicting delayed outcomes from early interactions, with benchmark datasets from arXiv and GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social platforms show temporal patterns where early interactions (views, likes) lead to delayed outcomes (citations, forks), but lack standardized datasets hinder unified research.

Method: Created two benchmark datasets (arXiv: 2.3M papers, GitHub: 3M repos) with verified lead-lag dynamics, plus parametric/non-parametric baseline benchmarks.

Result: LLF established as a novel forecasting paradigm; datasets capture long-horizon dynamics, avoid survivorship bias, and enable systematic exploration.

Conclusion: LLF bridges a gap in time-series forecasting, with open data portal fostering further research in social and usage data analytics.

Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in
which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed,
sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or
reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an
early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads

*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecoHD introduces decomposition to hyperdimensional computing (HDC) by learning directly in a decomposed parameterization, achieving extreme memory savings with minimal accuracy loss while maintaining pure HDC inference compatible with in/near-memory accelerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HDC decomposition methods use fixed atomic hypervectors that are ill-suited for compressing learned class prototypes, leading to erosion of concentration and robustness when shrinking the feature axis.

Method: DecoHD learns in a decomposed HDC parameterization using a small shared set of per-layer channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end, compressing along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native bind-bundle-score operations.

Result: Achieves extreme memory savings with only 0.1-0.15% average accuracy degradation from baseline, more robust to random bit-flip noise, reaches accuracy plateau with ~97% fewer parameters, and delivers significant energy/speed gains: 277x/35x over CPU, 13.5x/3.7x over GPU, and 2.0x/2.4x over baseline HDC ASIC.

Conclusion: DecoHD successfully brings decomposition to HDC, enabling extreme compression while maintaining accuracy and robustness, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained deployments with in/near-memory accelerators.

Abstract: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O.
We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts
usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior
HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited
for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns
directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer
channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end,
yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses
along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native
bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC,
aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains
extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight
deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong
non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip
noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters,
and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU
(AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x
over a baseline HDC ASIC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multitask learning framework with behaviorally grounded mobility features to predict sociodemographic attributes from mobility data, improving accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data is challenging due to weak relationships between mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, and limited generalization across different contexts.

Method: Three approaches: 1) Behaviorally grounded higher-order mobility descriptors based on directed mobility graphs capturing trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel; 2) Metrics and visual diagnostic tools for model confidence and accuracy; 3) Multitask learning framework that jointly predicts multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation.

Result: The method significantly improves prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over baseline features. The multitask approach outperforms single-task models, especially with limited training data or when test set distribution differs from training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses key challenges in sociodemographic inference from mobility data by improving predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability, enabling better uncertainty quantification, and enhancing generalization across different contexts and time periods.

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

Motivation: Addressing the critical challenge of selecting high-quality synthetic data when real data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy constraints.

Method: Introduced proxy metrics including distribution/diversity-based measures adapted via embedding models, and proposed LENS - a novel proxy leveraging large language model reasoning for complex tasks.

Result: SynQuE proxies correlate with real task performance across diverse domains. On text-to-SQL parsing, top-3 synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE raised accuracy from 30.4% to 38.4% (+8.1%) compared to random selection.

Conclusion: SynQuE establishes a practical framework for synthetic data selection under real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data characterization and fine-grained selection.

Abstract: We introduce and formalize the Synthetic Dataset Quality Estimation (SynQuE)
problem: ranking synthetic datasets by their expected real-world task
performance using only limited unannotated real data. This addresses a critical
and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy
constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem
by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for
training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first
proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance
measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of
these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that
leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies
correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment
analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS
consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced
characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3
synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to
38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work
establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under
real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data
characterization and fine-grained data selection.

*Umut Çalıkyılmaz,Nitin Nayak,Jinghua Groppe,Sven Groppe*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: OptiMA framework addresses complexity pitfalls in multi-agent systems through transaction-based design and scheduling, showing 16% performance improvement with 100+ agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing complexity in multi-agent systems leads to susceptibilities to faults and performance bottlenecks.

Method: Proposed transaction-based framework for VCMAS design and integrated transaction scheduling; implemented as OptiMA framework.

Result: Framework successfully handles 100+ agents with up to 16% performance improvement from scheduling; theoretical analysis and practical tools provided.

Conclusion: OptiMA effectively manages complexity-related risks in multi-agent systems through transactions and scheduling, with scalable results and foundational tools for future research.

Abstract: In recent years, the research of multi-agent systems has taken a direction to
explore larger and more complex models to fulfill sophisticated tasks. We point
out two possible pitfalls that might be caused by increasing complexity;
susceptibilities to faults, and performance bottlenecks. To prevent the former
threat, we propose a transaction-based framework to design very complex
multi-agent systems (VCMAS). To address the second threat, we offer to
integrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented
both of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to
facilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents. We also
demonstrate the effect of transaction scheduling on such a system by showing
improvements up to more than 16\%. Furthermore, we also performed a theoretical
analysis on the transaction scheduling problem and provided practical tools
that can be used for future research on it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimization methods for LLM training rely on manual tuning or black-box searches, which are slow and can't keep up with rapidly evolving LLM domain, leading to slow development and underutilized resources.

Method: Multi-agent system with Coordinator, Analyzer, and Proposal agents that integrates LLM reasoning with performance profiling tools, roofline analysis, and a knowledge base of best practices and successful past optimizations.

Result: ASAP-generated sharding configurations achieved up to 28% training step time reduction and 1.43x throughput improvement. When combined with human expert optimization, throughput increased to 2.58x.

Conclusion: ASAP provides a scalable and explainable methodology for AI-assisted performance engineering in large-scale LLM training, automating bottleneck diagnosis and optimization recommendations.

Abstract: Optimizing large-language model (LLM) training on distributed domain-specific
accelerator systems presents significant challenges due to its complex
optimization space. Existing optimization methods, however, rely on
time-consuming manual tuning or resource-intensive black-box searches, which
struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving LLM domain, leading to slow
development and underutilized resources. To address this, we introduce ASAP, an
Agentic Solution to Auto-optimize Performance of Large-Scale LLM Training. It
is a multi-agent system, featuring Coordinator, Analyzer, and Proposal agents,
which integrates LLM reasoning with insights from performance profiling tools,
roofline analysis, and a knowledge base of best practices and successful past
optimizations from human experts. Our proposed design can automate the
diagnosis of performance bottlenecks and recommend optimized sharding
configurations with reasoning, thus effectively improving the efficiency of
distributed LLM training. Experiments have shown that the ASAP-generated
sharding configurations can contribute up to 28% training step time reduction
and 1.43 times throughput improvement. When combined with additional
optimization from human experts, throughput can be further increased to 2.58
times. The proposed ASAP promises to provide a scalable and explainable
methodology for AI-assisted performance engineering in large-scale LLM
training.

### [45] [Multi-Agent Collaborative Framework For Math Problem Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03958)
*Kia Karbasi,Kevin Hong,Mohammad Amin Samadi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A collaborative multi-agent framework for automatic question generation in mathematics education that uses multiple agents to iteratively refine question-answer pairs, improving balance between cognitive challenge and clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based language models struggle to precisely control problem complexity and cognitive demands in automatic question generation for mathematics education.

Method: Introduces a collaborative multi-agent framework that leverages multiple agents to iteratively refine generated question-answer pairs, incorporating inference-time computation into AQG.

Result: Preliminary evaluations show improved quality of generated educational content with better balance between cognitive challenge and clarity across five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance, importance, clarity, difficulty matching, and answerability.

Conclusion: Collaborative multi-agent workflows can yield more controlled, pedagogically valuable content that advances automated educational content generation and adaptive learning environments.

Abstract: Automatic question generation (AQG) for mathematics education remains an
elusive goal for Intelligent Tutoring Systems and educators. While pre-trained
transformer-based language models have significantly advanced natural language
generation, they often struggle to precisely control problem complexity and
cognitive demands. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative multi-agent
framework as a novel method of incorporating inference-time computation into
AQG. This approach leverages multiple agents that iteratively refine generated
question-answer pairs to better balance complexity and cognitive demand. We
evaluate the generated questions on five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance,
importance, clarity, difficulty matching, answerability, to assess the system's
ability to control the required complexity and quality of the questions.
Preliminary evaluations show that this collaborative multi-agent framework
elevates the quality of generated educational content by fostering a more
nuanced balance between cognitive challenge and clarity. These promising
outcomes suggest that integrating collaborative multi-agent workflows can yield
more controlled, pedagogically valuable content that can help advance automated
educational content generation and adaptive learning environments.
